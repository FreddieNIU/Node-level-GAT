Picking the best stocks for the new year isn’t about making predictions, but it’s about choosing high-quality companies with growth prospects and good value for shareholders.', 'Furthermore, it’s important to pick stocks for 2024 from a variety of market sectors. That way, investors can diversify their portfolios and avoid overdependence on one type of stock. So, let’s take a closer look at four picks for potentially powerful returns over the next 12 months — Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Macy’s (NYSE:M), NIO (NYSE:NIO), and Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW).', 'News flash — you’re not required to have a “Magnificent Seven” stock in your portfolio next year. Yet, it’s not a terrible idea to have at least one large-cap technology stock. I’m choosing Advanced Micro Devices, commonly abbreviated as AMD, because the company is aggressively pursuing the latest and greatest in artificial intelligence (AI) processor technology.', 'Not long ago, AMD\xa0showcased its AI-powered hardware solutions\xa0at Advancing AI, a tech-industry event. AMD CEO Lisa Su highlighted the company’s AI-compatible MI300 processors, saying, “We are seeing very strong demand for our new Instinct MI300 GPUs, which are the highest-performance accelerators in the world for generative AI.”', 'Furthermore, AMD’s management expects the company to generate over $2 billion in revenue next year just from the MI300 processor lineup. Therefore, investors should think about adding some AMD stock to capture potential gains from the AI hardware market.', 'On TipRanks, AMD is a Moderate Buy based on\xa025 Buys and nine Hold ratings in the past three months. Nonetheless, the average Advanced Micro Devices stock price target is $130.53, implying 5.8% downside potential.', 'Strong Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales figures demonstrated that the U.S. consumer is surprisingly resilient despite persistent inflation. Amid this bullish backdrop, beaten-down Macy’s stock appears to be making a comeback.', 'The positive momentum for Macy’s could continue in 2024, as the retailer has an excellent track record of beating analysts’ quarterly earnings forecasts. Besides, even after yesterday’s nearly 20% rally in M stock, Macy’s still has a trailing P/E ratio of 7.7x, which is well below the sector median of 17.2x.', 'Best of all, Macy’s received a $5.8 billion buyout offer from a pair of financial firms. If Macy’s gets a lifeline in the form of a buyout, the retailer could go from an apparent zero to a hero in 2024.', 'M stock is a Moderate Buy, based on\xa0five Buys,\xa0seven Holds, and\xa0one Sell rating in the past three months. The average Macy’s stock price target is $15.27, implying 17.7% upside potential.', 'The last thing any forward-looking investor should want to do is skip out on the electric vehicle (EV) revolution in 2024. Consequently, you’ll probably want to pick at least one EV manufacturing stock, and my choice is NIO stock.', 'As we’ll see in a moment, analysts generally expect NIO stock to move higher over the next 12 months. Most likely, analysts are bullish because NIO’s vehicle sales are growing rapidly.', 'The company’s numbers will amaze you. Believe it or not, NIO’s vehicle deliveries rose 75.4% year-over-year and 135.7% quarter-over-quarter in Q3 2023. Moreover, the company’s EV deliveries increased 12.6% year-over-year in November — not jaw-dropping, but not too bad. Thus, investors should try to think globally, and not just locally, and consider putting NIO stock on their watch lists.', 'According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus, NIO is a Moderate Buy based on\xa0six Buys and three Hold ratings. The average NIO stock price target is $11.36, implying 58% upside potential.', 'I haven’t forgotten about all the passive-income investors out there. Are you looking for a great dividend stock for 2024? Then check out Charles Schwab, commonly referred to as Schwab. The company has a dividend yield of 1.61%. Plus, it has grown its dividend payments at a compound annual growth rate of 16.8% over the past five years, so don’t be surprised if Schwab continues its dividend-growth pattern in the coming year.', 'Don’t just buy SCHW stock for the dividend, though. What matters the most is Schwab’s comeback story. Do you remember the banking scare from March and April? Schwab survived the “cash sorting” and bank run headlines, stayed profitable, and has posted nothing but quarterly earnings beats in 2023 so far.', 'Additionally, Barclays (NYSE:BCS) analyst\xa0Benjamin Budish recently reiterated his Buy rating on SCHW stock along with a price target of\xa0$66. Budish feels that fears about continuous cash outflows are subsiding — a point that I fully agree with. The market expects interest-rate cuts to happen next year, and this should encourage borrowing and lending activity. All of this, if it goes according to plan, could significantly support Schwab’s financials in 2024.', 'On TipRanks, SCHW stock comes in as a Moderate Buy based on\xa013 Buys,\xa0two Holds, and\xa0two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average Charles Schwab stock price target is $68.50, implying 5.13% upside potential.', 'As an investor, you can hedge your bets while still targeting growth in 2024. The idea is to choose a diversified set of prime businesses, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Macy’s, NIO, and Charles Schwab. By considering share positions in these and other well-researched businesses, you can hopefully enjoy a solid year of gains in your portfolio.', 'Disclosure']"

It climbed 0.3% after a 0.2% rise in October.The data has resulted in a shift in expectations regarding the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy.

However, not all sectors exhibit equal generosity in their dividend yields. Industries like real estate and energy tend to lead the pack, boasting substantial average yields nearing 4%, while the rapidly growing tech companies tend to be more reserved, offering considerably lower yields, averaging less than 1%.', ""The year 2023 hasn't been particularly kind to dividend stocks. Specifically, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, a collection of esteemed companies renowned for their consistent dividend increases, has seen a modest uptick of just 2.57% year-to-date. This pales in comparison to the noteworthy 21.4% return witnessed by the broader S&P 500 index over the same period. However, due to the historically strong performance of dividend stocks, analysts are recommending adding these equities to investors’ portfolios in 2024. Morningstar's chief U.S. market strategist, David Sekera, holds an optimistic view regarding dividend-paying stocks as they enter the year 2024. He believes that these stocks are in a stronger position compared to their standing in the previous year. Here are some comments from the analyst:"", '“High dividend-paying sectors such as communications, utilities, and real estate are trading at levels well below our fair value estimates. In addition, our U.S. economics team forecasts interest rates will decline over the course of 2024, which will provide a tailwind for dividend stocks, which tend to be more interest-rate-sensitive.”', 'Within dividend-paying sectors, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) stand out as one of the most sought-after choices. REITs have garnered immense popularity among investors seeking dividends due to their unique structure and inherent income-generating nature. By law, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, making them attractive for income-seeking investors. According to a report by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Listed REITs, comprising equity REITs and mortgage REITs, distributed approximately $63.1 billion to their shareholders. These listed REITs are publicly traded on stock exchanges, making their dividends widely accessible to investors. Additionally, public non-listed REITs, which function similarly to listed REITs but are not traded on public exchanges, paid out around $6.1 billion in dividends throughout the same period.', 'While REITs are renowned for their dividends, several other sectors in the market also offer solid dividend payouts to shareholders.

A fiscal tightening by the Federal Reserve to tackle soaring prices also led to recession fears. The United States economy, however, weathered these storms to emerge stronger than ever. Analysts are now predicting a major boom for stocks. Ed Yardeni, a prominent financial analyst and founder of Yardeni Research, has forecast that the benchmark S&P 500 will jump 30% to 6,000 by 2025.\xa0', 'Tech firms will remain a key driver of this growth, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), all of which feature in the Fortune 500, an annual list compiled and published by Fortune magazine that ranks 500 of the largest United States corporations by total revenue, expected to benefit from the economic boom. The stocks of these three companies are up by 58%, 56%, and 50% this year. After a 12% plunge in 2022, the benchmark S&P 500 is likely to end 2023 with 14% in gains.\xa0', 'This optimism is riding on recent statements from the Federal Reserve that indicate that rate cuts will begin next year. On December 14, Fed chief Jerome Powell said that the Fed was done raising rates as inflation cooled. Stocks rallied and bond yield shrunk after that statement, with analysts jacking up their price forecasts for the coming months. The Fed is expected to make three quarter point cuts to the benchmark interest rates next year. These rates had been at their highest level since 2001 after record inflation in 2022.\xa0', 'Not everybody is convinced about the emerging trends. In late November, prominent investment firm JPMorgan released a gloomy forecast for 2024. In a transition year for the economy, the investment bank predicted that the benchmark S&P 500 would drop to around 4,200 by the end of 2024. The bank identified shrinking global growth and household savings, rising geopolitical risks, and elections in the United States that could add to policy volatility as some of the prime reasons behind this pessimistic forecast.\xa0', 'The position of JPMorgan stands in contrast to others on Wall Street. In addition to Yardeni, famous firms like Bank of America and Deutsche Bank have also backed the S&P 500 to touch record highs next year. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also constructive on the index, with David Kostin at the former and Mike Wilson at the latter both predicting that the index will come close to the previous peak in the next few months. The average analyst estimate for the index for 2024 sits at around 4,664, per Bloomberg.\xa0', 'Investors eager to get on top of these growth trends should have a listen to recent remarks by Sundar Pichai, the CEO of tech firm Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), said during the third quarter earnings call that his firm was pleased with the growth in search, short videos, and cloud services. Pichai highlighted the market opportunity offered by the rapid evolution of products and services in the artificial intelligence domain and urged investors to focus on strides being made in countries like India and Japan.

(NYSE:UPS) renegotiated a wage increase for its union-backed workforce this summer, which weighed on margins that were already being constricted by slowing volumes.

It's been mixed in terms of the consumer. On the one hand, inflation has been a headwind for sure, and consumer discretionary trends have been more negative as inflation has taken away dollars. That being said, there's still a lot of spending power. Unemployment is low at below 4%. $700 billion of savings on the sidelines.

There are winners and losers, aspirational luxury, more entry price luxury has been a tougher place. Discretionary has been a tougher place.

In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Nordstrom ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Nordstrom is:', '16% = US$119m ÷ US$729m (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.16 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Nordstrom has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Multiline Retail industry average (18%).', ""That's neither particularly good, nor bad. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If true, then it is more an indication of risk than the potential. You can see the 5 risks we have identified for Nordstrom by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here."", ""Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking."", ""It appears that Nordstrom makes extensive use of debt to improve its returns, because it has an alarmingly high debt to equity ratio of 3.92. Its ROE is respectable, but it's not so impressive once you consider all of the debt."", 'Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have the same ROE, then I would generally prefer the one with less debt.', 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too.

While the Federal Reserve has worked hard to bring down the rate of inflation, purchasing power for consumers is not as robust at the moment. As a result, people have been forced to make tougher decisions while out shopping.', ""The side effect is that retail stores in particular have struggled to entice consumers to spend.

The bigger picture is that Realty Income is augmenting its portfolio with a complementary business that could produce significant benefits down the road."", 'The company is forecasting the deal to contribute meaningful accretion to funds from operations (FFO), which may be getting overlooked given the current price action of the stock.', 'While REITs are attractive for their dividends, there is an extra reason to like Realty Income. The company actually pays its dividend monthly. And it has increased its dividend for over 100 consecutive quarters.', ""With the stock trading at a 5.7% dividend yield, it's hard to pass on the opportunity to scoop up shares near a three-year low. Furthermore, the long-term theme of consistently increasing its dividend for decades underscores the resiliency of Realty Income and its ability to navigate challenging economies."", 'I see two obvious benefits of buying shares in Realty Income right now. The first is that you would be opening a position at a historically low price, all while benefiting from some monthly dividend income.', ""The second is the potential of the Spirit Realty deal. The sell-off in the stock following the announcement of the deal appears overblown. Some investors might believe this was an attempt to try to distract from a more obvious concern: the state of the economy. I don't see it that way."", ""Moreover, investors shouldn't discount Realty Income's potential should there be a slowdown anyway. The company appears well-positioned to benefit in the long run, regardless of inflation. Now looks like an interesting time to consider buying shares in this retail REIT.

In late October, it announced plans to acquire Spirit Realty Capital in an all-share deal valued at $9.3 billion. Spirit's commercial real estate portfolio will complement the diversity of Realty Income's asset portfolio, and expand the combined company into new industries."", ""What's more, Realty Income has shifted into gaming, with two significant deals over the past year. Diversifying its real estate portfolio will make it even less reliant on the ebbs and flows of the U.S. economy."", ""Realty Income's occupancy rate is also far superior to its peers'. Realty Income's portfolio has produced an average occupancy rate of 98.2% since the start of 2000. That compares to an average occupancy rate for the median REIT of 94.2% over the same timeline. The predictability of its adjusted funds from operations is simply unmatched among retail REITs."", 'A second ultra-high-yield stock that can help you bring home $200 each month in 2024 is business development company (BDC) PennantPark Floating Rate Capital (NYSE: PFLT). PennantPark has increased its monthly payout twice since the year began.', 'BDCs are businesses that invest in either the debt or equity of middle-market companies (typically micro-cap and small-cap businesses). Despite ending September with nearly $161 million in common and preferred stock in its portfolio, the more than $906 million in debt securities held makes PennantPark a primarily debt-focused BDC.', ""The clear advantage of a debt-driven operating model is the yield PennantPark receives. Since most micro-cap and small-cap companies are unproven, they have limited access to traditional debt and credit markets. This means any financing they do receive tends to sport high yields. As of the end of September, PennantPark's weighted average yield on debt investments was a whopping 12.6%!"", ""What's even more important is that the entirety of PennantPark Floating Rate Capital's debt-securities portfolio has variable interest rates. Since March 2022, the Federal Reserve has increased the federal funds target rate by 525 basis points. Each rate hike is padding PennantPark's proverbial pockets, as evidenced by its 520-basis-point improvement in weighted average yield on debt investments since Sept. 30, 2021. As long as the nation's central bank remains hawkish, PennantPark and its shareholders will benefit."", ""Another reason income investors can place their trust in PennantPark is the company's principal protection strategy. It almost exclusively owns first-lien secured debt -- just $0.1 million of its $906.3 million debt securities portfolio isn't first-lien secured. First-lien secured debtholders are first in line for repayment in the event that a borrower seeks bankruptcy protection."", ""Additionally, PennantPark is invested in 131 companies, including its equity stakes. No single investment is critical to PennantPark's success, nor capable of seriously hurting its operating performance."", ""The third ultra-high-yield stock that can help you receive $200 in monthly dividend income in 2024 from an initial investment of $27,000 (split equally, three ways) is BDC Horizon Technology Finance (NASDAQ: HRZN). Horizon's yield has hovered around the 10% mark for much of the past decade."", ""Horizon's operating model is similar to PennantPark Floating Rate Capital's, but with a few twists. In particular, Horizon Technology Finance is primarily dealing with developmental-stage companies in exclusively high-growth fields, such as technology, life sciences, and renewable energy. Though there's certainly risk involved when investing in developmental-stage businesses, there's also plenty of reward when those businesses are properly vetted."", 'As of the end of September, Horizon had around $49 million invested in an assortment of equity stakes and warrants. But like PennantPark, it has $680 million in debt securities, which makes it a debt-driven BDC.', ""Having an aforementioned focus on developmental-stage businesses has led to significantly higher yields. Since Horizon is offering financing to unproven companies, it ended the third quarter with a dollar-weighted annualized yield on its debt investments of 17.1%. That's roughly four times higher than the current yield on 10-year Treasury notes."", ""Despite macro challenges, Horizon Technology Finance has also done a stand-up job of protecting its principal. Though higher interest rates have increased the delinquency rate for developmental-stage businesses, 86.5% of the company's debt investments at fair value are tied up in businesses Horizon deems to have high credit quality or offer standard levels of risk."", ""To build on the above, a good portion of Horizon's debt securities have variable interest rates. A big uptick in income from the 86.5% of its debt portfolio that isn't a concern as interest rates have risen has more than offset any potential losses from its other debt securities."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

But the best may be yet to come. The arrival of the first spot Bitcoin ETF is now expected in the first quarter of 2024, and that will be followed by one of the most highly anticipated events in the crypto industry: the Bitcoin halving.', ""While it's not a guarantee that these two catalysts will extend the Bitcoin rally into 2024, there is one way that you can get access to the potential upside of Bitcoin without having to deal with the risk and volatility of the crypto market. And that's by buying crypto stocks that are highly correlated with Bitcoin's price. Two of the best options right now are MicroStrategy\xa0(NASDAQ: MSTR) and Riot Platforms\xa0(NASDAQ: RIOT)."", ""Let's start with MicroStrategy, which is the largest public holder of Bitcoin in the world, by a long shot. About 0.75% of the entire Bitcoin supply in the world is now on MicroStrategy's balance sheet."", ""At the end of November, MicroStrategy scooped up another 16,130 Bitcoins and now holds 174,530 Bitcoins. By way of comparison, that's 12 times more Bitcoin than held by Marathon Digital Holdings, the largest publicly traded Bitcoin mining company. And it's 17 times more Bitcoin than held by Coinbase Global,\xa0the second-largest cryptocurrency exchange in the world."", ""In short, MicroStrategy is just about as good of a proxy for Bitcoin as you're going to get in the stock market. Right now, the market values MicroStrategy at about $9 billion. The amount of Bitcoin on its balance sheet is valued at $7.5 billion. So most of the value of the company is based on the value of Bitcoin! This explains why MicroStrategy is up more than 300% this year. As long as the company continues to add to its Bitcoin position in 2024, its value should also continue to skyrocket."", ""While Riot Platforms is not the largest Bitcoin mining stock, it's generally acknowledged as among the best run and the most cost effective. In large part, this is due to Riot's strategy of continually upgrading to the most efficient and powerful Bitcoin mining rigs."", 'Every month, Riot Platforms releases a Bitcoin production update, and the numbers continue to look good. In November 2023, the amount of Bitcoin mined increased 21% on a month-over-month basis. At the same time, the number of mining rigs deployed increased by 6% on a month-over-month basis. There are plans to deploy even more mining rigs in 2024, and all signs point to Riot Platforms going all in on the Bitcoin halving next year.', ""While Riot Platforms is up more than 350% this year, there may still be more room to run. According to J.P. Morgan, analyst price forecasts for Riot range as high as $23. That would be a 50% increase from today's price of a little moire than $15."", ""And if you look at how Riot Platforms performed during the last Bitcoin halving in 2020, there's even more room for hope. The stock went from $2 in May 2020 to $10 by year-end. And then, in 2021, the stock went parabolic, more than quadrupling in value. Just keep in mind, though, that past results are no guarantee of future performance. But it's certainly instructive for seeing just how much of an impact the Bitcoin halving might have on Riot's price."", ""The main caveat, of course, is that these stocks are not hidden gems. Everybody in the crypto industry knows about them. That's why both are up so much this year. So it could be the case that they have already gone up too far, too fast, and won't be able to replicate the same type of performance in 2024."", ""But I don't think that's the case. There are two strong catalysts in place for Bitcoin next year, and it's likely that Bitcoin will continue to gain in value next year. That's why I've specifically highlighted two stocks that are directly tied to Bitcoin's price. If Bitcoin is ready to rise even higher next year, then these two stocks are likely to go along for the ride."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in MicroStrategy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in MicroStrategy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and MicroStrategy wasn’t one of them.

This increases business value and ROI by unifying unstructured data, including PDFs, emails, documents, and transcripts, with structured data, including purchase history, customer support cases, and product inventory, to power AI, automation, and analytics across every Salesforce application.', 'For example, customer service leaders will enhance efficiency and customer satisfaction by utilizing a platform that proactively presents relevant knowledge articles to service agents the moment a case is created.

To improve customer experiences, call center leaders can use unstructured data and AI to automatically compare cases and identify those that are similar in their intent, triggering automated Flows that alert case owners if a new case is a potential duplicate. Service leaders can also use analytics tools like Tableau to cluster knowledge articles and spot trends across newly created cases and articles, helping uncover new ways to deliver better customer experiences.', 'Marketers can tailor campaigns based on consumer intent and behavior. When building a campaign, a marketer can use Marketing Cloud Intelligence to understand consumer intent by analyzing unstructured survey data and transcripts in Data Cloud, then iterate on email templates and copy them directly from within Einstein Copilot through natural language instructions.', 'Commerce teams can generate new product descriptions faster. When creating a product description, a brand manager can ask Einstein Copilot to compare the details of a new product against existing products that are similar. They can use the information contained in product catalogs from closely related products to generate relevant descriptions quickly.', 'Sales can increase revenue using AI to surface insights from prior customer interactions. To prepare for a customer meeting, a sales rep can have Einstein Copilot reference specific unstructured data, like a customer’s 10-K or past email interactions, and ask questions about that data. Responses will include relevant information such as the top three initiatives for the customer’s company in the next fiscal year and who the new executive bench includes, setting the sales rep up with valuable insights for their meeting.', 'IT can discover problems and anomalies in product telemetry. Unstructured content produced from machine operations, including machine logs, sensor readings, images, or audio recordings, can be ingested into Data Cloud. Tableau can then analyze this data and Einstein can identify and flag unusual data points through semantic similarity that reveal problems with the equipment.', 'Customer perspective:', '""With Salesforce automation and AI technology, we have reduced response time for our 6 million annual roadside events by 10%. Our reps have access to real-time data, helping them quote field service arrival times more accurately, automate fleet deployment, and personalize service to members in crisis.

Invisalign Palatal Expanders are intended for use in rapid expansion and subsequent holding of skeletal and/or dental narrow maxilla (upper jaw) with primary, mixed, or permanent dentition during treatment of patients. The Invisalign Palatal Expander is Align’s first direct 3D printed orthodontic device and provides a safe, comfortable, and clinically effective* alternative to traditional palatal expanders that require manually turning a screw in the device in the mouth daily to achieve expansion.', 'The Invisalign Palatal Expander System consists of a series of removable devices staged in small increments of movement to expand a patient’s narrow maxilla to a position determined by their treating doctor.** Each direct 3D printed device is customized to the patient’s unique anatomy based on an iTero™ intraoral digital scan. A palatal expansion treatment plan and device design are then developed using Align’s proprietary AI-driven orthodontic software.', 'Combined with Invisalign First™ aligners, Invisalign Palatal Expanders provide doctors with a full early intervention treatment solution for Phase 1 treatment, an early interceptive orthodontic treatment for young patients. Phase 1 treatment is traditionally done through arch expanders or partial metal braces, before all permanent teeth have erupted – typically at ages 6 through 10.

For the second quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended on Nov. 30, its revenue rose 5% year over year to $12.9 billion but missed analysts' estimates by $110 million. Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew 11% to $1.34 and exceeded expectations by a penny."", ""Those headline numbers weren't terrible, but investors had expected better results to justify the stock's year-to-date rally of about 40% prior to its earnings report. Let's review the three reasons to buy Oracle's stock -- as well as three reasons to sell it -- to see if it's still a worthwhile investment after its recent post-earnings pullback."", ""Oracle is the world's largest database software company. Over the past decade, it transformed a lot of its on-site software into cloud-based services to keep pace with the evolving market. To accelerate that transformation, it acquired a long list of companies -- including the cloud giant NetSuite in 2016 and the healthcare IT leader Cerner in 2022."", ""Most of Oracle's recent growth was driven by the expansion of its cloud business and enterprise resource planning (ERP) services. The company's stable profitability and repatriation of its overseas cash also generated plenty of cash for its buybacks and dividends. That's how it bought back nearly 40% of its outstanding shares over the past decade."", ""Oracle's growth is cooling off as the macro headwinds drive companies to rein in their spending, but it has three notable strengths:"", 'Its margins are expanding.', 'Its free cash flow (FCF) is growing.', ""It's returning a lot of its cash to its investors."", ""Oracle's adjusted operating margin grew two percentage points year over year and sequentially to 43% in the second quarter. For the first half of the year, its adjusted operating margin also improved two percentage points to 42%. It attributes that expansion to the improved scale of its cloud business, its focus on growing Cerner's profits, and other cost-cutting measures."", 'As a result, its trailing 12-month FCF grew 20% year over year to $10.1 billion by the end of Q2. That healthy FCF growth enabled it to buy back $600 million in shares in the first half of the year while paying out $2.2 billion in dividends.', 'However, the bears will point out:', ""Oracle's cloud growth is decelerating;"", 'Its dividend is too low.', ""Its stock isn't a bargain relative to other blue-chip tech stocks."", ""Oracle's total cloud revenue (including Cerner) grew 24% year over year to $4.8 billion, or 37% of its top line, in Q2. Within that total, its infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) revenue increased 50% as its software-as-a-service (SaaS) revenue rose 14%. But all three of those growth rates cooled from the first quarter when its total cloud revenue grew 29%, its IaaS revenue jumped 64%, and its SaaS revenue rose 17%."", ""That deceleration is worrisome when we consider that Microsoft's cloud growth accelerated in its latest quarter, while Amazon's cloud growth held steady. Oracle's recent decision to tether its own databases to Microsoft's Azure instead of locking them into its own Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) platform also suggests it's falling behind Microsoft, Amazon, and other tech giants in the crowded cloud infrastructure market."", ""Oracle has spent a lot more cash on its dividends than on its buybacks this year, but its paltry forward yield of 1.4% won't attract any serious income investors as long as CDs and Treasury bonds are paying yields of over 5%. Meanwhile, its decision to spend less cash on buybacks this year (compared to its $16.2 billion in buybacks in fiscal 2022 and $1.3 billion in buybacks in fiscal 2023) suggests the company doesn't think its shares are extremely undervalued."", ""Oracle's forward multiple of 21 might seem reasonable, but other blue chip tech stocks like Cisco Systems and HP trade at 13 and 9 times forward earnings, respectively. Cisco and HP also pay higher dividends."", ""Oracle is still a decent investment for long-term investors, but it's easy to find higher-growth cloud stocks or cheaper dividend-paying tech stocks.

Gentlemen, great to have you both here."", 'Andy Cross: Hey, Dylan.', 'Ron Gross: How are you doing, Dylan?', ""Dylan Lewis: We've got the pandemic's enduring impact on households and companies. Some earnings updates from a couple of Fool favorites and, of course, stocks on our radar, but we are kicking off this week with the Big Macro run. First Friday of the month, that means we got a fresh jobs report. What did you see in the numbers?"", ""Ron Gross: The report was a little stronger than expected, meaning more jobs were created, and the unemployment rate actually ticked down to 3.7% from 3.9%. A lot of people are focusing on that number. It's interesting to me. More importantly I think everyone is keeping an eye on wages as a gauge of inflation, and wages were up by 0.4% for the month and 4% from a year ago, so up for the month, but that 4% number is actually not that bad. That is not runaway inflation by any means. That is moderating, which I think people are going to like. I think these numbers actually bode well for a soft landing, and you can quote me, although I very well may be wrong, but I do think these numbers bode well for that. The market was mixed but generally positive on Friday as a result of these numbers, but time will tell."", ""Dylan Lewis: I cannot wait to revisit it about 12 months [laughs] from now and see exactly where we're checking in. We see some uptick in the arms race for generative AI. Andy, we have this week Google parent, Alphabet, publicly launching Gemini, its AI model inside its chatbot. Bard investors seem very happy to see this development, shares up 5% this week on the news. What did you see?"", ""Andy Cross: The timing of all this is very interesting, considering the open AI drama that we're seeing and continue to see in the boardroom. It's this Game of Thrones contest between all of the great challengers, Google, Microsoft. We heard a lot of talk coming from Andy Jassy at Amazon at AWS. This was really interesting because Google has been investing in AI for years and years, and they've just been outrun by OpenAI and Microsoft over the last year. They tried to come out with some Bard fireworks earlier this year. It really flailed. There's just a lot of questions about it. What is their strategy. Clearly, they've been investing and thinking a lot about this. They have all the leaders on board. Sundar Pichai was all about releasing this and doing a very slick video on the leaders and getting together all the different divisions. So it's nice for shareholders and those of us who are really invested into understanding AI. This is actually a really neat development with this Gemini 1.0 in three different phases, the Ultra, the Pro, and the Nano depending on your needs. Dylan, what I'm really excited about this is how they are going to use this at the Enterprise for their clients as they think about the Cloud buy-in with their clients and supporting their clients who are spending more money in the Google Cloud and how those tools and their AI tools are going to drive that usage and encourage more adoption and usage of these tools for the Google Cloud. Overall, very impressive technology. It was very impressive, and we'll see how it all develops over the next few months."", ""Dylan Lewis: You mentioned the Enterprise segment there, Andy, and I think one of the things that's so interesting, this is a nascent space. I think we just lapped the one year anniversary or the one year birthday of OpenAI being out there and available. On the generative AI side, I think one of the things that's very fun about the technology is it's visible. It's something you can interact with and play around with. Is there anything that you're watching or people can keep an eye on as they're interacting with some of this stuff, just to see signs of people maybe taking a lead or developing in the space?"", ""Andy Cross: Let's just focus on the Google part to this. They are talking about how, over the next few months, they're going to start to integrate this into more tools like Search. Now the Pro version is their backbone to Bard search, which has been available for a while, and now it's getting even more enhanced, but you'll start to see this across the entire platform of the tools that we use. Even consumers, let alone clients, or let alone enterprises. You'll start to see more of adoption of these tools into the tools that we use everyday. I'm really interested to see what Apple does because got Siri search and Siri usage and their AI tools there on the consumer side leave a lot to be desired, so it'll be very interesting to see how they innovate in that space. But look for more AI tools integrated throughout the tools like Gmail or whatever you might use as a consumer because that will be a litmus test on how fast this is adopting in the consumer side."", 'Ron Gross: I just got a new iPhone, and it crippled me for a week until I could figure it all out, so I can only imagine what AI has got coming for me.', ""Dylan Lewis: I don't think anyone's pounding the table on Siri's capabilities. I think Siri does leave a lot to be desired, as you were saying there, Andy. From one era of technology to another, we have a curious development over at GameStop. Ron, this week, the meme stock company announced that company cash can be used to invest in public companies by company leadership, Ryan Cohen. I'm a little curious. This sounds like an odd update. Is this an odd update?"", ""Ron Gross: It's an odd update. It's certainly not common, as one esteemed analyst called it, inane and alarming. GameStop should be focusing on turning its business. If they believe in that business, perhaps they should be buying back stock with their cash rather than making other equity investments, but that turnaround is not going well. Recent sales were down 9%, 25% since the same period in 2019. Losses did narrow, I'll give them that. Aggressive cost cuts, store closing in Europe, that helped, but it's certainly not growing the business. It's shrinking the business which, if necessary, so be it, but I guess they're looking for some other ways to generate value. This is tricky. They got to be careful. They could end up violating the Investment Act if more than 40% of their assets are in investments that are unrelated to their actual business. I'm sure their lawyers have informed them, but take it from me that you should be careful and keep an eye on that number."", ""Dylan Lewis: One of the other things I saw related to this update was Ryan Cohen will also be able to invest alongside GameStop personally in anything that he's directing the company to own. It seems to me like so much of the GameStop story is a bet on Ryan Cohen, and we've seen a lot of interest in that. To me this only further solidifies that that is the case here."", ""Ron Gross: I'll remind folks that Ryan and his company is still the largest shareholder of Chewy, largest shareholder of GameStop. He's somewhat famous for the meme craze, trading in and out of GameStop, Bed Bath and Beyond. He's an interesting figure. Disclosure, if he's buying stock along outside a public company, I think everyone needs to know when and how much and why, and if these things are happening behind the scenes, it will not go well."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, more Chewy. We've got 10 earnings rundown and follow up on last week's Radar Stocks. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis here in the studio with Andy Cross and Ron Gross. We've got an earnings parade and some updates from a couple of different companies that are heavily followed in the Fool universe. Andy, we're going to kick off with DocuSign. It was our colleague, Jason Moser's Radar stock last week. Now we've got some updated earnings. What did you see in the company's results?"", ""Andy Cross: There wasn't a lot baked into the expectations coming in DocuSign. The stock has really struggled here. Decent results showing healthy growth in revenues and a better margin picture, we'll get to that in a second, but billions continue to be on the lower side, and the forecast of low single-digit growth is not super exciting. New CEO Allan Thygesen continues to try to position DocuSign as the leader in both e-signature and more and more about contract life cycle management. He's invested a lot in that, and he continually wants to grow the business above that 10% range. We'll see how it does. Revenue is up 8.5% to 700 million, billings as I mentioned up 5% to 692 million. They added 36,000 customers. That was up 11%. Direct digital continues to be the largest contributor and the direct consumer growth, so just like through the digital platform and directly with DocuSign was up 15%."", ""Steady gross margins at 80%, what you're seeing now with DocuSign is a focus on smart investments. They continue to invest a lot in R&D. Research and development was 19% of sales, that's consistent as for the past couple of quarters. Their operating income was up 27%, their operating margin was 27% versus 23%, cash earnings were 79% versus 57, so you're seeing a lot of investment go into managing the business, driving profits, and driving cash flow. The challenge is that the macro environment is not doing a lot for them right now. They are seeing some of their verticals improving and stabilizing from the first half, especially in things like real estate and some of the other verticals, like technology, but overall, it's no longer the 20% gross story that DocuSign used to be dealing. It's much more about that single to high digit grower, and Thygesen and his team really want to get it back above 10% internationally, a big driver of that, so we'll have to watch what we do. You've basically got a value stock churning at 17 times free cash flow. It can grow in the mid single digits. That's a pretty good deal at this price."", ""Dylan Lewis: It's looking attractive to you, Andy?"", ""Andy Cross: Yeah. I bought a little bit earlier this summer. I'm down a little bit on it, and I think long term you'll do pretty well, and nothing like a fireworks like you may have seen back during the COVID days, of course."", 'Dylan Lewis: Ron, we also have an update on the state of Phyto. [laughs] Head supplier, Chewy, posted earnings this week. This is a stock that bottomed out a bit in 2023. Are there positive signs in their earnings report?', ""Ron Gross: I think if you look under the hood, there are some positive signs. The stock initially got whacked, the investors just did not like what they saw, but the stock rebounded as the week progressed. They did miss on both the top and bottom lines, which I think was that caused that knee jerk reaction, but I'll point out some interesting metrics here. Net sales were up 8%, and management noted that Chewy gained market share during the period, pretty good. Net sales per active customer up nearly 14%. That means their average customer is spending more money on the platform than in previous periods, also important. Auto-ship customer sales were up 13% and now represent over 76% of net sales. You have customers spending more per customer and that recurring revenue is occurring because they're mostly all on auto ship. That can be a powerful combination. They ended the third quarter with about 20.3 million active customers, that is down slightly sequentially from the second quarter. Let's keep an eye on that. But margins did widen. Company reported a loss of around $36,000,000, adjusted EBITDA, if that's your cup of tea, Dylan, [laughs] was $82.1 million positive up $11.7 million. You can maybe take away some things there that at least from a cash flow perspective, not taking stock-based compensation into account. Some things are traveling in the right direction. Adjusted EBITDA margin, 3%, so thin, but there should be some leverage in this business as they continue to grow, and there's room for that. 0.7 times sales from a stock perspective, I'm not a sales ratio kind of guy, but that could indicate some cheapness."", ""Dylan Lewis: Wow, a sales multiple and adjusted earnings numbers, Ron, what's going on over there?"", 'Ron Gross: Anything for our listeners.', ""Dylan Lewis: [laughs] One of the things that jumped out to me in this report was the company really emphasizing its pharmacy business. I think they said it's about to hit a one billion run rate, and they are the number one pet pharmacy in the United States. This is not a particularly old initiative. This is I think in Year 4 or 5 for them. Ron, are you surprised by that?"", ""Ron Gross: It's taken them a while to get to scale, but that doesn't surprise me. I think it would. Pharmacy should be a higher margin business than their typical hard goods segment, so that could bode well for overall margins, overall profitability, and make the growth story even more powerful."", ""Dylan Lewis: From pets to people, shares of Lululemon now at an all time high following the company's latest earnings result. Andy, what is pushing the company so high this week?"", ""Andy Cross: Interestingly after the earnings came out, the pre-market and post-market print was not really inspiring. Now we saw it just hit those all time highs as you mentioned. It continues to be the leader when it comes to not just athleisure, but really high-end apparel. The apparel market in general is not doing that well, but Lululemon continues to do well. Revenue is up 18%, the women's business was up 19%, men up 15%, their accessories up 29%, international was a big driver up more than 49%. North America up 12%, so a little bit on the lower side. Of course it's much more saturated. Their comp sales were up 13%, 9% on the store side, 19% on the e-commerce side. They added 63 new stores over the past year. That's about 17% increase in square footage. Their record Thanksgiving Day sales cycle, the US market share continues to grow. It was up about 1.5 percentage points, and you're seeing improvements on the gross profit and the operating profit side too. Dylan, it's a business that continues to speak to their customer, continues to deliver what those customers want, and those customers are continuing to show willingness to pay for it. Now there was some concern a little bit on the guidance, especially, I think on some of the men's side that maybe men are becoming a little bit more particular about what they may spend on and how much they're willing to spend. I think that was a little bit of concern when we look forward to the growth prospects for the fourth quarter which is sales growth of about 13-14%, but overall this is just a winning business. Their strategy continues to win. They have that new deal with Peloton. That is hopefully going to open up more and more of the market for those who are using Peloton, and that's why the stock is really at an all time high and continues to do well."", ""Dylan Lewis: I don't know if this is a bell weather, but Ron Gross owns two pairs of Lululemon pants and hasn't ever seen a yoga studio. They have golf pants. They've got joggers that don't sleep on the men's side."", ""Andy Cross: Their inventories were down 4%, so it's not a discounting story, they are continuing to sell very high margin product, and their customers are buying it like Ron Gross."", ""Dylan Lewis: I believe they're on your shopping list as well, Andy."", ""Andy Cross: They are on my shopping list. I've been looking for some pants, and it's about time that I stepped up because I've been a little bit more of the discount kind of guy, but I think now Lululemon may be the way to go. My brother uses Lululemon, so he listens to the show there, so Gordon, there you go."", 'Dylan Lewis: We are opening ourselves up to advertising at some point. We may consider Lululemon as a sponsor. We have some host right experience right there for you. How perfect is that? We are going to wrap up our earnings updates in the grocery aisle. JM Smucker up 7% on strong earnings this week. Ron, moms like you continue to choose Jiff even at higher prices.', 'Ron Gross: And Uncrustables, it turns out, it was very strong.', ""Dylan Lewis: This is an interesting story to me and I think it's one investors should maybe take a look at. The stock got whacked back in September on the announcement that they were going to acquire Hostess for $5.6 billion. Perhaps they thought the fit was interesting or they were paying too much, but it created a situation where the stock was perhaps inexpensive. But they've got a great staple of brands, it's folders, and Smuckers, and jiff, and milk bone, it's a family run business. CEO is Fifth Generation Smucker, which is better than Gross. It's an interesting company to me and they're divesting some of their less profitable brands. The quarter, not bad, comp sales up 7%. The Uncrustables was a hot spot there, 22% increase. Sales volume contributed 4%, price contributed 3%, so if you've got both higher volumes and the ability to pass along price increases rather powerful in my opinion. Gross margins widened pretty significantly and profits were strong. They did lower their guidance a little bit of fear about the macro-economy and spending out there. But based on current forward guidance, only 12.5 times forward guidance, they've increased their dividend for 21 consecutive years, 3.8% yield, not too shabby. I do think some risks include, we're moving toward a healthier eating situation. The weight loss drugs are going to be very interesting for companies like Smucker and Hostess, but I do think this is one worth looking at. Andy mentioned earlier that there was a surprisingly good quarter for Lululemon, and we're seeing surprisingly strong results on the grocery aisle as well. Do you feel like the long waited consumer tightening is maybe taking a little bit longer or may or may not materialize, Ron?"", ""Ron Gross: Consumers right now are still in this shying away from big ticket non-discretionary items and focusing on the food items that they need to feed their family. The peanut butters, the jellies, the Uncrustables, and the coffee, which we all desperately can't give that up. That'll be interesting to watch because the consumer, I think, is also taxed. Savings accounts are coming down, credit card balances are going up, this all feeds into this whole big macro thing about is are we going through a recession or a soft landing? But I think stable brands that Smucker owns are going to be good consistently over long periods of time."", ""Dylan Lewis: Ron Gross, Andy Cross, fellows, we're going to catch you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next we've got to look at the business and economic fragility at the COVID pandemic exposed and now we might fix it. Stay right here, you're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. We're still waiting our way out of the pandemic, but we're now in a position to process and reflect what happened and the response. Journalist and author Bethany McLean has made a career out of sorting through complicated and often calamitous events and her latest book, The Big Fail, takes a look at the last three years, how we responded to COVID, and the lasting effects on households, businesses, and the economy. Motley Fool Money's Deidre Woollard spoke with McLean about her book and the issues she's paying attention to as we head into 2024."", ""Deidre Woollard: In your writing career, one of the things it feels like to me from the outside, reading your books, is you've focused on uncovering the decisions that lead to big outcomes often not the best outcomes. Here some of this was the urgency I think, around the pandemic led to poor decision making. I think that's a theme I've seen in your other books too. I know why I make stupid decisions based on urgency. But why does it happen so much in business, given that we've got information, you've got preparation, and yet when the moment comes, bad mistakes just keep happening."", ""Bethany McLean: I think on some level it's completely understandable. Back to the first question you asked, because when what is inconceivable happens, even if it was always a possibility of which we should have been aware, we're all just shocked. I often say that the best lesson anybody can learn is that when we learned in kindergarten, use your imagination because these things that you think in advance, well, that can't happen, that won't happen too often, they do, whether it's the global financial crisis or the pandemic. They do happen. I forgive everybody, some degree of shock when that happens, but I also think the reality of our system, and it's why I find some of the lessons from the pandemic, they're not just about the pandemic, they're about our society and the way business operates. We've just stretched everything to the breaking point in the name of efficiency, in the name of profits. I think we've forgotten that resiliency matters too. When something unexpected happens, it turns out often that there's not a lot of padding in the system to absorb it, and so people panic in part because of the lack of padding. One thing that exacerbated the panic, one concrete example is we couldn't get PPE because we'd outsourced all the manufacturing of PPE to China. We couldn't just turn on a dime and start manufacturing masks and gowns and all the other things gloves and all the other things we needed here. That's an example of just lack of resiliency as a result of having made things very, very fragile in the name of increased efficiency and profits. There's a cost to that, we forget that there's a cost to that."", ""Deidre Woollard: You have a chapter on the Fed's moves and quantitative easing. There was this line that stuck with me about how the enormity of the Fed's rescue revealed the fragility of our financial system. I think that's a theme throughout the book about the fragility of various systems and just how much the Fed had to prop up everything. I think to the extent that a lot of us are unaware of and you go into detail in the book, but it feels to me, as an observer, the government can't do this indefinitely, but companies assume that it will. Are these short term fixes for long term problems in the financial market as a whole?"", ""Bethany McLean: I think that's so well said and the theme of the book is fragility. Fragility and so many of our systems. But yes, because the Feds stepped in in such a massive way in the spring of 2020, we've all just said, great, the Fed fixed it all, it's not a problem, [laughs] but it really is because every time there's been an issue, whether it's long term capital management, then the global financial crisis, now the pandemic, the Fed has had to step in a bigger and bigger way, really stretching the limits of its power. In some ways, not legally, but in some ways exceeding the bounds of its authority in that the Fed is supposed to be the lender of last resort to the regulated banking system. We all talked a lot about the shadow banking system after the global financial crisis. The shadow banking system got many times bigger, didn't shrink. Most of the Fed's rescue in the spring of 2020 was due to problems in the shadow banking system, which supposedly the reforms after the financial crisis were going to help fix that. The problem is twofold. One is just more of an intellectual issue. Do you want the Fed having to step in, in a bigger and bigger way, in order to fix problems that are supposedly outside the Fed's purview. What does that mean about how fragile our system is? But the more existential question is, what happens if it doesn't work? What happens if the Feds can't, now that everyone expects the Fed can always fix it. What happens if the Fed can't fix it? Then what do we do?"", ""Deidre Woollard: That is a big concern. The other aspect of it too, the paycheck protection program and the PPE, like looking back on that system, certainly we had some of the scandals with large companies, taking money and then giving it back. But do you think large companies, it seems like the funnel of there was broken in terms of being able to get the money to the right places. Is that something that you see has been fixed at all? Or do you think if we end up in a similar situation, again we'll have the same problem of not knowing, it all becomes a black box. We don't know where the money's going."", ""Bethany McLean: I think it is a big problem in an economy that is so tied to the capital markets. The capital markets are just set up. It's innate in the way it's structured, that anything that benefits the capital markets is going to benefit big companies, not small companies and it's going to benefit the rich and not the poor. That's part of the subtitle of our book, who America helps, and who it leaves behind. Because if you have a massive rescue program like the Fed did, then you're going to make borrowing money really cheap for really big companies. But it doesn't do anything for the local restaurant or the small business down the block. You're going to do a lot to increase asset prices for those who own assets, which are the wealthy in our society, but that doesn't do much. In fact, if anything that's negative as inflation sets in for those at the bottom end of the socioeconomic spectrum. We have to think differently in a society where our means of monetary disbursement has been through the Fed. If that's the way it's going to be, then we have to think differently about how that plays out and what that means."", ""Deidre Woollard: Let's talk a little bit about the vaccines because, making a vaccine certainly isn't easy, not always profitable. What happened? It's pretty impressive. But looking at it, one of the things that I was really fascinated by was the different companies and how they are now. Because for like a Pfizer or Johnson and Johnson's, these are big companies and then making a big move. But Moderna, you take a company that was still in start up phase, not really having a product out there. They go from being this minor biotech to now this major player, but now they're on the other side of this. I'm watching it from an investment perspective. I'm really watching what's next for them. What did you learn about it covering it from the journalistic side?"", ""Bethany McLean: I thought the vaccines were actually an inspiring part of the story and perhaps the only one. But there was a recognition on the part of at least some government officials that namely Alexazar who was in the Bush administration and then worked at Eli Lily, and then came back to the Trump administration as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, so the private market was not going to produce a vaccine on its own, at least not on any reasonable time frame. I think that's so important because if you're a rapid believer in the free market, you tend to think the free market will fix everything. We need a vaccine. Companies are going to produce one. No, you have to understand the unique dynamics of every market to understand what may need to be done, what incentives may need to be set. What may need to be done differently. In the case of the vaccines Azar looked at and realized that pharmaceutical industries have grown to hate the vaccine business because it's not profitable. It's not highly profitable because governments are the major buyers. Because too many times they've raced to the rescue to develop vaccines, only to find out their vaccines aren't needed. They've taken a hit in the stock market. Investors have been mad, and they don't have the means to do this really quickly without government help."", ""The government got involved and said, how do we set all the preconditions to make this possible? That was operation warp speed. I think it's a huge testament to how government and the private sector can work together and also to the importance of the rules that govern a market, to really looking at them and understanding, instead of just saying, oh, the free market, we'll take care of it. For Moderna, it's really fascinating. It was a sketchy company and they ran up to the pandemic because they hyped their products a lot or their research a lot, and never produced anything. People were skeptical of them. But then they did come through with a vaccine, obviously. The question is what that means going forward. I've honestly heard both sides of the argument and I'm not sure where I come out. One side of the argument is, mRNA is the future. Now that we've figured out the manufacturing of an mRNA based product, there are so many improvements that can be made and now this opens the door to mRNA as a therapy for all these other diseases. The other argument I've heard is it's not that simple and mRNA is still a trickster. It's going to be more difficult than Moderna is saying. I'm not sure we know the answer to that yet. It's going to be really interesting to see what happens."", ""Deidre Woollard: I want to ask you a specific business related question, because at the Motley Fool, one of the things that our analysts look at is companies buying back stock. You've got this line in the book about Intel saying that, if Intel could reinvest some of the 130 billion it's spent on buybacks in two decades, it would have had a better shot of reclaiming it's former glory. Right now we're in another situation with a lot of buybacks. Do you feel like companies are making a mistake there?"", ""Bethany McLean: Sally I think it's hard. I'm going to give you a nuanced answer because it's really easy to say yes, how terrible they should be taking that money and investing in buildings. But the problem is they haven't seen anything to invest in and so part of the problem the semiconductor manufacturing is TSMC has a huge advantage they can do it much more cheaply. In a world where bottom line profits were the most important thing, of course, everybody was going to outsource more and more to TSMC and even now with the Chips Act, it's really unclear that semiconductors manufactured in America, things are going to be way more expensive. It's unclear that people are going to pay for them. I think it's not as simple as bad company who took all this money and didn't invest in the US. It's that there's been these fundamental changes in our economy such that investing in the US has not seemed like a viable option. But I think we have to look at that and understand what's going on and try to do something to address it because in the end, a country where everything we need is made somewhere else, is speaking of fragility as a pretty fragile place. But I think the underlying issues are far more complicated than buybacks are bad."", ""Deidre Woollard: Absolutely. I think the other thing about the Chips Act and building here is just one part of it. The education to make sure that we have the workers who can, [inaudible] that's a whole other category."", ""Bethany McLean: I remember talking to somebody about TSMC and hearing that in Taiwan basically, the best job you can get is go to work at TSMC. That's just amazing, that's what you aspire to and so that creates this self reinforcing loop where that's what people want to do, that's the best and the brightest. That's the best place to be and how we go back and recreate that in the US I don't know."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, last question for you. You've got this book done, I'm sure you have something else that you're working on. What are you focused on now and what big stories are capturing your imagination?"", ""Bethany McLean: I wrote a piece for a business insider about Goldman Tax and some of the turmoil there, which was really interesting, as you mentioned, that's where I started my career, so I have a tie to the place, albeit from decades ago at this point. But I'm continuing to watch all the things that we wrote about in the book, and particularly some of the ongoing ramifications of Federal Reserve Policy and what that means and the disparate regulatory regimes for regulated banks versus private equity firms and hedge funds and how that plays out for our financial system. I think that's a really interesting question going forward. What it means that vast was of the market are now under the control of private equity and private credit. If they control that much, are they really private? I think these things are really interesting questions and then some of the divides in our society, we all got fixated on that Federal Reserve survey that said the media net worth of Americans went up 37% in the pandemic, isn't that great? But that number masks median, [laughs] as any mathematician knows, is a tricky concept and that number masks a lot of problems underneath it. I think we have a lot of fundamental problems and I hope we can tackle some."", ""Dylan Lewis: Anthony McLean's work, The Big Fail is out now anywhere you find books. Coming up after the break, Ron Gross, Andy Cross, return with a couple of stocks on their radar.

I'm Dylan Lewis, joined again by Andy Cross and Ron Gross. We're getting all previews of 2024 as 2023 comes to a close. Spice maker, McCormick just dropped their flavor forecast for the upcoming year. According to the company, Tamarind is the flavor to watch in 2024. Ron, will you be using Tamarind grilling in the New Year?"", ""Ron Gross: If you're a fan of the tartaric acid in it, then it's quite a good meat tenderizer, so you could for sure use it as part of your grilling. But it's very versatile sweets, sours, savory dishes. It goes a lot of places. It gives a yellowish color to the food. There's things you can work with."", 'Dylan Lewis: I think that sounded a little gastronomical there and he was really getting into some serious lingo.', ""Ron Gross: Team gastronomical so there you go.

You're a fan of Tamarind even if you don't know it."", ""Dylan Lewis: If you're keeping score at home the flavor of the year in 2023 was a Vietnamese and cajun style seasoning.

Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Ron, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?"", ""Ron Gross: I'm looking at Target TGT it's really interesting to me. As many know, Brian Cornell has been the driving force behind Target past successes, and the current attempt to right size the business. He's been CEO since 2014. He was involved with the acquisition of Shift to boost same day deliveries. Target has definitely been struggling with their inventory mix. They were much too in big ticket items because of COVID. They didn't pivot quickly enough. There was too many discretionary items on the books. They've been working inventory out for quite some quarters now and I think it's looking like they have it somewhat under control. They had a big controversy because of Pride month. A lot of folks boycotted the stores there, I'm hoping that is largely behind them. Shrink does remain a concern as it does with most retailers, theft and other inventory losses. This quarter, a modest revenue beat the operating margins improved dramatically. They've got a 3.3% yield, 52 consecutive years of increases, trading only 14.7 times earnings versus someone like Walmart at 23 times. I think Target, if you're interested in a little bit of a turnaround, is an interesting one to look at."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Target.', ""Dan Boyd: Ron, I'm glad you said it was a turnaround play because Target, with all of its shrink problems which were mostly self inflicted and it's just litany of cheap, cheesy crap in its stores doesn't seem like a great investment to me."", 'Andy Cross: Crap being the technical term for lower price merchandise. [laughs]', ""Dylan Lewis: I think that was a comment. I don't think that was a question, just to be I clear."", 'Dan Boyd: Understood.', 'Dylan Lewis: Andy, what is on your radar?', ""Andy Cross: Changing away from the turnaround, MongoDB symbol MDB provides Cloud based, unstructured databases to thousands of clients. It has hundreds of developers every month that are joining its platform. It's a leading flexible Cloud based database, structured software out there. Retention rates very high more than 120%, clients with more than 100,000 annual billings is up 28% the last quarter. Their new search tool, Atlas Vector Search, allows developers to search this data and use it for all those large language models that are driving a lot of AI. The growth rates have been over, say, 40% for the past three years. That has now slowed like many tech companies recent growth has slowed and their guidance for the fourth quarter was 19%. Not super inspiring I think the market was hoping for a little bit better. The stock has more than doubled over the past year, so it's done very well. It's sold off in that news because of some of the so called whisper numbers. We're looking for a little bit higher growth in the fourth quarter. They are now starting to generate some free cash flow. There are adjusted margins, if you start backing out some of that stock comp, pesky stock compensation, they're starting to show profit growth there. It's a $28 billion market cap with $700 million in cash into it. The trick here is it still sees at 17 times sales. A year ago it sold at 8 times sales so much different there. Still looking at it as a watch list I don't own it, but I know a lot of Motley Fool members out there do."", 'Dylan Lewis: Man behind the glass DB a question about MongoDB.', 'Dan Boyd: When you guys hear MongoDB, do you think about Mongo from Blazing Saddles?', ""Andy Cross: 100%. Ever since this company came public that's been my thought about this."", 'Dan Boyd: Does that make you want to invest in it?', 'Andy Cross: Well, I have not and I wish I had because the stock has done very well over the last few years.', 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, which one is going on your watch list this week?', ""Dan Boyd: It's been Mongo, I guess.

Harvard President Claudine Gay will keep her position after receiving unanimous support from the university's top board, foreign affairs expert Fiona Hill raises concerns about delayed Ukraine aid, and Signet's CEO knows you're going to get engaged before you do. Have a great Wednesday! "", ""- Popping the question. Gina Drosos knows when you're going to get engaged. She's the CEO of Signet Jewelers, the $7.8 billion-in-revenue company behind jewelry brands Jared, Kay, and Zales. And when she took over as CEO six years ago, Signet made a pivot into data."", 'The company started to study couples and what leads them to get engaged. (Engagement rings and wedding bands make up half of its business). It came up with a list of 45 milestones that are part of the path to a proposal. Once a couple completes 25 to 30 of the items on the list, they are statistically significantly more likely to get engaged.', 'There are the obvious ones, like moving in together or merging finances. But Signet\'s data starts earlier in a relationship—from when couples first meet. Going to a sporting event or a concert together—or even a movie—are on the list. (A movie comes first. It\'s a ""lower cash outlay,"" Drosos explains.) Attending a wedding together, meeting friends, meeting family, acquiring a pet together, and taking a trip that\'s not for someone else\'s wedding are all milestones. There are also some less obvious ones: Paying off a chunk of debt and breaking up and getting back together can be part of the journey to an engagement. These milestones are broken up into phases.', 'Signet started studying these milestones to support its core business—engagement rings—but has found other uses for the research too. With this information, Signet can advertise not just to couples who search ""engagement rings"" online, but to couples earlier in their relationships. ""If a couple is in stage three, we might be talking to them about birthday gifts,"" Drosos says. ""If they\'re in stage four, we\'re talking to them about how much to spend on an engagement ring.""', 'Before she became the CEO of Signet (and led a turnaround following major sexual harassment cases under her predecessor), Drosos was a 25-year veteran of Procter & Gamble\'s beauty business. That\'s where she learned the power of data. ""I have a strong belief that using data to make decisions is a way to drive innovation in a company,"" she says. At Signet, she built a core data team of about 50 employees and directed hundreds more throughout the company to rely on data in their decision making.', 'Signet\'s research has proven useful this year. When the pandemic hit, the company predicted that the jewelry industry would experience a second recession in about three years. Indeed, that\'s what is happening now given the 3.25 years it takes a typical couple to get engaged and the months- or years-long pauses in dating that COVID caused for some people. ""People aren\'t getting engaged at the rate that they normally would,"" Drosos says. This year, about 2.2 million Americans got engaged, compared to 2.8 million in a typical year pre-COVID. Drosos expects that slowdown to resolve in 2024.', 'December is the company\'s biggest time of year for both gifts and engagement rings. The ten days before Christmas are when ""most people are buying that one special jewelry gift for their person,"" Drosos says.', 'Signet\'s also using its data to convince customers to buy jewelry not just for a proposal. ""Is moving in together a good gift-giving occasion?"" is a question Drosos says her team considers.

The worldwide measure of stock performance extended its winning streak for the sixth consecutive session, spurred by the S&P 500's close on Wednesday, which was just 2% shy of its all-time peak, reported Bloomberg. This positive momentum continued to propel upward during Thursday's Asian futures trading. Noteworthy milestones were achieved by Apple Inc., reaching a historic high, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, also attaining record levels. The Federal Reserve's dot plot, which serves as a visual representation of policymakers' interest rate projections, revealed a signal of potential 75 basis points in cuts over the next year. This disclosure triggered a noteworthy retreat in the value of the dollar, further influencing the positive market sentiment. As the financial landscape adapts to the evolving economic dynamics, investors have been closely monitoring the Federal Reserve's signals for insights into its policy direction. The anticipation of interest-rate cuts has not only fueled the rally in stocks but has also had a notable impact on the bond market, contributing to the overall surge in bond prices.

In November, inflation dropped to 2.4%, prompting heightened expectations for ECB rate cuts in 2024, especially after a comment from board member Isabel Schnabel. Currently, money markets project nearly 150 basis points of rate cuts for the coming year.

Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), a prominent player in the retail sector, has maintained solid in-stock conditions, contributing to its positive standing in the market. However, despite its commendable operational performance, Oppenheimer made a strategic decision to remove Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) from its mid/large cap top pick listing for 2024. The primary rationale behind this move is the firm's concerns about the valuation of Costco's stock. The financial research firm acknowledges the continued aggressive promotional efforts within the retail sector, especially in the beauty category, where retailers are actively deploying strategies to drive both foot traffic and conversion rates.

According to Wells Fargo, the narrowing range of outcomes on near-term Medicaid rates and costs is a key factor contributing to this positive adjustment. The firm suggests that if industry Medicaid margins continue to remain at elevated levels, any potential pressure may not become evident until the subsequent rate cycle. This update from Wells Fargo indicates a growing confidence in Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC) outlook, especially concerning its Medicaid-related factors.

Indeed, Managed Medicaid penetration has increased from 25% of total Medicaid spend in 2010 to 60% today, and we expect further gains over time. In Marketplace, growth is driven by the trend toward more individuals buying health insurance. Centene holds the #1 market share in both of these programs and is well positioned to capitalize on their continued growth. The stock trades for 10x consensus 2024 EPS, but this doesn’t tell the whole story. Past missteps in Centene’s Medicare business will result in that segment losing $0.80 per share next year. We believe Centene can turn Medicare around and generate positive earnings in the next few years. This could increase EPS by more than $1 per share and reduce the P/E ratio to just 8.5x.

Growing competition in this market remains a common theme. As the COVID-19 impact wanes, M&A and consolidation activities are expected to pick up in the fragmented market.', 'Medical inflation and workforce challenges are keeping the industry players under pressure. With utilization, expenses are expected to improve for the hospital companies. Companies like HCA Healthcare Inc., Universal Health Services Inc., Tenet Healthcare Corp., Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. and Community Health Systems, Inc. are expected to benefit from these developments.', 'The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care and diagnostic and emergency services.', 'Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.', 'Embracing the Digital Frontier: Hospitals are leveraging ongoing technological advancements to enhance services and drive growth. This shift optimizes operations, reduces costs, enhances convenience and elevates the overall patient experience. The adoption of telehealth and telemedicine, accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, is expected to persist in its growth trajectory. Companies are incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, coupled with real-time analytics, to deliver quality care. AI aids in refining clinical workflow management and medical diagnoses, reducing patient wait times and treatment costs.', 'Patient Volume Growth: The resurgence of deferred elective procedures in recent quarters, post-pandemic constraints, has propelled patient volumes. Nevertheless, concerns linger for patients due to medical inflation, escalating coverage costs and financial constraints, prompting delays in addressing non-emergency medical needs. The upswing in out-of-pocket costs poses a potential deterrent to patient volume growth.', ""However, mitigating factors such as the Affordable Care Act (ACA) and comparable safety nets may offer some relief in this challenging scenario. The U.S. Census Bureau's revised report indicates that rapid growth in the 65+ age group, driven by scientific and healthcare advancements, is amplifying demand for hospital services."", ""Escalating Costs: The upsurge in patient volumes, along with increased prices for hospital supplies and inflationary pressures, is projected to amplify hospitals' operating costs. While workforce challenges show signs of improvement, they persist as a concern. Companies are strategically prioritizing labor productivity enhancements and the integration of new technologies to optimize expenditure. Additionally, leveraging contract renegotiations with suppliers and vendors is identified as a potential catalyst for cost management and operational efficiency."", ""Resurgence in M&A: Merger-and-acquisition (M&A) activity in hospitals and health systems, having sharply declined during the COVID-19 pandemic, is now witnessing a robust rebound. The fragmented industry is expected to see several deals in the upcoming days.

The cost savings generated by these restructuring initiatives will act as a tailwind for the company. PPG Industries has undertaken extensive restructuring efforts to reduce its cost structure, primarily focusing on regions and end markets with weak business conditions. The company achieved $15 million in incremental cost reductions through restructuring programs and acquisition synergies in the third quarter of 2023 and expects incremental savings of around $15 million in the fourth quarter.PPG Industries is also raising selling prices across its business segments to offset the impact of raw material and other cost inflation and drive profitability. Significant progress has been made in increasing consolidated segment margins, which were about 15% in the third quarter of 2023, an increase of 260 basis points compared to the same quarter in 2022, aided by strong selling price realization. Pricing measures are likely to continue to support its margins in the fourth quarter.The company is also undertaking measures to grow business inorganically through value-creating acquisitions. Contributions from the acquisitions are expected to get reflected in its performance. Acquisitions, including Tikkurila, Worwag and Cetelon, are likely to contribute to its top line.PPG Industries also remains committed to boost shareholder returns with cash deployment. It has an impressive record of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. The company, in July 2023, raised its quarterly dividend by around 5% to 65 cents per share.

', 'Emerson, a British citizen born in Argentina and based in New York, joined Goldman as an analyst in 1999, steadily climbing the ranks over the years. The commodities unit, where he worked, has been a key part of the investment bank’s business following its acquisition of J. Aron & Co. in 1981.', '“He played a critical role in advancing the firm’s oil business,” wrote Ashok Varadhan, Dan Dees, and Jim Esposito, who lead Goldman’s global banking and markets operations.', 'Under Emerson’s leadership in recent years, the commodities trading division navigated volatilities from the COVID-19 pandemic to the Ukraine war, during which energy prices wavered dramatically.', 'The division has a record of past leaders who went on to hold influential roles higher up in the company; former CEO Lloyd Blankfein is one example, Bloomberg reported.', 'Although Emerson will retire from his role in trading, he will continue to stay at the company as an advisor during the transition, a Goldman spokesperson confirmed to Fortune. He will be succeeded by two of his deputies, Qin Xiao and Nitin Jindal, who will co-lead the business.', 'CEO Solomon’s leadership style and business decisions have come under scrutiny within and outside the company. His efforts foraying into commercial banking were unsuccessful, and he undertook several other restructuring plans across Goldman’s business. Adding to internal friction, news leaked that the bank planned to cut bonuses paid to bankers for 2022 by at least 40%, the Financial Times reported last December.', 'Emerson was among Solomon’s critics given his misstep with trying to pivot to consumer banking, according to Bloomberg.', 'The global commodities chief saw revenues for his desk surge to over $3 billion last year, thanks to high oil and gas prices. The previous two years also saw similar highs in his division’s revenues, which helped Emerson pocket $100 million since 2020.', 'Outside work, he’s earned a reputation for his practical jokes: On a trip to Costa Rica, he threw fake snakes around the house to scare the group he was traveling with, according to Bloomberg.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

CEO David Solomon, by comparison, took in $77.5 million over the same time frame, the wire service reported.', 'Xiao Qin and Nitin Jindal will become co-heads of Goldman’s commodities operation in Emerson’s stead, according to a separate memo seen by Reuters.

Solomon’s predecessor as CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, had a background in commodities, as did Waldron’s predecessor as president, Gary Cohn.', 'But the business has also seen its share of volatility over the past six or seven years. The unit notched a low of $300 million in revenue in 2017, the New York Post reported.

Goldman’s commodities business saw windfalls of around $2 billion in 2020 and 2021, and revenue spiked above $3 billion last year, according to Bloomberg. That figure, though, is down significantly over the first nine months of 2023, Goldman filings show.', 'For his team’s efforts in 2021, Emerson received a $30 million bonus last year, the New York Post reported.', 'Emerson’s departure stands as another reminder of the talent drain Goldman has seen over the past few months, as several executives who’ve logged more than 20 years with the firm have left. That roster includes Julian Salisbury, Goldman’s onetime global co-head of asset management, who left in July to become co-chief investment officer at Sixth Street Partners. Luke Sarsfield, a 23-year Goldman veteran and fellow global co-head of asset management, left the firm in April and later became CEO of Dallas-based asset manager P10. And John Rogers, Goldman’s chief of staff, who joined the firm in 1994, left in August.', 'As for Emerson’s successors, one has a background in oil, like his predecessor. Qin runs trading for oil and refined products worldwide at Goldman, and also leads commodities trading in Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia Pacific. He became a managing director in 2010 and partner in 2016, according to Reuters.', 'Jindal manages commodities trading in the Americas and natural gas and power trading in North America.

Even the OPEC+ announcement of nearly 2 million barrels per day of additional production cuts was unable to shore up oil prices as the market looked for stronger commitments.Meanwhile, natural gas slumped to a three-and-a-half-month low, overwhelmed by high production and insipid weather-related demand.', ""1. Houston, TX-based energy company Occidental Petroleum has entered into a purchase agreement to acquire Midland-based oil and gas producer CrownRock L.P. The buyout will take place in a cash and stock deal worth approximately $12 billion, including the assumption of CrownRock’s outstanding debt.Occidental plans to fund the acquisition by taking on $9.1 billion in new debt, issuing about $1.7 billion in common stock and taking over CrownRock's $1.2 billion in outstanding debt. With the fulfillment of normal closing requirements and the acquisition of regulatory clearances, the deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024.This agreement enhances Occidental’s premier Permian portfolio with the addition of 170,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (Mboed) of high-margin, lower-decline unconventional production and about 1,700 undeveloped sites in 2024. On a diluted share basis, higher free cash flow is anticipated, with $1 billion in the first year based on $70 per barrel WTI. (Occidental to Buy CrownRock in a $12B Cash & Stock Deal)2. U.S. supermajor ExxonMobil expects a substantial rise in its earnings potential through 2027, with upstream earnings projected to more than double from the 2019 reported level. The outlook is underpinned by robust production growth in the Permian Basin and Guyana.XOM mentioned that effective implementation of its strategic initiatives since 2019 enhanced its earnings capacity, contributing about $10 billion to its annual earnings and cash flow at a real Brent price of $60 per barrel. The company is progressing toward achieving an additional $14 billion in earnings and cash flow growth potential over the next four years.The company predicts a production increase to 3.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (Boe/d) in 2024, up from this year’s 3.7 million Boe/d, as it places its confidence in growth from the Permian shale basin and Guyana. OM indicated that it anticipates maintaining a flat production until the end of this year, standing at 3.7 million Boe/d primarily due to its withdrawal from Russia. (ExxonMobil Expects Raised Earnings & Oil Production)3. Small rival Chevron recently outlined its planned capital expenditure for 2024, focusing on strategic investments in both traditional and new energy sectors. The company expects to spend between $15.5 billion and $16.5 billion on capital projects for its consolidated subsidiaries, with an additional $3 billion allocated for affiliate ventures. This announcement not only signifies a financial plan but also serves as a roadmap for Chevron's commitment to sustainable growth and innovation.Chevron's upstream spending for 2024 is poised at an impressive $14 billion, with a significant allocation to the United States. Approximately $6.5 billion is reserved for the development of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s U.S. shale and tight portfolio. Within this, a noteworthy $5 billion is dedicated to the Permian Basin development, showcasing Chevron's commitment to harnessing the potential of this prolific resource.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.A substantial 25% of U.S. upstream Capex is reserved for projects in the Gulf of Mexico. Among these, the Anchor project stands out with an objective to achieve its first oil in 2024. Chevron's strategic investments in this region underscore its dedication to diversification and tapping into diverse energy sources. (Chevron Raises 2024 Capex, Eyes Lower Carbon Future)4.\xa0\xa0 Phillips 66 disclosed a 2024 capital budget of $2.2 billion, with $923 million allocated to sustaining capital and $1.3 billion for growth capital. The figure is lower than the downstream operator’s projected capital spending for 2023, which is estimated at $2.5 billion. The budget aligns with PSX’s strategic goal of returning $13-$15 billion to shareholders by the end of 2024.The sustaining capital budget incorporates $300 million in efficiencies achieved through the company’s business transformation initiatives. Before the business transformation, Phillips 66 historically spent an average of $1 billion per year on sustaining capital. With the inclusion of DCP Midstream consolidation, an additional $200 million in sustaining capital is accounted for.Phillips 66 intends to allocate $1.1 billion in Refining, with $412 million allocated for sustaining capital. The Refining growth capital of $654 million encompasses the completion of the San Francisco Refinery conversion in Rodeo, transforming it into one of the world’s largest renewable fuels facilities. The capital budget includes initiatives aimed at enhancing the refining performance. (Phillips 66 Announces $2.2B Capital Expenditure for 2024).5.\xa0\xa0 Chevron and Hess disclosed that they have received a request for additional information from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) concerning the former’s planned $53 billion deal to acquire the upstream explorer. This disclosure, found in an 8-K filing, underscores the heightened regulatory scrutiny surrounding major business transactions.The companies have pledged to respond promptly to the second request, emphasizing their commitment to working cooperatively with the FTC throughout the review process. It's worth noting that the Hart-Scott-Rodino waiting period is now extended until 30 days after both CVX and HES have substantially complied with this additional request.As CVX and HES navigate the intricate web of regulatory requirements, transparency and cooperation with the FTC emerge as the cornerstones of a successful merger. The companies are positioned to demonstrate not only the strategic benefits of the deal but also their commitment to adhering to antitrust regulations and fostering a competitive marketplace.

Retailers have had to adjust, opening their own online stores to be where customers are shopping -- offering a so-called omnichannel experience. TJX Companies (NYSE: TJX) is no different from other retailers in this regard.', ""But the discount retailer just made clear that all stores don't belong online."", ""When Amazon came onto the scene as an upstart online bookseller, the normal way for consumers to get books was to browse through a physical bookstore. Buying a book online was easier and less expensive and could be done from home. Many small booksellers (and even some large ones) were eventually forced out of business. Even bookstore giant Barnes & Noble ended up resetting its business. Although the impact on other retailer sectors hasn't been quite as dramatic, the advent of online shopping has radically changed the retail picture. It's now almost mandatory to talk about being an omnichannel retailer."", ""That explains why TJX operates the T.J. Maxx, Marshalls, Homegoods, Sierra, and Homesense brands and tjmaxx.com, marshalls.com, and sierra.com. Essentially, it's attempting to meet its customers where they shop, whether that be in a store or from home on the internet. It's the only way to compete over the long term, even if the company's physical stores are the main top-line driver. And investors simply expect online to be part of the story for most retailers today."", ""But there's something missing from that list of online stores. Homesense and Homegoods don't have online components. In fact, the company just shut down its Homegoods online business. There was a notable impact from that decision, as the company reported that it lowered earnings by $0.03 per share in the third quarter of 2023. Earnings in the period totaled $1.03 per share, so the hit was roughly 3%. That's not huge, but it isn't insignificant, either."", ""During the retailer's third-quarter conference call, it was clear that online sales are a small part of the overall TJX business. The company was also pretty specific about the potential for the Homegoods.com operation. Essentially, management didn't think it could ever turn the online version of the store profitable. At that point, it was a pretty simple decision, since throwing good money after bad is a terrible investment choice."", 'The problem boils down to the store\'s business model. Many of the things Homegoods sells are large and not necessarily easy to get a sense of online from a few pictures. But there are other online retailers that sell large items, like furniture, with reasonable success. The key for Homegoods is what might be called the ""thrill of the hunt."" Essentially, going to a Homegoods store is kind of like exploring for a hidden treasure. It\'s hard to replicate that experience online in the same way with the items it sells.', ""Given the modest size of the online business at TJX, investors probably shouldn't be too worried about the shutdown of Homegoods.com. In fact, the contrary view is probably more appropriate. Investors should be happy to see the management team make the hard call to shut down an online business that just wasn't working so it could focus more of its attention on businesses that are working -- like physical Homegoods stores."", ""In the third quarter, TJX's overall same-store sales rose a strong 6%. But sales at Homegoods were up 9%, meaning it's outperforming relative to other nameplates the company owns. And that improvement was entirely driven by an increase in traffic, which means more people are choosing to shop at the store. When you see that, management should probably be applauded for pulling the plug on the money-losing online version of the store."", ""To be fair, there's a trend in the retail sector right now that plays right into TJX's strongest attributes. Consumers are increasingly looking for ways to save money, and shopping at the off-price retailer's stores is a great way to do that. So there's an outside tailwind helping Homegoods' same-store sales. But that trend obviously wasn't benefiting the online version of the store enough to make it profitable to run. If you own TJX, the pruning of a less desirable business isn't a problem; it's a sign of a strong management team."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in TJX right now?', 'Before you buy stock in TJX, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and TJX Companies wasn't one of them.

This results in the formation of a cytolytic synapse with lysis of the cancer cell.12,13 DLL3 represents an exciting therapeutic target for patients with SCLC, as approximately 85% to 96% of patients have expression of DLL3 on the cell surface of SCLC cells, with minimal expression in normal cells.6,14-16"", ""About Tarlatamab Clinical TrialsAmgen's robust tarlatamab development program includes the DeLLphi clinical trials, which evaluate tarlatamab as a monotherapy and as part of combination regimens in earlier stages of SCLC, and DeLLpro clinical trials, which evaluate tarlatamab in neuroendocrine prostate cancer."", 'In the Phase 1 DeLLphi-300 study, tarlatamab showed responses in 23.4% of patients with encouraging durability in heavily pre-treated patients with SCLC. In the Phase 2 DeLLphi-301 study, tarlatamab administered as 10 mg dose every two weeks demonstrated an objective response rate of 40% in patients with advanced SCLC who had failed two or more prior lines of treatment. In both DeLLphi-300 and DeLLphi-301, the most frequent treatment-related adverse events were cytokine release syndrome (CRS; 52-55%), pyrexia (31-37%), and dysgeusia (22-26%), which were primarily grade 1-2.

The collapse of the deal is the latest example of how the pharmaceutical industry is battling the US government on a number of fronts, including the White House's move to license drugs that were developed with federal funding, the FTC's scrutiny of deals, and the Medicare drug pricing talks."", 'The announcement by the Biden Administration to license drugs is an attempt to reduce the cost of certain drugs in the US.', 'The ""march-in rights"" as they are known, established by the 1980 Bayh-Dole Act, allows the government to exercise intellectual property rights on patents developed with the use of federal funds or by the government. The most recent example of such government research being used in a commercial product is the work from the NIH that eventually lead to the Moderna (MRNA) COVID-19 vaccine — which Moderna eventually paid the government rights for, after it lost a legal battle.', 'Robin Feldman, a professor and director of the Center for Innovation at UC Law San Francisco, said ""the government is flexing muscles that it has rarely flexed in the past.""', 'Rutgers Law School professor Michael Carrier said if the government is able to march in, ""This is a shot that would be heard around the world. The US is the country in the world where pharma perhaps cares the most about protecting its IP rights; in many cases it\'s the largest market.""', ""A key reason of concern: This is the first time ever the government has used increasing drug costs as a reason to trigger march-in rights. That's a significant change from the stance of prior administrations."", ""And as expected, the industry trade group, PhRMA, isn't thrilled."", '""If government bureaucrats are allowed to take away patent protections at any time, there is no incentive for biopharmaceutical manufacturers to collaborate with the government or universities, returning us to the pre-Bayh-Dole era where promising new technologies sat on the shelf benefitting no one,"" the organization said in a statement.', 'Globally, though, the White House announcement was welcome news.', 'Shortly after a request for comment from Yahoo Finance, World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X that he welcomed the announcement, and that governments should use all legal tools to promote broader access to medicines.', ""The FTC's track record on pharma deals isn't great. It previously tried, unsuccessfully, to block Amgen’s (AMGN) $28 billion acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics. It asked for more details and more closely scrutinized Pfizer’s (PFE) $43 billion acquisition of Seagen, ultimately allowing the deal to go through. (Pfizer received approval this week and will close the deal Thursday.)"", '""Ultimately, [Khan] is losing all those cases. They’re not actually doing something that changes the nature of the industry,"" said Craig Garthwaite, director of healthcare at Northwestern University Kellogg School of Management.', 'The FTC, however, sees it differently, and counts the Amgen case as a win.', '""The FTC’s settlement on the Amgen Horizon deal has extensive, binding agreements on all of the concerns we raised in the complaint we filed in court. This agreement is a legal victory for the FTC, but an even bigger win for Americans who need access to affordable medicine,"" said FTC spokesperson Douglas Farrar in a statement to Yahoo Finance.', ""And the end of the Sanofi/Maze deal validates the FTC's strategy: putting the spotlight on the acquisition of smaller, earlier-stage companies by Big Pharma — a longtime growth strategy in the industry."", ""Smaller firms are nimble and can conduct early-stage research that isn't weighed down by a large company bureaucracy. These companies provide larger firms the opportunity to to bolster pipelines. Pfizer, for example, has acquired three companies in the past year, including Seagen, to help fill a $17 billion loss expected by patent expirations by 2030."", ""Critics contend that such deals show that Big Pharma doesn't do much R&D, and therefore shouldn’t be charging high prices on drugs."", 'But, Garthwaite said, ""The infrastructure to actually take a drug from Phase 2 to Phase 3 ... run the clinical trial well ... is an exceptionally expensive fixed cost structure. We don\'t want 40 firms to spend that money.""', 'Medicare', 'Medicare officials have targeted 10 drugs\xa0that they will start price negotiations for in the coming year. There are already concerns about the impact on the bottom line.', 'Analysts were largely not surprised by the first drugs targeted — as evdienced by the lack of stock movement the day of the announcement. The industry is waiting to undergo negotiations, and investors are waiting to see how much of a price cut the government eventually demands.', 'Companies have pushed back with nearly a dozen lawsuits, claiming that the process is unconstitutional.', 'In response to the drug pricing negotiations, companies have already said they are reconsidering deals that could land them on the target list, and anticipating which blockbusters could land on future lists.', 'For example, Novo Nordisk (NVO), which found itself surprisingly on the list for one of its insulin products, is also weighing the potential if its weight loss and diabetes drugs, Wegovy and Ozempic, end up a target of Medicare.', 'UC Law\'s Feldman says that all these government actions ""send a message to the pharmaceutical industry: Get your house in order, or we will make things very difficult for you.""', ""But the long-term odds of success on these three fronts aren't great, experts told Yahoo Finance."", 'Garthwaite said that policymakers are being short-sighted in their efforts, and called the Biden administration\'s efforts ""crass.""', '""The real lack of access is if the product doesn’t exist.

In a watershed moment for genomic medicine, CRISPR and partner Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX) secured the first approval ever from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited product earlier this month. The therapy, known as Casgevy, is indicated for patients with sickle cell disease.', ""Despite this landmark approval and its potential as a future blockbuster, CRISPR's shares are highly likely to be on the volatile side during the early years of Casgevy's commercial launch. After all, the therapy will likely require Vertex and CRISPR to invest in patient and prescriber education initiatives, and these programs will probably take time to bear fruit. However, this genomic medicine pioneer seems to be walking a nearly identical path as fellow trailblazer Amgen, which bodes well for the long-term performance of its shares."", ""What's next for the biotech? With its first approval in hand, CRISPR can now focus on accelerating the development of its other pipeline candidates, establishing new partnerships and deepening already established ones, and consider taking bigger clinical risks in high-value settings such as chronic diseases."", ""Keeping with this theme, the company recently decided to pivot to earlier assets in immuno-oncology to chase a potentially superior clinical profile. Even though this move likely pushed back its commercial debut in cancer by a few years, it's a smart strategy that speaks volumes about management's confidence in the company's platform."", ""Lastly, the biotech should have plenty of firepower for bolt-on acquisitions as Casgevy's launch ramps. This is an important potential bonus from being the first to market. In effect, CRISPR will likely become cash flow positive before any of its rivals, giving it fuel for value-creating M&A."", 'CRISPR screens as a potential long-term winner in the genomic medicine space, and investors who can tolerate short-term volatility should be rewarded handsomely for holding this stock over the next decade or longer.

Picking the best stocks for the new year isn’t about making predictions, but it’s about choosing high-quality companies with growth prospects and good value for shareholders.', 'Furthermore, it’s important to pick stocks for 2024 from a variety of market sectors. That way, investors can diversify their portfolios and avoid overdependence on one type of stock. So, let’s take a closer look at four picks for potentially powerful returns over the next 12 months — Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Macy’s (NYSE:M), NIO (NYSE:NIO), and Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW).', 'News flash — you’re not required to have a “Magnificent Seven” stock in your portfolio next year. Yet, it’s not a terrible idea to have at least one large-cap technology stock. I’m choosing Advanced Micro Devices, commonly abbreviated as AMD, because the company is aggressively pursuing the latest and greatest in artificial intelligence (AI) processor technology.', 'Not long ago, AMD\xa0showcased its AI-powered hardware solutions\xa0at Advancing AI, a tech-industry event. AMD CEO Lisa Su highlighted the company’s AI-compatible MI300 processors, saying, “We are seeing very strong demand for our new Instinct MI300 GPUs, which are the highest-performance accelerators in the world for generative AI.”', 'Furthermore, AMD’s management expects the company to generate over $2 billion in revenue next year just from the MI300 processor lineup. Therefore, investors should think about adding some AMD stock to capture potential gains from the AI hardware market.', 'On TipRanks, AMD is a Moderate Buy based on\xa025 Buys and nine Hold ratings in the past three months. Nonetheless, the average Advanced Micro Devices stock price target is $130.53, implying 5.8% downside potential.', 'Strong Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales figures demonstrated that the U.S. consumer is surprisingly resilient despite persistent inflation. Amid this bullish backdrop, beaten-down Macy’s stock appears to be making a comeback.', 'The positive momentum for Macy’s could continue in 2024, as the retailer has an excellent track record of beating analysts’ quarterly earnings forecasts. Besides, even after yesterday’s nearly 20% rally in M stock, Macy’s still has a trailing P/E ratio of 7.7x, which is well below the sector median of 17.2x.', 'Best of all, Macy’s received a $5.8 billion buyout offer from a pair of financial firms. If Macy’s gets a lifeline in the form of a buyout, the retailer could go from an apparent zero to a hero in 2024.', 'M stock is a Moderate Buy, based on\xa0five Buys,\xa0seven Holds, and\xa0one Sell rating in the past three months. The average Macy’s stock price target is $15.27, implying 17.7% upside potential.', 'The last thing any forward-looking investor should want to do is skip out on the electric vehicle (EV) revolution in 2024. Consequently, you’ll probably want to pick at least one EV manufacturing stock, and my choice is NIO stock.', 'As we’ll see in a moment, analysts generally expect NIO stock to move higher over the next 12 months. Most likely, analysts are bullish because NIO’s vehicle sales are growing rapidly.', 'The company’s numbers will amaze you. Believe it or not, NIO’s vehicle deliveries rose 75.4% year-over-year and 135.7% quarter-over-quarter in Q3 2023. Moreover, the company’s EV deliveries increased 12.6% year-over-year in November — not jaw-dropping, but not too bad. Thus, investors should try to think globally, and not just locally, and consider putting NIO stock on their watch lists.', 'According to TipRanks’ analyst rating consensus, NIO is a Moderate Buy based on\xa0six Buys and three Hold ratings. The average NIO stock price target is $11.36, implying 58% upside potential.', 'I haven’t forgotten about all the passive-income investors out there. Are you looking for a great dividend stock for 2024? Then check out Charles Schwab, commonly referred to as Schwab. The company has a dividend yield of 1.61%. Plus, it has grown its dividend payments at a compound annual growth rate of 16.8% over the past five years, so don’t be surprised if Schwab continues its dividend-growth pattern in the coming year.', 'Don’t just buy SCHW stock for the dividend, though. What matters the most is Schwab’s comeback story. Do you remember the banking scare from March and April? Schwab survived the “cash sorting” and bank run headlines, stayed profitable, and has posted nothing but quarterly earnings beats in 2023 so far.', 'Additionally, Barclays (NYSE:BCS) analyst\xa0Benjamin Budish recently reiterated his Buy rating on SCHW stock along with a price target of\xa0$66. Budish feels that fears about continuous cash outflows are subsiding — a point that I fully agree with. The market expects interest-rate cuts to happen next year, and this should encourage borrowing and lending activity. All of this, if it goes according to plan, could significantly support Schwab’s financials in 2024.', 'On TipRanks, SCHW stock comes in as a Moderate Buy based on\xa013 Buys,\xa0two Holds, and\xa0two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average Charles Schwab stock price target is $68.50, implying 5.13% upside potential.', 'As an investor, you can hedge your bets while still targeting growth in 2024. The idea is to choose a diversified set of prime businesses, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Macy’s, NIO, and Charles Schwab. By considering share positions in these and other well-researched businesses, you can hopefully enjoy a solid year of gains in your portfolio.', 'Disclosure']"

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. Just take a look at General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD), which is up 67%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 15% (not including dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 5.2% in the last year , including dividends ."", ""So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress."", ' See our latest analysis for General Dynamics ', ""To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time."", 'During three years of share price growth, General Dynamics achieved compound earnings per share growth of 3.1% per year. In comparison, the 19% per year gain in the share price outpaces the EPS growth. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.', 'The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).', ""We consider it positive that insiders have made significant purchases in the last year. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on General Dynamics' earnings, revenue and cash flow."", 'It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for General Dynamics the TSR over the last 3 years was 79%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!', 'General Dynamics provided a TSR of 5.2% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. On the bright side, the longer term returns (running at about 13% a year, over half a decade) look better. Maybe the share price is just taking a breather while the business executes on its growth strategy.

Going into 2024, numerous Wall Street pros still expect strong gains from some of the industry’s stronger plays — like RCL, MGM, and WYNN — as they look to continue meeting much of the pent-up demand built during the early days of lockdown.', 'Therefore, let’s check out TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to see how the following leisure plays stack up in the face of turbulent economic conditions.', 'It’s been an incredible 2023 for shares of Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, which have more than doubled, surging around 147% year-to-date on the back of strengthening demand. Management seems incredibly upbeat following its latest third-quarter beat (adjusted earnings per share of $3.85 coming ahead of estimates), as it hiked its full-year profit guidance.', 'Numerous analysts continue to view the stock favorably, and I think they’re right to do so as bookings demand continues to heat up into the new year despite the macro headwinds.', 'Undoubtedly, robust bookings in the face of a challenged consumer environment may seem quite confusing. Indeed, we may very well be witnessing many consumers looking to meet pent-up demand built during the pandemic lockdown days. Going into the new year, I don’t expect recent bookings strength to cool off, especially if rates fall and consumer confidence gets a bit of a jolt.', 'As demand looks to heat up in 2024, I’d look for the firm to make the most of the upswing by pulling the curtain on new cruise ships. Doing so could give demand an additional shot in the arm. Who wouldn’t be excited to board a brand-new ship with all the amenities?', 'Oppenheimer analyst Ari Wald is upbeat on RCL stock, going as far as to name it one of his best picks to play the space. Many share Wald’s bullishness, with 80% of analysts covering the stock recommending RCL stock as a Buy. I’m inclined to agree with Wald and am staying bullish going into 2024.', 'Royal Caribbean stock comes in as a Strong Buy, with eight Buys and two Holds assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average RCL stock price target of $122.67 entails 2% upside potential.', 'Year-to-date, MGM stock has been a hot performer, now up 30% over the timespan. The casino and hotel firm has come a long way since the dark days of COVID-19 lockdowns. And it doesn’t look like the firm is about to slow the pace of its recovery just because the macro outlook is uncertain in the new year.', 'The casino gaming heavyweight is roaring loudly for investors, with record revenues coming out of Las Vegas. After the latest bounce, I’m inclined to stay bullish while shares continue trading at a discount relative to the peer group. At writing, MGM stock goes for 14.6 times trailing price-to-earnings, well below the resorts & casinos industry average of 24.3 times.', 'With momentum also building in its digital gaming business (BetMGM), the stock seems like one of the most intriguing long-term plays in the leisure space. BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt is aware of the stakes (forgive the pun) in the digital gaming arena, and he’s ready to position the firm to remain a worthy rival.', 'My takeaway? Don’t bet against Greenblatt and company as BetMGM looks to gain ground in the new year. At this pace, even a mild landing for the economy may not be enough to drag MGM stock back in the gutter as Vegas and Macau look to flex their muscles in the new year.', 'MGM stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 12 Buys and one Hold rating assigned in the past three months. The average MGM stock price target of $55.25 implies 27.4% upside potential.', 'Wynn Resorts is another casino play that may be overly discounted by Mr. Market at this juncture. The stock has been on the retreat again, now erasing almost all of the year-to-date gains enjoyed in the first quarter of 2023. Despite clocking in a decent recent quarter, investors seem jittery over the softness in its Wynn Macau business.', 'Add wage hikes for the Culinary Workers and Bartenders Union into the equation, and it’s not a mystery as to why the stock has been tough sledding for most of the year. Personally, I believe the recent pessimism is overblown, and I am staying bullish on the stock, just like many analysts covering the name.', 'Despite the rough past quarter, the stock remains attractively valued at just 17.8 times forward price-to-earnings, which is in line with the resorts & casinos industry average of 17.33. As the Macau region recovers further, I do view Wynn shares as a worthy way to play China’s economic rebound.', 'Wynn stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with eight Buys and two Holds given in the past three months. The average WYNN stock price target of $119.17 implies 38.2% upside potential.', 'Leisure stocks continue to win over the confidence of Wall Street analysts. From cruises to casinos, the demand recovery is hard to look past as we move into a new year that may see lower rates and a somewhat more confident consumer.', 'Going into 2024, analysts expect the greatest upside potential (~38%) to be had from WYNN stock. With its large Macau exposure, WYNN definitely seems like the riskiest of the group. That said, higher risk tends to accompany higher rewards.', 'Disclosure']"

However, prior to this announcement, Zoetis' dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. This means that most of what the business earns is being used to help it grow."", 'The next year is set to see EPS grow by 32.9%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 28%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', ""The company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $0.26 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $1.73. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 21% a year over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time."", 'Investors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. We are encouraged to see that Zoetis has grown earnings per share at 16% per year over the past five years. Zoetis definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.', 'Overall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.', ""It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company.

After holding up surprisingly well during the 2022 bear market, the utility sector has been Wall Street's worst performer in 2023, as of Dec. 1."", ""Most investors flock to utility stocks for their dividends and low volatility. Consumption habits for electricity, water, and natural gas don't change much from one year to the next. This often leads to highly predictable operating cash flow and the ability for utility stocks to pass along market-topping yields."", 'However, rapidly rising interest rates have created the perfect storm for this traditional safe haven. With Treasury yields soaring to around 5%, investors have been able to pile into longer-term bonds and short-term Treasury bills to net an equal or greater return than most utility stocks -- but with far less risk.', 'The good news for utility stocks is that Federal Reserve rate cuts are back on the table for 2024. As a result, Treasury yields have been retreating. The lower Treasury yields go, the more attractive this safe-haven sector becomes.', 'As we steam toward a new year, two utility stocks stand out as truly phenomenal buys, while another high-profile utility stock is best avoided.', ""Among the more than 100 publicly traded utilities to choose from, the one that stands out as nothing short of a screaming buy for 2024 is electric utility NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE). NextEra is the sector's largest utility by market cap ($122 billion)."", ""In addition to being weighed down by higher bond yields, NextEra's stock took a big hit in late September and early October when NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP) slashed its dividend-growth guidance to a range of 5% to 8% through 2026 from an expected double-digit annual growth rate. Parent NextEra Energy orchestrates a number of drop-down transactions to NextEra Energy Partners, and this had investors clearly concerned that NextEra Energy's future growth may be impacted. Thankfully, NextEra Energy's third-quarter operating results and outlook put those rumors to bed."", 'What separates NextEra Energy from a veritable sea of electric utility stocks is its focus on renewable energy. Out of the 70 gigawatts (GW) of capacity NextEra had in operation as of Sept. 30, 34 GW were devoted to renewable energy. This includes 23 GW of wind capacity and 6 GW of solar capacity, both of which are high-water marks globally for any electric utility.', ""Investing in green-energy projects is undeniably costly. But the good news for NextEra Energy is that it's paying dividends. The company's electricity generation costs are considerably lower than its peers, which has led to a compound adjusted earnings-per-share growth rate of 9.8% since 2012. By comparison, most electric utilities grow their bottom lines by a low-single-digit percentage."", 'NextEra has no plans to slow down its green energy push, either. Between the start of 2023 and the end of 2026, an expected 32.7 GW to 41.8 GW of renewable energy is expected to be put into operation.', ""With NextEra Energy stock having its worst year in well over a decade, its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio has fallen to 17.5. This marks the cheapest it's traded to forward-year earnings since 2015 and makes NextEra shares a phenomenal buy."", 'A second utility stock that investors can confidently buy hand over fist in the new year is water utility York Water (NASDAQ: YORW). As you\'re about to see, this under-the-radar water and wastewater utility provider is ""Wall Street\'s Greatest Dividend Stock.""', ""Unlike NextEra Energy, which was dragged lower by the poor performance of NextEra Energy Partners, there aren't any operating red flags for York. The poor performance of its shares in 2023 seems to be solely the result of Treasury bonds offering investors a potentially safer way to generate income. Further, York Water's 2.2% yield is only marginally higher than the yield of the benchmark S&P 500."", ""But this dividend is what makes York so special. The company has paid a continuous dividend to its shareholders since its founding in 1816. That's 207 consecutive years -- six decades longer than any other public company in the United States. That's how rock-solid York Water is from a payout standpoint."", 'The consistency of York\'s dividend is a function of it being a regulated water and wastewater utility for 54 municipalities in South-Central Pennsylvania. By ""regulated,"" I mean the company is unable to pass along rate hikes to its customers without the state approval of a public utility commission (in this case, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, or PPUC). Being regulated ensures that York avoids wholesale pricing, which makes its operating cash flow highly predictable.', ""To speak further on this point, York Water was given the OK in January 2023 by the PPUC to increase rates on approximately 75,000 of its customers. This rate hike is in response to $176 million in ongoing and future infrastructure upgrades. This increase is adding $13.5 million in revenue to the company's top line in 2023, which is a roughly 22% improvement from last year."", ""York's ability to make earnings-accretive acquisitions shouldn't be overlooked, either. Given that utilities typically operate as monopolies or duopolies in the areas they service, homeowners and renters rarely have a choice when it comes to which company handles their services. A steady diet of bolt-on acquisitions has worked well for York Water."", ""Although the utility sector is typically a safe place to put your money to work, there's always the potential for downside. The one utility stock investors would be wise to avoid like the plague in 2024 is Hawaiian Electric Industries (NYSE: HE)."", ""If there's one factor working in Hawaiian Electric's favor, it's that the company remains profitable on an adjusted basis. In fact, the $0.56-per-share profit reported during the September-ended quarter topped Wall Street's consensus by 4%. But that's about the only positive to bring to the table for Hawaiian Electric, which is attempting to navigate its way through a challenging situation."", ""The company's financial concerns stem from the tragic Lahaina wildfire that swept through Maui in mid-August, resulting in the deaths of 100 people. Dozens of outstanding lawsuits claim that Hawaiian Electric's equipment caused and/or failed to mitigate the deadly wildfire."", ""For its part, Hawaiian Electric is contributing $75 million out of the more than $150 million set aside for the One Ohana Initiative. This is a fund designed to help those who lost a loved one in the tragic wildfire, as well as people who were severely injured. But keep in mind that the One Ohana Initiative doesn't resolve the dozens of outstanding lawsuits against the company."", 'How much could it be on the hook for? Hawaiian Electric has $165 million in annual general liability insurance, according to filings with state regulators. But based on estimates from Capstone, the company is facing up to $4.9 billion in potential claims.', 'To make matters worse, Hawaiian Electric Industries will delay filing its financial statements. The multitude of lawsuits the company is facing, coupled with the aforementioned payout to the One Ohana Initiative, creates a mountain of financial uncertainty. This comes atop the company suspending its quarterly dividend shortly after the Lahaina fire.', ""The point is that Hawaiian Electric's future as a solvent business may be in doubt. Though it could be an incredible value, given its history of profitability and the infrastructure it already has in place, the dozens of lawsuits the company is facing may be a multiyear overhang. There's simply no reason for investors to take a big risk on Hawaiian Electric in 2024 when the sector is filled with time-tested, profitable, dividend-paying companies."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and NextEra Energy wasn't one of them.

According to Our World in Data, the global average population density in 2023 stands at 62 people per km², with considerable variation across different regions. Islands, in particular, often exhibit higher population densities compared to their geographic sizes. Notable islands with high populations include Migingo Island in Lake Victoria, East Africa, which is also the most densely populated island in Africa. Furthermore, Santa Cruz del Islote, a tiny island on the Caribbean coast of Colombia, is reported by the BBC to house five hundred people in 115 houses, occupying an area the size of a soccer field.

In 2019, 27 out of 44 countries dependent on travel and tourism for over 15% of their total share of employment were islands. While tourism offers economic benefits, it also presents adverse implications for already fragile island ecosystems and influences the social structure of these islands.

The smart, relatively safe play is to borrow a stock idea or two from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holdings. The Oracle of Omaha has a great track record when it comes to finding long-term value, after all. You'd do well to follow the lead of Buffett and his acolytes."", ""With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three Buffett picks that would easily be at home in your portfolio as well. Note that none of the picks are named Apple, either. While the maker of the iPhone is Berkshire's single-biggest holding (by far) at this time, it's also become an expensive stock thanks to this year's firm bullishness. If you're looking for a Buffett pick worth stepping into right now, you're better off with other options."", 'In no particular order...', ""Credit card company American Express (NYSE: AXP) certainly isn't as big as Visa or Mastercard, both of which are also found among Berkshire Hathaway's holdings. But there's a reason Buffett's holding a far bigger stake in American Express than he is in rivals Mastercard and Visa. That reason is arguably the strength of AmEx's perks program."", ""See, Visa and Mastercard are merely credit card payment network operators, issuing and managing cards on behalf of banks and other companies with access to lots of would-be borrowers. American Express is different, however. It's a soup-to-nuts outfit, not only handling payment and merchant logistics, but managing its own expansive perks and rewards programs that encourage the use of its cards."", ""For instance, consumers with an American Express Platinum card are reimbursed up to $20 per month on select streaming services, enjoy access to hundreds of private lounges at airports, and get hundreds of dollars worth of yearly credit toward services like hotel stays, airline tickets, and rides provided by Uber. That's why cardholders are willing to pay an annual fee of $695 for their Platinum American Express card."", 'Of course, the company also gets a small piece of the amount of each purchase made by its cardholders.', ""None of this is to suggest Visa or Mastercard aren't worth owning, or that AmEx simply shrugs off any and all trouble (like economic malaise). It poses predictable risks too. Worries about these risks are why American Express shares haven't made any net progress since the middle of 2021."", ""But the company itself is still doing just fine. This year's top line is on pace to grow by 15%, with more than a 9% improvement predicted for next year. Profits are growing accordingly, underscoring the argument that a well-managed card rewards program is marketable in almost any economic environment."", ""You won't find quite as much revenue and earnings growth with Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) as you will with American Express. But what Coca-Cola lacks in growth firepower, it more than makes up for in reliable dividends and dividend growth. The company's not only been able to pay a dividend every quarter for the past several decades, but it's been able to raise its per-share dividend payout every year for the past 61 years. This year's increase raised it from $0.44 per share every quarter to $0.46 per share -- a 4.5% year-over-year increase that's in line with the dividend growth seen over the course of the past couple of decades."", ""You of course know Coca-Cola is the parent to its popular namesake beverage. What you may not realize is that Minute Maid juices, Powerade sports drinks, Gold Peak tea, and Dasani water are just some of the other brands that are part of the company. The diversity of its portfolio is part of the reason for the company's dividend-supporting cash flow; it's got something to sell to everyone at any given time."", ""That's only part of the reason shareholders can expect more of the same into the indefinite future. Just as important (if not more so) is the recent evolution of Coca-Cola's business model."", ""The company spent the better part of the past several years backing away from being in the bottling business, punting that work back to localized bottlers so it can better focus on what it does best. That's marketing and licensing, and then collecting royalties from the bottlers using its flavors and brand names. While this has ultimately meant less revenue, it also means more net profits."", ""Investors getting into a position in Coca-Cola today will be stepping in while the dividend yield is a respectable 3.1%. You can find bigger yields. You'd be hard-pressed, however, to find a yield this strong from shares of a company with this much reliable dividend growth."", 'Last but not least, add Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks you might want to scoop up for yourself.', 'Some investors may recall this Berkshire holding has a bit of a checkered past. Buffett was one of the key orchestrators of 2015\'s merger of then-separate Kraft and Heinz companies, with Berkshire kicking in several billion dollars of its own to see the deal all the way through. By 2019, the combined companies were suffering regular write-downs, however, taking a toll on Berkshire Hathaway\'s bottom line as well. As Buffett bluntly conceded at the time, ""I was wrong in a couple of ways on Kraft Heinz ... We overpaid for Kraft.""', ""The market doesn't seem to disagree. Kraft Heinz shares are still trading right around where they were in 2019 immediately after several of the challenges linked to the melding of the two food giants were fully exposed."", ""We're now nearly five years removed from the realization of that debacle, however. Not only are those problems now fully in the past, the inflation that was so troubling last year and early this year is also abating."", ""The evidence? Last quarter's modest top-line growth of 1% was paired with a 21.2% improvement in gross profits, extending trends that got going early this year. Overall net income and per-share profit growth are also consistently outpacing sales growth this year, reflecting the strength of all the company's brand names that extend far beyond well-known Kraft and Heinz. Maxwell House, Jell-O, Ore-Ida, and Oscar Mayer are just a sampling of the other names in The Kraft Heinz Company's portfolio."", ""More and more investors are seemingly starting to see this company's finally working its way out of its funk; shares have soared since its third-quarter results were released early last month."", ""At a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of only 15.1 and a dividend yield of 4.4%, there's plenty more room for Kraft Heinz shares to continue marching higher."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Kraft Heinz right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Kraft Heinz, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Kraft Heinz wasn't one of them.

Search and other revenue grew 11% year over year in the third quarter, while YouTube ad revenue grew 12% year over year. Solid growth in these businesses, along with improving profitability in Google Cloud, which also benefits from AI demand, pushed the stock up 46% in 2023.', ""In search, Google's investments in generative AI technology will deliver more accurate results for users. The endgame for Google is more clicks on advertisements because that's what generates revenue.

Analysts expect revenue to grow another 12% in 2024.', ""The company's growth strategy centers around expanding the places that accept Mastercard. The big opportunity here is with the emergence of digital ordering and delivery. New delivery services are transforming what used to be a single transaction at a store into as many as three transactions between the customer, the delivery driver, and the merchant. This significantly expands Mastercard's addressable market."", 'Over the last five years, Mastercard doubled the number of acceptance points for its card. The adoption of digital wallets on phones is allowing Mastercard to deliver financial services in emerging markets.', ""The world is a big place, and that's why Mastercard should be able to grow for a long time. It's also why investors are willing to pay a high forward P/E of 34 for the stock right now. It's not too expensive considering the company's long runway of growth and global brand dominance. Wall Street's long-term earnings growth estimate is currently 19% on an annualized basis."", ""Costco is a simple business that wins customers by selling quality merchandise at rock-bottom prices. It's a formula that has worked for decades and continues to reward investors. The stock has nearly tripled in value over the last five years. While it may not continue to climb at that rate, it has one advantage over the competition that should keep the business growing in value for years to come."", ""Costco warehouses are fun to shop at. Customers pay the annual membership fee for access, which helps fuel most of the company's operating profit."", ""But the key ingredient to Costco's success is what goes on behind the scenes. The warehouses are stacked high to the ceiling with huge quantities of goods, but Costco is very good at buying only what it knows is going to sell. Costco's inventory turnover ratio -- a measure of how many times it has sold and replaced inventory over a given period -- is well above those of other leading retailers."", ""Costco generates razor-thin margins on sales, which makes high inventory turnover essential to its success. High customer demand for items is ultimately linked to Costco's stellar financial results, especially where it matters most. Over the last 10 years, Costco has grown earnings per share at an above-average rate of 11.8% per year."", ""Costco's no-frills, high-volume purchasing business strategy won't become obsolete with technological changes.

It's expensive, but Costco has never looked cheap by traditional valuation metrics."", ""A new investor who starts buying shares at regular intervals and holds for 20 years will build an investment in a resilient business that could pay dividends for a lifetime.

Recently, Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) witnessed a notable insider sell event that has put the spotlight on the company's stock movement. James Cathey, the Chief Commercial Officer of Qualcomm Inc, sold 1,000 shares of the company on December 11, 2023. This transaction has prompted a closer look at the insider's trading patterns and the potential implications for Qualcomm's stock valuation."", ""James Cathey is a key executive at Qualcomm Inc, serving as the Chief Commercial Officer. His role at Qualcomm involves overseeing the company's commercial strategies and initiatives, which are critical for maintaining and expanding Qualcomm's market presence. Cathey's position gives him a deep understanding of the company's operations and market dynamics, making his trading activities particularly noteworthy for investors and market analysts."", ""Qualcomm Inc is a leading player in the semiconductor industry, known for its innovations in wireless technology. The company designs and markets a wide array of products and services that are integral to the functioning of wireless networks and devices. Qualcomm's offerings include mobile processors, modems, and platforms that support the global proliferation of smartphones, tablets, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. With a strong focus on research and development, Qualcomm is at the forefront of advancing 5G technology and other wireless innovations that are shaping the future of communication."", ""The recent sell transaction by James Cathey is part of a broader pattern of insider activity at Qualcomm Inc. Over the past year, Cathey has sold a total of 5,000 shares and has not made any purchases. This one-sided selling trend raises questions about the insiders' confidence in the company's near-term growth prospects.When examining the overall insider transaction history for Qualcomm Inc, there have been no insider buys in the past year, contrasted with 13 insider sells during the same period. This trend suggests a cautious or bearish sentiment among insiders, which could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the stock's potential to appreciate in value."", ""The relationship between insider trading activity and stock price is complex. While insider sells do not always indicate a problem with the company, they can sometimes precede a downturn in the stock's performance. Investors often monitor insider sells as part of their due diligence, considering them alongside other financial metrics and market indicators."", ""On the day of Cathey's recent sell, Qualcomm Inc's shares were trading at $134.51, giving the company a substantial market cap of $152.125 billion. The price-earnings ratio stood at 21.29, lower than the industry median of 25.825 but higher than Qualcomm's historical median price-earnings ratio. This suggests that, compared to its peers, Qualcomm's stock might be undervalued based on earnings.Regarding the stock's intrinsic value, the price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.96 indicates that Qualcomm Inc is Fairly Valued based on its GF Value of $139.58. The GF Value is a proprietary metric developed by GuruFocus, factoring in historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment for past performance, and future business estimates from analysts."", ""The insider sell activity by James Cathey at Qualcomm Inc is a development that warrants attention from the investment community. While the Chief Commercial Officer's decision to sell shares does not necessarily predict a negative trajectory for the stock, it is a piece of the puzzle that investors must consider when evaluating Qualcomm's investment potential.With Qualcomm's stock deemed Fairly Valued according to the GF Value and the company's strong position in the semiconductor industry, investors may find the current stock price an attractive entry point, provided they are comfortable with the insider selling trend and have confidence in the company's long-term growth prospects.As always, investors are encouraged to look beyond insider activity and consider a comprehensive analysis of Qualcomm's financial health, market position, and future growth opportunities before making any investment decisions."", 'Warning!

The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Johnson & Johnson belongs, has gained 1.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making."", 'Earnings Estimate Revisions', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'Johnson & Johnson is expected to post earnings of $2.37 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.9%.

The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is of consequence because whenever a stock is bought or sold, the trade takes at least two business day to settle. Accordingly, Medtronic investors that purchase the stock on or after the 19th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 12th of January."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.69 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$2.76 per share. Last year's total dividend payments show that Medtronic has a trailing yield of 3.4% on the current share price of $81.9. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic ', ""If a company pays out more in dividends than it earned, then the dividend might become unsustainable - hardly an ideal situation. It paid out 89% of its earnings as dividends last year, which is not unreasonable, but limits reinvestment in the business and leaves the dividend vulnerable to a business downturn. We'd be concerned if earnings began to decline. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Medtronic generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. The company paid out 90% of its free cash flow over the last year, which we think is outside the ideal range for most businesses. Cash flows are usually much more volatile than earnings, so this could be a temporary effect - but we'd generally want to look more closely here."", ""Medtronic paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to Medtronic's ability to maintain its dividend."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Medtronic, with earnings per share up 6.2% on average over the last five years. Earnings have been growing at a steady rate, but we're concerned dividend payments consumed most of the company's cash flow over the past year."", ""The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Medtronic has delivered 10% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. It's encouraging to see the company lifting dividends while earnings are growing, suggesting at least some corporate interest in rewarding shareholders."", ""Has Medtronic got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Earnings per share have grown somewhat, although Medtronic paid out over half its profits and the dividend was not well covered by free cash flow. With the way things are shaping up from a dividend perspective, we'd be inclined to steer clear of Medtronic."", ""So if you're still interested in Medtronic despite it's poor dividend qualities, you should be well informed on some of the risks facing this stock.

The procedure, called renal denervation, is intended to offer an alternative for patients who have tried medications and lifestyle changes to reduce their blood pressure. ', 'Questions about efficacy and who benefits most from the treatments could be hurdles to adoption as both companies seek insurance coverage.', 'Medical device companies have been working for more than a decade to bring a renal denervation treatment to market. ', 'Jason Weidman, Medtronic’s president of coronary and renal denervation, estimated that at one point, the company had more than 40 competitors in renal denervation. Boston Scientific and St. Jude Medical were two companies that pulled out of the space after Medtronic failed to meet the primary endpoint of a randomized controlled trial of its Symplicity Spyral device in 2014, and J&J sold its Cordis business, which had a CE-marked device for renal denervation. ', 'The minimally invasive procedure involves a surgeon guiding a catheter into the renal arteries. From there, they can use pulses of ultrasound or radiofrequency energy to damage some of the sympathetic nerves in the arteries.', 'The goal of the procedure is to lower a patient’s blood pressure by reducing overactivity in those nerves.', '“If you calm the nerves down, it helps reduce the overactivity of the sympathetic nervous system and helps reduce hypertension,” Recor CEO Lara Barghout said in an interview. ', 'The Department of Health and Human Services estimates that nearly 120 million people in the U.S. — about half of all adults — have hypertension, and only about one in four people have it under control. ', 'The current standard of care for treating high blood pressure is medication and lifestyle changes. Multiple types of medicine can be layered into a treatment regimen, including diuretics, beta blockers and ACE inhibitors. But the side effects of these medications can sometimes cause problems for patients, and adherence is worse when there are so many medications to take, Barghout said. ', ""“It's really inspiring to talk to patients who have already received this therapy through the clinical trials, the ones that have uncontrolled resistant hypertension, how it has literally turned their life around,” she said. "", 'Recor’s Paradise system, which the FDA approved in early November, uses ultrasound for ablation, while Medtronic’s Symplicity Spyral system, approved later that month, uses radiofrequency energy. ', 'Both devices are labeled as adjunctive treatments for when medications and lifestyle changes aren’t enough to control patients’ blood pressure. ', 'Barghout described it as a “wide label,” in the sense that it didn’t specify patients must have uncontrolled or resistant hypertension.', ""“What we want to do is make sure that we're very deliberate in reaching patients that absolutely need it in the first few years. And I think those patients mostly are the ones with uncontrolled resistant hypertension,” Barghout said. "", 'She added that Recor plans to launch a global registry to recruit and monitor patients for at least five years to show the long-term efficacy of Paradise. ', 'An FDA advisory panel in August recommended that the FDA approve Recor’s device but voted against approval of Medtronic’s device. For Recor’s Paradise system, panelists voted unanimously in favor of the device’s safety and 10-2 in favor of its risk-benefit profile, raising questions about the long-term durability of the treatment.', 'For Medtronic’s Symplicity Spyral system, the panelists voted unanimously for safety but found the benefits did not outweigh the risks by a 6-7 vote. They noted that a recent study of the device missed its primary endpoint, while an earlier study only showed a small benefit. ', 'Keith Allen, surgical director of the structural heart program at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, said he voted no on both devices in the panel. ', ""“I didn't think either device from Recor or Medtronic met the level that warranted approval,” he said in an interview. “The data, in my opinion, is not very robust.” "", 'Allen also cautioned that because the devices have different mechanisms for denervating the renal artery, it’s not fair to assume that because one device works, the other does as well.', '“The preponderance of the data would suggest that if there is a benefit for renal denervation with regard to reducing blood pressure, it’s in my opinion, marginal at best,” Allen said. “And while the procedure is low risk, whether it is worthwhile for a patient to have the invasive procedure is going to have to be between the provider and the patient.” ', 'Allen said he would consider renal denervation as an option if a patient continued to have high blood pressure after being on a good medical regimen. ', ""“My concern is the data is such that some patients, they were only on one medication. To me, that's not medically resistant hypertension, and I'm concerned that doctors may use this product in place of good medical care, and I don't think invasive procedures should ever replace a pill or an easy medication.” "", 'Medtronic last estimated the value of the market for renal denervation at $500 million in 2026, growing to a range of from $2 billion to $3 billion by 2030. ', 'The company has not reiterated those estimates since it shared its clinical trial results in late 2022, BTIG analyst Ryan Zimmerman said. ', ""“Even though it got approved, because of the nature of the data, there were these lingering questions about whether the pathway to reimbursement would be more challenging because it wasn't a home run,” he said. "", 'When asked about market size, Medtronic’s Weidman said that “about 1% penetration of the market would yield a market size of over a billion dollars.” ', '“The ultimate possibility is quite large,” Weidman said. “How quickly we ramp up to that is TBD and is going to be determined on a lot of these factors like reimbursement, but we’re confident that this is going to be a good market for Medtronic.”', 'RBC Capital Markets analyst Shagun Singh estimated that the U.S. market would be split 80-20 between Medtronic and Recor. She thinks that even though Recor received better feedback from the FDA panel, Medtronic will take the leading share because of marketing and the fact that the company has “invested a whole lot for 10 years in this program.” ', 'Currently, Recor and Medtronic are the only competitors in the U.S. market, although Barghout expects that will change. ', ""“I think the space is so prime that there will be more competing devices in the future as well. That's our expectation,” Barghout said. “And I think the patient population is large enough for several competitors to be in the market.” "", 'Questions about the data also factor into insurance coverage. ', 'Weidman said Medtronic will start commercialization “immediately.” The company did its first procedure in late November and plans to start the rollout at sites that participated in its clinical trial.', ""“We're working with [the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services] to try to determine what the most appropriate path is in order to gain coverage. Typically, with a new therapy like this, it takes about 12 months or so,” Weidman said."", 'Singh said the company is pursuing Medicare’s New Technology Add-On Payments for inpatient coverage and Transitional Pass-Through Payments for outpatient coverage because it has a breakthrough device designation.', 'Medtronic has an established sales channel through its coronary business and a therapy development field team to support hypertension programs, according to Weidman.', 'In Europe, where Medtronic’s device has been on the market since 2013, Weidman said reimbursement has been limited because the European Society of Cardiology’s guidelines state that renal denervation should only be used in a clinical trial setting. When the ESC set those guidelines in 2018, it recommended waiting until further evidence on the devices’ safety and efficacy becomes available. ', ""“Until those guidelines are updated, which we don't expect for another year or so, that's obviously going to hold back some usage,” he said. "", 'Recor announced its first procedures in early November. CEO Barghout said the company is going through the process of gaining coverage as a breakthrough device. ', '“So it does take a while to get to full coverage,” Barghout said. “But in the meantime, there are bridge codes, as we call them, that can help hospitals in the process of treating patients.” ', 'She added that she hopes to get to widespread use next year. ', ""“We're marching on that journey, and we're very confident that we're going to get there,” said Barghout."", 'This story was originally published on MedTech Dive.

A key factor in our view that could help propel healthier valuations remains the prospect of innovation, fueling new product cycles that have the potential to redefine market landscapes and growth trajectories.”', 'With this in mind, Shibutani has been pointing investors toward 3 healthcare giants with decent prospects ahead, so we decided to give them a closer look. All have underperformed this year, but Shibutani expects them to recover in 2024. To get an idea of what the rest of the Street makes of their chances, we also ran them through the TipRanks database. Here’s the lowdown.', 'Time to Hit Buy on These 2 Building Stocks, Says Deutsche Bank', 'These\xa02 MedTech Stocks Look Too Cheap to Ignore, Says Morgan Stanley', 'Morgan Stanley Says\xa0These 3 Semiconductor Stocks Are Hot Buys Right Now', 'Merck & Company (MRK)', 'We’ll start with Merck, a leading pharmaceutical firm with global networks for both sales and research, wide-spread partnerships with other drug companies to facilitate research programs, and a market cap exceeding $264 billion. Merck’s name alone is worth plenty for reputation; the company created the wide-spread MMR vaccine that protects newborn infants against measles-mumps-rubella.', 'In today’s market, Merck is probably best-known for products like Gardasil, the widespread HPV vaccine that is used to protect women from virus-linked cervical cancers; Keytruda, the oncology-immunotherapy drug frequently used in the treatment of numerous malignancies; and Remicade, the biological anti-inflammatory drug used in the treatment of autoimmune conditions like Crohn’s or rheumatoid arthritis.', 'Merck’s global sales in 2022 totaled $59.3 billion, marking a 22% year-over-year increase. The company’s sales are lagging that pace slightly in 2023 – for the first nine months of this year, Merck’s total revenue comes to $45.66 billion, compared to $45.99 billion in the same period of last year. We should note that, year-to-date, Merck’s stock is down approximately 4%, an unfavorable comparison to the 20% year-to-date gain on the S&P 500.', 'At the same time, Merck’s report for 3Q23, the last released, shows solid year-over-year gains, with worldwide sales up 7% y/y to $16 billion, beating expectations by $730 million. The strong revenue was driven by solid sales in Keytruda (up 17% y/y), in Gardasil (up 13% y/y), and in the anti-COVID-19 drug Lagevrio (up 47% y/y). Quarterly sales for these three drugs totaled $9.54 billion. At the bottom line, Merck realized a non-GAAP earnings per share of $2.13, 18 cents better than had been expected.', 'For Shibutani, the key point to understand about Merck is the company’s overall sound position. He acknowledges that the firm will face loss of exclusivity (LOE) on several drugs in the near-term, but adds that it has both a solid portfolio of approved products and plenty of research projects in the pipeline. He says, “In an environment where end-of-decade LOEs remain a sticking point for much of US large cap pharma, we believe MRK has delivered effective superlative progress in terms of addressing concerns regarding the growth outlook for the company – through and beyond the Keytruda LOE. We further believe that MRK’s decision-making and execution on the business development front will increasingly be revealed as best-in-class amongst industry peers.”', 'For the near-term, and of interest to investors seeking an attractively priced entry point, Shibutani adds, “The relatively tempered share performance in the 2H23 has reflected in our view, the perception of a relative lack of headline generating catalysts. We see current levels as highly attractive, with the set-up for shares heading into 2024 framed by the opportunity for pipeline assets highlighted to become headliners, providing catalyst paths for a return to outperformance.”', 'All of this adds up to a Top Pick to go on Goldman’s Conviction List. The stock naturally gets a Buy rating, which Shibutani supplements with a $128 price target – implying a one-year upside potential of 23%. (To watch Shibutani’s track record, click here.)', 'The Strong Buy analyst consensus rating on Merck’s stock is based on 15 recent reviews that break down 13 to 2 in favor of Buy over Hold. The shares are trading for $104.36 and their $126.29 average price target suggests an increase of 21% in the coming 12 months. (See Merck’s stock forecast.)', 'AbbVie, Inc. (ABBV)', 'The second stock on our list of Goldman picks is AbbVie. This company has established itself as a leader in the research and development of biological anti-inflammatory medications, the class that has become prevalent in the treatment of autoimmune inflammatory disorders such as Crohn’s, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis. This puts AbbVie into direct competition with Merck’s Remicade.', 'We should note, however, that the market for such anti-inflammatory autoimmune drugs is both large and growing. According to Global Market Insights, it was thought to be worth $104 billion last year, and is expected to reach as high as $233.6 billion by 2032 – there is room here for both AbbVie and Merck to find customers. In addition, AbbVie has a larger portfolio of products in this niche, which has become something of a specialty for the company. AbbVie’s anti-inflammatory drugs include Humira, Skyrizi, and Rinvoq. The first of these was first approved for use in 2002, the latter two both in 2019.', 'AbbVie, which is based in North Chicago, Illinois, sees high potential for these drugs going forward – and the company, in its last quarterly report, revised its full-year 2023 earnings outlook upward accordingly, setting expectations for adjusted diluted EPS this year in the range of $11.19 to $11.23. This compares to the previous guidance of $10.86 to $11.06, and is well above the forecast number of $11.05.', 'Diving into that Q3 report, we find that AbbVie’s revenues and earnings in 3Q23 were both down y/y. The top line, showing revenue of $13.93 billion, was down 6%, while the bottom line, the adjusted diluted EPS of $2.95, was down more than 19%. Both figures beat expectations, however; revenue by $220 million and EPS by 8 cents per share. We should note here that shares in AbbVie have underperformed this year, and are down 2% overall.', 'In his write-up on AbbVie for Goldman, Shibutani takes an upbeat long-term view, basing his stance on the strength of the Humira-Skyrizi-Rinvoq stable of drugs. He writes, “As we exit 2023, ABBV’s delivery of more resilient than expected revenue performance for the Humira franchise in the face of multiple biosimilar entrants our confidence has increased in the potential for performance from growth products (Skyrizi, Rinvoq) and signature franchises (i.e., Botox) to generate an overall company growth profile heading through most of the remainder of the decade, that scales to management’s guidance, exceeds current Street expectations, and provides the basis for our view that ABBV’s current share price reflects underappreciation of the company’s improving growth outlook.”', 'This positive stance goes along with a Buy rating, an upgrade from Neutral, while Shibutani’s $173 price target points toward a one-year upside of 13%.', 'AbbVie has a Moderate Buy consensus rating from the Street, after picking up 13 recent analyst reviews, with 8 to Buy and 5 to Hold. The average target price of $170.25 suggests an increase of 11% from the current trading price of $153.24. (See AbbVie’s stock forecast.)', 'Pfizer (PFE)', 'We’ll wrap up this Goldman-backed list with Pfizer, the large-cap pharma that made headlines during the pandemic with its development of an early COVID-19 vaccine as well as the anti-viral drug Paxlovid. Pfizer, which boasts a $161 billion market cap, is one of the world’s premier biopharmaceutical firms. It has a long list of approved products on the market, and generated over $100 billion in revenue in 2022. The company defines its mission as creating a healthier world, and since the COVID pandemic, it has dedicated large resources to the combat of related highly contagious respiratory viral diseases.', 'In addition to its revenue-generating product lines, Pfizer has an active research pipeline that currently features 83 drug candidates in human clinical trials. Of these, 30 are at Phase 2, 23 are at Phase 3, and 4 are registrational, the final step before submitting applications for regulatory approval. The ‘areas of focus’ in Pfizer’s pipeline include anti-infectives and vaccines, inflammation and immunology, oncology, and rare diseases.', 'Leading-edge biotech research is a risky business, and Pfizer recently discontinued a clinical trial on a weight-loss drug, danuglipron. The drug had advanced through the Phase 2 stage – but while it achieved its primary endpoints in the study, there were high rates of side effects, including nausea and vomiting. The company chose not to pursue further research on this track.', 'That round of bad news comes after slowing sales year-to-date. Pfizer’s first three quarters this year all saw y/y declines in revenue. The company’s stock price reflects that – PFE is down 42% this year.', 'On a positive note, Pfizer received on December 12 regulatory approval from US government oversight agencies for its proposed merger-acquisition of the research-oriented biotech firm Seagen. The acquisition agreement is valued at $43 billion, and will add Seagen’s portfolio into Pfizer’s programs. Pfizer has said that it will create a dedicated cancer drugs operation from the expanded portfolio, and will split its business side into a US division and a global division.', 'Watching these developments, top analyst Shibutani notes first, that Pfizer’s share decline has tracked slowing sales of COVID-19 vaccines and treatments, and second, that there is reason for optimism here. He says, to start, “Acknowledging that PFE share performance has largely tracked expectations for sales from its COVID-19 franchise, we are constructive on the stock heading into 2024 following a material guidance reset in mid-October that, while negative and overdue, we believe better aligns management and investor expectations for Comirnaty (COVID-19 vaccine) and Paxlovid.”', 'Going on, Shibutani adds that Pfizer will be launching new products in the mid-term, and should expect returns from the Seagen deal: “Our positive outlook primarily derives from our view that COVID-19 revenues will be less debated on the forward, and we anticipate several of PFE’s bounty of new product launches will demonstrate success, heralded by commercial execution. We also believe that the potential closing of SGEN (expected by early 2024) and a return to a more balanced approach to capital allocation will represent a key strategic shift towards oncology and would achieve a significant portion of the company’s stated goal to acquire ~25bn in 2030 risk-adjusted revenue.”', 'With this in mind, Shibutani keeps his Buy rating on PFE, and although he has reduced his price target from $48 to $37, the new figure still indicates confidence in a 29% increase for the shares on the one-year horizon. (To watch Shibutani’s track record, click here.)', 'Turning now to the rest of the Street, where Pfizer gets a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on an additional 4 Buys and 8 Holds. The stock is selling for $28.58 and its $39.73 average price target implies a 39% increase from that level.

However, not all sectors exhibit equal generosity in their dividend yields. Industries like real estate and energy tend to lead the pack, boasting substantial average yields nearing 4%, while the rapidly growing tech companies tend to be more reserved, offering considerably lower yields, averaging less than 1%.', ""The year 2023 hasn't been particularly kind to dividend stocks. Specifically, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, a collection of esteemed companies renowned for their consistent dividend increases, has seen a modest uptick of just 2.57% year-to-date. This pales in comparison to the noteworthy 21.4% return witnessed by the broader S&P 500 index over the same period. However, due to the historically strong performance of dividend stocks, analysts are recommending adding these equities to investors’ portfolios in 2024. Morningstar's chief U.S. market strategist, David Sekera, holds an optimistic view regarding dividend-paying stocks as they enter the year 2024. He believes that these stocks are in a stronger position compared to their standing in the previous year. Here are some comments from the analyst:"", '“High dividend-paying sectors such as communications, utilities, and real estate are trading at levels well below our fair value estimates. In addition, our U.S. economics team forecasts interest rates will decline over the course of 2024, which will provide a tailwind for dividend stocks, which tend to be more interest-rate-sensitive.”', 'Within dividend-paying sectors, Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) stand out as one of the most sought-after choices. REITs have garnered immense popularity among investors seeking dividends due to their unique structure and inherent income-generating nature. By law, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, making them attractive for income-seeking investors. According to a report by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Listed REITs, comprising equity REITs and mortgage REITs, distributed approximately $63.1 billion to their shareholders. These listed REITs are publicly traded on stock exchanges, making their dividends widely accessible to investors. Additionally, public non-listed REITs, which function similarly to listed REITs but are not traded on public exchanges, paid out around $6.1 billion in dividends throughout the same period.', 'While REITs are renowned for their dividends, several other sectors in the market also offer solid dividend payouts to shareholders. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the most prominent dividend stocks that have grabbed investors’ attention.

The company's commitment to innovation and sustainability has made it a key player in the energy sector."", ""The recent insider sell by the CEO raises questions about the potential implications for Southern Co's stock price and the company's valuation. Insider transactions can provide valuable insights into a company's health and future prospects. When an insider sells a significant amount of shares, it can sometimes signal a lack of confidence in the company's future performance or suggest that the insider believes the stock is currently overvalued."", ""However, it's important to consider the broader context of insider activity. According to the data, Stephen Kuczynski has sold a total of 59,546 shares over the past year and has not made any purchases. This pattern of selling without corresponding buys could be interpreted in various ways, but without additional information, it's difficult to draw definitive conclusions."", ""Looking at the insider trends for Southern Co, there have been no insider buys and 25 insider sells over the past year. This trend suggests that insiders, on balance, have been more inclined to sell their shares rather than acquire more. This could be due to a variety of reasons, including personal financial planning or portfolio diversification, rather than a negative outlook on the company's future."", ""On the valuation front, Southern Co's shares were trading at $71.23 on the day of Kuczynski's sell, giving the company a market cap of $77.56 billion. The price-earnings ratio stands at 25.77, which is higher than both the industry median of 14.5 and the company's historical median.

The GF Value of $72.02 is slightly above the current trading price, suggesting that the stock is not significantly over or undervalued.', ""The GF Value is calculated considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past returns and growth, and future business performance estimates from Morningstar analysts. This comprehensive approach to valuation provides a balanced view of the stock's intrinsic value."", ""When analyzing the relationship between insider selling and stock price, it's crucial to remember that many factors can influence a stock's price. While insider transactions can be a piece of the puzzle, they should not be viewed in isolation. Market conditions, company performance, industry trends, and broader economic factors all play a role in determining a stock's price."", ""It's also worth noting that insiders may sell shares for reasons unrelated to their outlook on the company. These can include personal financial planning, tax considerations, or diversifying their investments. Therefore, while insider sells can be a signal worth monitoring, they are not always indicative of a company's future performance."", ""In conclusion, the recent insider sell by Stephen Kuczynski is a significant event that warrants attention. However, investors should consider the full context of insider activity, the company's valuation, and other market factors before making any investment decisions.

The company will now pay out $1.47 per share, reflecting a hike of 5% from the prior dividend of $1.40.Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $5.88 per share, marking an increase of 28 cents from the prior dividend. At this new rate, the annualized yield comes at 4.61%, based on the stock’s closing price of $127.63 on Dec 12. The new dividend will be paid out on Jan 31 to shareholders of record as of Jan 12, 2024.Solid dividend payouts are arguably the biggest enticements for REIT shareholders, and MAA remains committed to the same. The company has a good record of paying out dividends to its shareholders. The recent hike reflects MAA’s ability to generate solid income through its operating platform and high-quality portfolio. It also marks the 14th consecutive year MAA has hiked its dividend. In the last five years, MAA increased its dividend six times and its five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 8.74%. Check Mid-America Apartment’s dividend history here.MAA’s well-diversified Sun Belt-focused portfolio is poised to benefit from the healthy renter demand in its markets. The favorable in-migration trends of jobs and households in these submarkets, and high home ownership costs continue to aid demand. MAA’s technological initiatives and encouraging redevelopment projects are expected to fuel margin expansion, boding well for long-term growth. We project an average physical occupancy of 95.6% for 2023.MAA enjoys a solid balance sheet, with low leverage and ample availability under its revolving credit facility. As of Sep 30, 2023, the company had a strong balance sheet, with $1.4 billion in combined cash and capacity available under its unsecured revolving credit facility, and a historically low net debt/adjusted EBITDAre ratio of 3.4. In the third quarter of 2023, it generated 95.8% unencumbered NOI, providing the scope for tapping additional secured debt capital if required. Hence, the company is well-positioned to bank on growth scopes.Moreover, this REIT’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) highlights its growth potential. The company’s ROE of 9.30% compares favorably with the industry’s 5.07%, reflecting that MAA is more efficient in using shareholders’ funds than its peers.Backed by healthy operating fundamentals, we expect the company’s core FFO to increase 8.5% year over year in the current year. Moreover, given its balance sheet strength and prudent financial management, the company is well-poised to capitalize on growth opportunities and reward shareholders handsomely. Looking at its lower dividend payout (than its industry), its dividend distribution is expected to be sustainable.However, shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 2.8% over the past month, slightly underperforming the industry’s growth of 3%.

They discuss how spending trends changed and what that means for home improvement retailers, fast fashion, come back and why everybody wants to be Lulu Lemon."", ""Deidre Woollard: Let's start with one of the core stories of 2023, which is, I've called before, the unsinkable consumer. The consumer just kept spending good news, bad news. Whatever was coming its way, we just all kept spending, we kept going out. The good news for the future is that inflation is going down, but the bad news is, student loan payments are back. There are some signs of a little consumer weakness. People are saving less, they're putting more on credit cards, they're using more buy now, pay later. As you think about that, Asit I'll start with you, how much are you worried about the consumer in the coming year and how are you thinking about the consumer habits of the past year."", ""Asit Sharma: Deidre, I'm looking at the year ahead as one of a reset for the consumer. There's some spending exhaustion out there. You noted factors that are driving a little bit more hesitancy on the part of the consumer. Those student loan payments starting up just higher interest rates in general, which means that you've got a bigger payout to maintain your credit status if you're using credit cards to make those purchases. But I do think over the longer term, the fact that the US economy has been able to pull off somewhat of a soft landing so far is a good sign for the intermediate term, even if we hit a slight recession next year and the consumer which has been supporting the economy pulls back. Longer term, the growth of the US economy, the tightness of the job market, are factors that are positive both for GDP growth and an eventual resumption of spend even if it's late 2024, 2025."", 'Deidre Woollard: Toby, how are you thinking about the consumer?', ""Toby Bordelon: There is, as Asit says, in pastency for the consumer heading into the next year. But I also get the sense, or I have the sense, maybe this is incorrect, that a lot of the concerns we've heard about the economy from consumer sentiment, maybe not being all that great, that sort of thing might just be a product of the price side of inflation and people not thinking too much about the wage side of inflation. Look at what the UAW won in the latest negotiation with the automakers. That's a lot of extra money in those consumers pockets. When you ask consumers, are you concerned, they say, yes, I am. But it comes from the fact that you go to the grocery store and milk is more expensive. You don't maybe see the increase in your paycheck on a daily basis quite as much. But when you do go to make the spending choices, you look at your savings account like, there's some money there. I can make this happen. I do know my salary has gone up. I can make this happen. I'm optimistic, there have been wage gains, there have been income gains. We're going to kind of see that play out. Is there going to be a boom? Probably not, but I'm just not convinced that we're going to see a big pullback from consumers. They're going to be pretty stable heading into 2024."", ""Deidre Woollard: You mentioned something interesting there, which is that, yes, when you have those surveys, people say that they're concerned but they're still spending. There's a disconnect between what they're worried about and what they're thinking about, and their activity which has continued even as they were very worried at the peak of inflation, it didn't really stop the behavior. I want to ask one more question about 2023. I felt 2022 was the year of inventory. Every retailer was telling us, you know, we have an inventory proper, we're reducing inventory, most of them in 2023 knocked that out. But this year has been the year of shrink. People talking about shoplifting concerns of overall shrink. Shrink was the word I heard the most. Do you feel retailers are reaching the end of wrestling with that issue now as we head into a new year?"", ""Asit Sharma: I think that some retailers handle this issue much better than others, and some retailers are concentrated in areas which you're going through more economic disruption. They are dealing with, in some cases, organized theft, and surprisingly, haven't been prepared on how to prevent that. Shrink in terms of the biggest news story this year, which is just the theft of retail merchandise is going to be less of a story in 2024. We've seen measures taken by a lot of mass retailers like Target, which aren't that obtrusive to the consumer, but they include just small steps like having security at night and closing or having more of a presence of security. Not necessarily a lot of it, just more visible. We have seen more of those irritating instances of things you wouldn't expect to be under lock and key suddenly behind the glass case with the key, you have to call the clerk to help you get a pack of shaving cartridges. We've seen some more of that with retailers, but I don't think it's going to be as much of a story in this coming year. It tends to be newsworthy just because it's something scary. Just as if you look at certain statistics of shoplifting over the past several decades, as an incidence, that's down from decades ago, but we see it much more in social media and the news. Not to say that it isn't getting bad in a few places. San Francisco has consistently pointed to as a retail area where you're seeing much more theft and brazen theft. But overall, I don't think it's going to have quite the newsworthy field that it didn't this year, retailers are handling it better. I was curious, Toby, what are your thoughts on this."", ""Toby Bordelon: That's right. I'm not sure it's going to be a big issue heading in next year. I like what you said about the visibility. We see it more so it seems to be a bigger issue. You can call me skeptical, but I wonder if in large, maybe not in large part, but if part of this was retailers using as an excuse for some things, our margins are going down, it's because there's shrinkage. We can just use that as an excuse in the earnings call and people will buy that. I'm sure it was it a part of it, sure. But if you highlight that as the issue that is beyond your control, it's more of a bigger social issue, it doesn't really speak to your business specifically. You can avoid blame a little bit for maybe there's declining margins or made some bad decisions you made, or you can avoid outright telling people our margin are down because our costs are up, and that's not changing anytime soon so just deal with it. This is the problem that can go away. You leave investors with some optimism and you leave them with thinking that, well, it's not entirely your fault, maybe we'll cut him a little slack. Then maybe he gives you an excuse or some cover to exit some markets or close some stores that you might have wanted to close anyway. It was a real issue, but it was also a convenient opportunity for some management teams to close down some stores, and to maybe avoid some blame on the earnings calls."", ""Deidre Woollard: I have heard other people express that theory as well. You're definitely not alone on that. Let's talk a little bit about the ways that consumers spent last year and what we think for next year. Because another thing that we heard over and over in retail earnings was consumer discretionary is hard hit. It was a good year for grocery, good year for smaller items, bad year for big ticket items, especially anything related to your house. Not a great year for Home Depot, for Lowe's, not a great year for Best Buy Electronics have been down. I'm thinking about this two ways, because the Home Depot and Lowe's thing, I feel maybe we're going to start to see people spending more on projects, but it's so tied to the housing market that I worry about it. But with electronics, so much of the spending was during the pandemic. We're now, a few years out, I wonder if that's going to come back. Asit, I'll start with you, what are you thinking about the big ticket spending?"", ""Asit Sharma: I think that the big ticket spending is going to continue to be on hold. One beneficiary of that in the world of Lowe's and Home Depot are the pro contractors. They're still in demand because while bigger projects are put on hold, there's still just a dearth of new housing. What Home Depot's and Lowe's have to do now is to cater to where the demand is, and it's in those small contractors who aren't necessarily doing project work for people who own homes, but still out there working on construction projects. They're a beneficiary of that. The other side of that is maybe you're onto something, if we're not spending on those big ticket items where we spend, I follow the semiconductor industry, what are called super lagging edge fabs that make a lot of low end chips. These are the ones that are produced on 6-8 inch wafers. It's not those very small four nanometer process cutting edge chips you hear about, but the stuff that goes into consumer electronics. We were looking at a glut of those chips after the pandemic. Typically in a semiconductor cycle, when you have a glut, it takes two years to work off that oversupply. Guess what? We're about two years out of the peak of the pandemic. I'm starting to see some signs in the tiles that there is going to be an uptick of demand for electronics, again, on the part of consumers. That may be reading the picture backward. You look consumer demand first and then see what the supply looks like. But, the fact that there is no longer a huge amount of inventory of these low end chips sitting with manufacturers tells me that it's good conditions for those who are now looking to maybe replace a mouse that they bought during the pandemic when they were home, because it's been a couple of years. Maybe that's a trend that will see some life in 2024."", ""Deidre Woollard: Interesting. Toby, how are you thinking about it? I know you've taken a look at Best Buy recently."", ""Toby Bordelon: I think all it's right on that replacement cycle, maybe coming up. I was one of the households that bought multiple laptops in the pandemic as the kids were doing school from home. That was three years ago. Now, do you need a laptop or a tablet for each child if they're back in school? Maybe not, but they are getting a little long on the tooth, so they're going to look in and thinking maybe time for a new one. Let's replace one of those. We're getting to that point. Whether it happens this holiday season or not, we'll see. But we're certainly getting to that point, I think. You noted Best Buy, their earnings report was very interesting Deidre, because they broke down their categories and what they said is look, our big ticket items like our appliances. One thing Best Buy has done recently is move toward your bigger kitchen and household appliances they sell there. That wasn't moving as much. That was down a little bit. They talked about entertainment being up though. People were spending on things TVs, things like gaming consoles. We saw the Adobe analytics report, this came out recently for Cyber Monday, among the top products Xbox, PlayStations, and Nintendo Switches."", ""Entertainment is still receiving some spending dollars from consumers, which I find interesting. The other thing I'll note on the Home Depot lows issue, I think this goes back to the pandemic too and I think it might be less of finance issue and more of an opportunity issue. If you look at both of those companies telling us that pro business was up more than the DIY business. Well, what happens when you're working from home. You're spending more time at home. You see things that need to be done more, because you're home more. You have an opportunity to do them because you're home more. You're going to go to Home Depot, you're going to get the stuff, you're going to fix up that little thing that you might not have noticed before. Now you're going back to the office, you're homeless, so you see it less and then you have less of opportunity to do that because you're spending more time commuting. I think that might be feeding into it as well, just the lack of opportunity, the lack of desire to do some of these DIY projects is probably weighing on these retailers more so than I don't have money to do it. I'd rather spend my money on a new PlayStation, because I'm more interested in entertainment right now. I think we were partially seeing a changing consumer mix and priorities with where they're spending their money."", ""Deidre Woollard: Interesting because part of it too was, I think with retail the other thing we saw is where the money got pulled. Where it got pulled was toward travel and experiences and away from those big ticket items. It's not, I'm going to get a new refrigerator, it's, I'm going to go to France. Definitely, I've been wondering when that ends as well and dovetailing on that, where we saw the spending was grocery, beauty, wellness, anything that was repeatable and really enjoyed in the immediate moment. My impression is that that continues well on, especially even as the consumer maybe feels a little more pressured, it's the lipstick economy theory where people still want to reward themselves with the small step. What do you guys think about that?"", ""Ricky Mulvey: I think the only thing that gets in the way of that Deidre is 100-200 basis points of the Fed pulling back. If we shift gears into reverse and the Fed eases, then I think that lipstick effect, which was made famous by Avon sales in the '60s, '70s, '80s, whenever there was a recession, those sales soared. I think people then pull back from the wellness and beauty spins which are still affordable. You can do it in small increments, it makes you feel happy. But if there's a general sense in the economy that interest rates are easing, you have a little bit more in your pocket. I think people pull away from that, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. If anything, I think that the Fed maintains, and by those sales of companies that deal in beauty, as you had mentioned when we were preparing for this podcast episode that they're really strong right now."", 'Deidre Woollard: Absolutely.', ""Toby Bordelon: It's Ulta Beauty to throw one out there. It had a surprisingly good quarter with healthy traffic they were talking about. They did note that the average stick, it went down a little bit but the traffic was up. People are going there more. Maybe you're seeing a little bit that when you talked about at a little bit that pullback people aren't spending quite as much but they're still going. They're going more than they were before. Overall it's a good thing. I'm not sure I see anything Deidre changes that either in the next year. I don't see any major trends that would make people pull back too much, but I think that is certainly something to look at. That falls into that experiential category we're talking about. I mean, beauty products are stuff, but it's consumable. You're buying it for that experience, not for the thing to have and look at. It's definitely that thing. I think that we're going to continue to see spending on, I think."", ""Deidre Woollard: Well, as we wrap up, let's talk about some trends that you're following for retail in 2024 and the companies that are leading the way. Toby, let's start with you because I know you've talked a little bit about, in our notes about show room shopping, which I think we've talked about a bit and it's really interesting to me the way that we've changed how we think about the real estate of a store, because it's partly going in there to buy stuff, but it's not, we don't buy stuff the same way we did before. I think that's changing. What do you think?"", ""Toby Bordelon: I think it is too. There are a lot of new retailers out there, where there are store is really a place for you to come look but you don't expect to take the product out with you. That's now furniture has always been this way, higher end furniture, but you have some of the brands like Lovesac leaning into that. You go to the store, you try it out, you got people who can walk you through the various designs and the various fabrics and all that. Then you get delivered to your house sometime later. Warby Parker, another one that comes to mind, eyeglasses. You go in, you can do an exam there, you don't have to, but you can try on the glasses, you can see what they've got. Then you can buy it in store. But you don't take it. It ships from their main distribution center. The store is really just a place for you to look and see. I think we've got some companies that are embracing that. Like consumers want to see, they want to look, they want to feel some of these things and touch them. You can lean into that. With a nice combination of your online distribution network and some physical locations have a really efficient system that works for that. If you're looking for companies, what would you want to think about for that type of shopping? Well, not just the retailers, some of which you may or may not be great businesses right now. UPS. How do you get it to your house? It's the delivery, it's the logistics networks. Companies like that I think are going to perhaps benefit as this trend continues and maybe grows."", ""Ricky Mulvey: I'm watching a couple of trends. One of the trends that I'm really interested in is I'll just call this, everyone wants to be Lululemon. There's a movement among those who manufacture goods to be perceived as an athletic brand, a technical brand. Nike is very good at this. I'll note that Under Armour which is like a turnaround stock just now, their new CEO, Stephanie Lenartz, is really interested in bringing out the technical aspect of Under Armour's offerings. She's focusing on footwear. They have this great football boot, which in the United States we call a soccer clique. It's the Magnetic Pro. It's got like a $250 price point. I think more retailers are going to be involved in this trend where the manufacturer or brand which may outsource, obviously its footwear or other clothing is trying to go toward a premium price point, but give you a technical edge that makes you better. Nike and Adidas both have many marathoners who are using their latest technology to promote their shoes in this instance, so that's one trend that's interesting to me. Let's see what happens with it. The other is, I think fast fashion is having a moment again after supply chains broke down in COVID. It seemed like the end of that fast fashion trend. But we've seen the explosion of a new business model in companies like Tamu and Sheehan, which is confidentially filing to go public in the US. Tamu, if you don't know, this is an online version. It's cross between the fast fashion website and Tik Tok."", ""These are influencer-infused models which have thousands of new products that are available every day. Only a few of them are actually produced and the sales are just amazing. Tamu is on track to do $16 billion of revenue this year globally, it was just launched in the US in late 2022. It's sprung from nothing into this business, worth 10s of billions. Sheehan similarly, has sales that are just a huge magnitude, and even Amazon is starting to work with clothing retailers to make sure they don't get left behind in this. We'll see, I'm not sure the long term economics of this business model really hold up. I'm suspect, but it is a fascinating one to watch because it involves a young demographic, which is already savvy with social media. To your point, Deidre is very mobile savvy and isn't really into big-ticket spending items for as low as two bucks on some of these sites. There are little points of pleasure I think for the younger generation, but I just don't know about those unit economics over time."", ""Ricky Mulvey: As always, people on the program may have interest in the stocks they talk about.

GLP-1s have been around since 2005 with Eli Lilly's [INAUDIBLE]. But the newer drugs have set a new bar for weight loss. Novo's drug provides up to 15% weight loss with semaglutide. And then Lilly's drugs in higher doses of tirzepatide can help a person lose more than 20%. So that is really what has started the buzz around the potential drugs."", 'In addition, they could potentially help with heart disease risk and other health issues like liver disease, kidney disease as well. And this has really been what has opened the door to greater insurance coverage potential, which is currently the biggest barrier as insurers worry about the sudden spike in costs for a drug that has a potential market of 50% of the US population. The reality is that the drugs are only used by about 1% of the market right now, projected to be a $100 billion industry by 2030 as you just heard.', ""And then there's the worry that these drugs will also impact food, beverage, and basically everything else from airlines to clothing due to the loss of appetite, addictive snacking, and drinking as well as smaller waist sizes. So the catalyst to the change was Novo Nordisk, which is why we named them company of the year. It's the first time a drug like this has had the potential to impact such a large market.

I've been with the company for more than 30 years. I'm only the fifth CEO in a 100-year-old company. And now we're growing around 30% 100 years into our lifetime. And suddenly, we have brands that are becoming household names. And we've never ever had products that were widely known."", ""ANJALEE KHEMLANI: And Lars Jorgensen also told me that he's not sure the drug will have such drastic impacts on other sectors, but they could move the needle just a little."", ""LARS FRUEGAARD JORGRNSES: My view is that some of those reactions are perhaps a bit exaggerated. But there's no doubt that with the intervention we see now with the GLP-1 based medicines you see significant shift in consumer behavior. And some of these categories will be impacted."", 'ANJALEE KHEMLANI: So all told, the story is just beginning.', 'JULIE HEYMAN: OK. So if it is just beginning, then what should we be looking ahead to in 2024 in this story?', ""ANJALEE KHEMLANI: You definitely have more competitors in line. Eli Lilly nipping at Novo's heels with Zepbound just being approved. We've got Pfizer with its oral option. Lilly also working on an oral option. Roche and Amgen and others getting in or back into the race after having abandoned GLP-1s in the past. So that's really where the things are. But everyone keeps saying that Lilly and Novo are really the market contenders for the year."", ""And you're talking about these two companies already making billions of dollars this year alone. I think Novo made somewhere in the ballpark of $12 billion off of these drugs upgrading guidance three times. So you're looking at a really hot market right now. You have these strong drugs to contend with. And what could potentially be more than that? That's the question that remains. If you already have such improved weight loss, what's next? What else can you do to differentiate yourself in this market?"", ""- Now, Anjalee, you mentioned some barriers. Insurance coverage is one of the needles or another. People don't like needles. You mentioned some oral options in the pipeline, Pfizer, and others. Do we have any timetable on when those might hit?"", ""ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Pfizer saying that their oral option could come out next year. So that's what we're waiting on. We know that it's in late stage trial waiting for a readout early next year. And that's something that analysts are really waiting on. They did have a bit of a setback in their testing looking at a once a day option to move forward rather than their twice a day because there were some issues. So that's really what's on the line for them."", ""And the price, of course, is going to be a differentiator. Right now, if you've seen on your screen before, the monthly price of these drugs is near $1,000 or over $1,000. There it is. $13,000-- $1,300, sorry, for Wegovy per month. And then Zeppelin came in at a bit of a discount to try and compete and convince employers in particular to cover these drugs."", ""So that is one of the things that we're going to have to see is, do all of these factors do the other diseases that it can help, do the reduced prices help insurers say, OK, maybe we do need to cover this?"", ""JULIE HEYMAN: And we're talking in some cases about a lifetime commitment to these drugs. Thank you so much Anjalee Khemlani, appreciate it.""]"

The 112-year-old company has worked to return itself to the cutting edge of today's technology industry."", 'It accomplished this with the purchase of Red Hat and by spinning off a stagnant managed infrastructure business into Kyndryl. Moreover, it accomplished this without alienating a longtime constituency of shareholders. Returning to the cutting edge could also make it a tech stock worth owning. Here are three key reasons why.', 'The aforementioned purchase of Red Hat in 2019 amounted to an ""all-in"" bet on the cloud, costing it $34 billion and dramatically increasing its long-term debt.', 'Fortunately, this gamble seems to have paid off for IBM. Buying Red Hat made the company a leader in the hybrid cloud. Through Red Hat OpenShift, it owns a family of containerization software products that allow entities to link public and private cloud companies more seamlessly.', 'Furthermore, IBM is a player in generative artificial intelligence (AI). Through IBM watsonx, users can combine AI models with generative AI, machine learning, and other tools to accelerate AI workflows. This allows users to create and deploy AI apps, scale AI workloads from a single hybrid-fused data store, and oversee an entire AI lifecycle.', 'Such tools seem to have served IBM well. The company is now the fifth-largest cloud provider in terms of market share. Also, Mordor Intelligence forecasts the cloud industry will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 16% through 2028. With its technology, IBM will likely take a significant portion of what could be a $1.24 trillion industry by 2028.', 'Another area of IBM leadership that may not get enough attention is quantum computing. Quantum computing combines computer science, physics, and mathematics to develop a type of computer that can manage calculations too complicated for more traditional computers.', 'Earlier this month, IBM released the first 127-qubit quantum chip, called Eagle. To put its power into perspective, each qubit doubles the memory space needed for various algorithms, a testament to the exponential increase in computing power that Eagle offers.', ""IBM did not mention quantum computing in its Q3 2023 earnings report, and it received only scant mention on that quarter's earnings call. But with its ability to solve problems, this potential could dramatically boost the stock in the coming years."", 'IBM continues to resemble more conservative stocks in one key area: dividend payments. Despite its struggles in the previous decade, IBM increased its payout 28 years in a row. And even with the cloud stock trading at a five-year high, with its payout of $6.64 per share, the stock offers a dividend yield of 4.1% to new shareholders.', 'Investors will likely see the increases continue. In the first nine months of the year, free cash flow was $5.1 billion, just above the $4.5 billion in dividend costs for the same period.', ""Also, the company has held to a forecast free cash flow of $10.5 billion as it tends to produce more robust free cash flows in the year's final quarter. Thus, IBM can afford this dividend even as it invests to improve its technology."", 'Additionally, investors can purchase this income stream at a reasonable price since IBM stock sells at a P/E ratio of 21. This has increased in recent years, but compared to most of its principal competitors, the stock looks like a compelling bargain.', 'After years of stagnation, IBM finally appears positioned for a recovery. Thanks to improvements in its cloud and quantum computing offerings, the company could attract increasing business.', 'Amid that growth, it remains a compelling dividend stock for income investors. Also, with its rising free cash flow, the dividend increases should continue.', 'Admittedly, its cloud market share may appear small, and quantum computing does not seem to be a major revenue source for now. But as both industries continue to grow, IBM has positioned itself well to reap the benefits for its shareholders.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

Watsonx, a new enterprise AI platform from IBM, looks to fill the same role for the company's AI business."", ""These platforms come with a multiplier effect, as CFO Jim Kavanaugh explained during a recent technology conference. Every $1 of revenue spent on one of IBM's platforms generates between $3 and $5 of additional spending on software, and between $6 and $8 of additional spending on services. IBM has adapted much of its software to run on Red Hat's OpenShift, and its consulting arm steers clients toward its lucrative platforms."", ""While IBM builds solutions for clients around its own platforms, those platforms need to run somewhere. IBM offers its own public cloud computing platform, but it's a small player in an industry dominated by Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. Enterprise customers are going to be biased toward using one or both of those leading platforms. A digital transformation solution that doesn't involve AWS or Azure is likely a non-starter for many of IBM's customers."", ""IBM's consulting business has always been agnostic when it comes to putting together solutions for clients. While IBM sells a wide variety of software, hardware, and services, the company partners with other technology providers and aims to build the best solutions for clients. In the cloud and AI era, this agnosticism is really paying off."", ""IBM has recently entered into a variety of strategic partnerships with leading technology companies, including AWS, Microsoft, Cisco, Oracle, Salesforce, SAP, Adobe, and a few others. IBM competes with these partners in various ways, but it's also happy to include these competing products in the solutions delivered to clients."", ""A solution from IBM may involve migrating workloads to AWS and managing a customer's AWS cloud environment. It could involve deploying SAP's cloud ERP software to Azure, or helping a client move their on-premises Oracle database to Oracle's cloud. OpenShift can run on any cloud, public or private, and a portion of the watsonx platform is already available directly on AWS."", 'These partnerships are now driving a significant number of bookings for IBM. Here\'s Kavanaugh during the technology conference: ""[O]ur strategic partnerships, remember, we came from nowhere, to now, we\'ve got multibillion-dollar book of businesses with AWS, with Microsoft, with SAP, and next up are going to be Salesforce, which we\'re close, and with Oracle and Adobe coming up the rear.""', ""For these technology partners, working with IBM makes a lot of sense. The company has long, deep relationships with enterprise and government clients. IBM's partners want access to that customer base, and through strategic partnerships, IBM can deliver that access while also driving the adoption of its platforms. The end result for IBM is billions of dollars in business that it may not have otherwise won without striking these alliances across the technology industry."", ""Despite an uncertain economic backdrop, IBM's core software and consulting segments are putting up solid results. Software revenue grew by 6% year over year in the third quarter (excluding the impact of currency), and consulting revenue was up 5%. IBM called out Red Hat and strategic partnerships as key drivers of its consulting growth."", ""For the full year, IBM expects revenue to increase by 3% to 5%, and for free cash flow to rise by more than $1 billion from 2022 to $10.5 billion. While the state of the economy will always have an impact on IBM's results, the company's embrace of strategic partnerships is working well in an environment where enterprises are looking to adopt cloud and AI technologies that lower their costs and boost efficiencies."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?', 'Before you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

PEP has been in a good spot, courtesy of strength and resilience in its categories, diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems and robust consumer demand trends, which have been aiding its performance. Robust performances of the global beverage and convenient food businesses have been the key to the company’s growth story. Productivity and cost-saving plans also bode well.PepsiCo continued its robust top and bottom-line surprise trend for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter 2023. Sales and earnings also improved year over year. On an organic basis, revenues grew 8.8% year over year, driven by broad-based growth across categories and geographies.PEP’s core constant-currency earnings improved 16% from the year-ago period, backed by strong top-line growth, as well as the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives. The strong top line resulted from a robust price/mix in the reported quarter.

Accelerated growth in the global beverage and convenient food businesses positions the company for improvement in the near term. This reflects the strength in its diversified portfolio.The company has been a key beneficiary of its presence in the snacking and food category, along with its beverage profile. On a year-over-year basis, organic revenues grew 8% for the global beverage business and 9% for the convenient food business in the third quarter. Region-wise, organic revenues improved 7% and 12%, respectively, in North America and International businesses.In the third quarter, Frito-Lay North America (FLNA) and Quaker Foods North America (QFNA) delivered organic revenue growth of 7% and 5%, respectively. Growth in FLNA was driven by its diversified portfolio, marketplace execution and robust pricing. The business continued to gain from strong category trends, as consumers prefer popular, trusted brands that offer value, convenience and variety. In QFNA, growth was driven by effective pricing actions and higher organic volumes.PepsiCo has been continually focused on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness by driving down costs and plowing back these savings to develop scale and core capabilities. In 2019, the company delivered more than $1 billion in productivity savings, keeping it on track with its goal of generating productivity savings of at least $1 billion annually through 2023.PEP expects to achieve this productivity goal through savings generated from restructuring actions. These actions are likely to position the company to further simplify, synchronize and automate processes; re-engineer the go-to-market and information systems; simplify the organization; and optimize its manufacturing and supply-chain footprint.As part of these restructuring actions, the company estimates incurring pre-tax charges of $2.5 billion through 2023 (with a cash portion of $1.6 billion). Savings from the productivity and restructuring plans should go a long way in driving the top line and margins.PepsiCo’s cost-management initiatives have been aiding margins in third-quarter 2023. On a consolidated basis, the reported gross margin expanded 140 basis points (bps), while the core gross margin expanded 104 bps in the third quarter. The reported operating margin expanded 186 bps from the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the core operating margin expanded 82 bps due to ongoing holistic cost-management initiatives to drive superior supply chain and distribution efficiencies, offset by a double-digit increase in advertising and marketing expenses.PepsiCo raised its core EPS guidance for 2023. The company reaffirms its organic revenue growth prediction of 10% for 2023. It anticipates core constant-currency EPS growth of 13% from the year-ago period’s reported figure. PepsiCo expects a core EPS of $7.54 for 2023, suggesting an 11% increase from the core EPS of $6.79 reported in 2022.PEP also outlined its initial view for 2024.

In this calculation we've used 12%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

Motley Fool Money starts now."", ""It's the Motley Fool Money radio show. I'm Dylan Lewis. Joining me in the studio, Motley Fool Senior Analysts Andy Cross and Ron Gross. Gentlemen, great to have you both here."", 'Andy Cross: Hey, Dylan.', 'Ron Gross: How are you doing, Dylan?', ""Dylan Lewis: We've got the pandemic's enduring impact on households and companies. Some earnings updates from a couple of Fool favorites and, of course, stocks on our radar, but we are kicking off this week with the Big Macro run. First Friday of the month, that means we got a fresh jobs report. What did you see in the numbers?"", ""Ron Gross: The report was a little stronger than expected, meaning more jobs were created, and the unemployment rate actually ticked down to 3.7% from 3.9%. A lot of people are focusing on that number. It's interesting to me. More importantly I think everyone is keeping an eye on wages as a gauge of inflation, and wages were up by 0.4% for the month and 4% from a year ago, so up for the month, but that 4% number is actually not that bad. That is not runaway inflation by any means. That is moderating, which I think people are going to like. I think these numbers actually bode well for a soft landing, and you can quote me, although I very well may be wrong, but I do think these numbers bode well for that. The market was mixed but generally positive on Friday as a result of these numbers, but time will tell."", ""Dylan Lewis: I cannot wait to revisit it about 12 months [laughs] from now and see exactly where we're checking in. We see some uptick in the arms race for generative AI. Andy, we have this week Google parent, Alphabet, publicly launching Gemini, its AI model inside its chatbot. Bard investors seem very happy to see this development, shares up 5% this week on the news. What did you see?"", ""Andy Cross: The timing of all this is very interesting, considering the open AI drama that we're seeing and continue to see in the boardroom. It's this Game of Thrones contest between all of the great challengers, Google, Microsoft. We heard a lot of talk coming from Andy Jassy at Amazon at AWS. This was really interesting because Google has been investing in AI for years and years, and they've just been outrun by OpenAI and Microsoft over the last year. They tried to come out with some Bard fireworks earlier this year. It really flailed. There's just a lot of questions about it. What is their strategy. Clearly, they've been investing and thinking a lot about this. They have all the leaders on board. Sundar Pichai was all about releasing this and doing a very slick video on the leaders and getting together all the different divisions. So it's nice for shareholders and those of us who are really invested into understanding AI. This is actually a really neat development with this Gemini 1.0 in three different phases, the Ultra, the Pro, and the Nano depending on your needs. Dylan, what I'm really excited about this is how they are going to use this at the Enterprise for their clients as they think about the Cloud buy-in with their clients and supporting their clients who are spending more money in the Google Cloud and how those tools and their AI tools are going to drive that usage and encourage more adoption and usage of these tools for the Google Cloud. Overall, very impressive technology. It was very impressive, and we'll see how it all develops over the next few months."", ""Dylan Lewis: You mentioned the Enterprise segment there, Andy, and I think one of the things that's so interesting, this is a nascent space. I think we just lapped the one year anniversary or the one year birthday of OpenAI being out there and available. On the generative AI side, I think one of the things that's very fun about the technology is it's visible. It's something you can interact with and play around with. Is there anything that you're watching or people can keep an eye on as they're interacting with some of this stuff, just to see signs of people maybe taking a lead or developing in the space?"", ""Andy Cross: Let's just focus on the Google part to this. They are talking about how, over the next few months, they're going to start to integrate this into more tools like Search. Now the Pro version is their backbone to Bard search, which has been available for a while, and now it's getting even more enhanced, but you'll start to see this across the entire platform of the tools that we use. Even consumers, let alone clients, or let alone enterprises. You'll start to see more of adoption of these tools into the tools that we use everyday. I'm really interested to see what Apple does because got Siri search and Siri usage and their AI tools there on the consumer side leave a lot to be desired, so it'll be very interesting to see how they innovate in that space. But look for more AI tools integrated throughout the tools like Gmail or whatever you might use as a consumer because that will be a litmus test on how fast this is adopting in the consumer side."", 'Ron Gross: I just got a new iPhone, and it crippled me for a week until I could figure it all out, so I can only imagine what AI has got coming for me.', ""Dylan Lewis: I don't think anyone's pounding the table on Siri's capabilities. I think Siri does leave a lot to be desired, as you were saying there, Andy. From one era of technology to another, we have a curious development over at GameStop. Ron, this week, the meme stock company announced that company cash can be used to invest in public companies by company leadership, Ryan Cohen. I'm a little curious. This sounds like an odd update. Is this an odd update?"", ""Ron Gross: It's an odd update. It's certainly not common, as one esteemed analyst called it, inane and alarming. GameStop should be focusing on turning its business. If they believe in that business, perhaps they should be buying back stock with their cash rather than making other equity investments, but that turnaround is not going well. Recent sales were down 9%, 25% since the same period in 2019. Losses did narrow, I'll give them that. Aggressive cost cuts, store closing in Europe, that helped, but it's certainly not growing the business. It's shrinking the business which, if necessary, so be it, but I guess they're looking for some other ways to generate value. This is tricky. They got to be careful. They could end up violating the Investment Act if more than 40% of their assets are in investments that are unrelated to their actual business. I'm sure their lawyers have informed them, but take it from me that you should be careful and keep an eye on that number."", ""Dylan Lewis: One of the other things I saw related to this update was Ryan Cohen will also be able to invest alongside GameStop personally in anything that he's directing the company to own. It seems to me like so much of the GameStop story is a bet on Ryan Cohen, and we've seen a lot of interest in that. To me this only further solidifies that that is the case here."", ""Ron Gross: I'll remind folks that Ryan and his company is still the largest shareholder of Chewy, largest shareholder of GameStop. He's somewhat famous for the meme craze, trading in and out of GameStop, Bed Bath and Beyond. He's an interesting figure. Disclosure, if he's buying stock along outside a public company, I think everyone needs to know when and how much and why, and if these things are happening behind the scenes, it will not go well."", ""Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, more Chewy. We've got 10 earnings rundown and follow up on last week's Radar Stocks. Stay right here. This is Motley Fool Money."", ""Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis here in the studio with Andy Cross and Ron Gross. We've got an earnings parade and some updates from a couple of different companies that are heavily followed in the Fool universe. Andy, we're going to kick off with DocuSign. It was our colleague, Jason Moser's Radar stock last week. Now we've got some updated earnings. What did you see in the company's results?"", ""Andy Cross: There wasn't a lot baked into the expectations coming in DocuSign. The stock has really struggled here. Decent results showing healthy growth in revenues and a better margin picture, we'll get to that in a second, but billions continue to be on the lower side, and the forecast of low single-digit growth is not super exciting. New CEO Allan Thygesen continues to try to position DocuSign as the leader in both e-signature and more and more about contract life cycle management. He's invested a lot in that, and he continually wants to grow the business above that 10% range. We'll see how it does. Revenue is up 8.5% to 700 million, billings as I mentioned up 5% to 692 million. They added 36,000 customers. That was up 11%. Direct digital continues to be the largest contributor and the direct consumer growth, so just like through the digital platform and directly with DocuSign was up 15%."", ""Steady gross margins at 80%, what you're seeing now with DocuSign is a focus on smart investments. They continue to invest a lot in R&D. Research and development was 19% of sales, that's consistent as for the past couple of quarters. Their operating income was up 27%, their operating margin was 27% versus 23%, cash earnings were 79% versus 57, so you're seeing a lot of investment go into managing the business, driving profits, and driving cash flow. The challenge is that the macro environment is not doing a lot for them right now. They are seeing some of their verticals improving and stabilizing from the first half, especially in things like real estate and some of the other verticals, like technology, but overall, it's no longer the 20% gross story that DocuSign used to be dealing. It's much more about that single to high digit grower, and Thygesen and his team really want to get it back above 10% internationally, a big driver of that, so we'll have to watch what we do. You've basically got a value stock churning at 17 times free cash flow. It can grow in the mid single digits. That's a pretty good deal at this price."", ""Dylan Lewis: It's looking attractive to you, Andy?"", ""Andy Cross: Yeah. I bought a little bit earlier this summer. I'm down a little bit on it, and I think long term you'll do pretty well, and nothing like a fireworks like you may have seen back during the COVID days, of course."", 'Dylan Lewis: Ron, we also have an update on the state of Phyto. [laughs] Head supplier, Chewy, posted earnings this week. This is a stock that bottomed out a bit in 2023. Are there positive signs in their earnings report?', ""Ron Gross: I think if you look under the hood, there are some positive signs. The stock initially got whacked, the investors just did not like what they saw, but the stock rebounded as the week progressed. They did miss on both the top and bottom lines, which I think was that caused that knee jerk reaction, but I'll point out some interesting metrics here. Net sales were up 8%, and management noted that Chewy gained market share during the period, pretty good. Net sales per active customer up nearly 14%. That means their average customer is spending more money on the platform than in previous periods, also important. Auto-ship customer sales were up 13% and now represent over 76% of net sales. You have customers spending more per customer and that recurring revenue is occurring because they're mostly all on auto ship. That can be a powerful combination. They ended the third quarter with about 20.3 million active customers, that is down slightly sequentially from the second quarter. Let's keep an eye on that. But margins did widen. Company reported a loss of around $36,000,000, adjusted EBITDA, if that's your cup of tea, Dylan, [laughs] was $82.1 million positive up $11.7 million. You can maybe take away some things there that at least from a cash flow perspective, not taking stock-based compensation into account. Some things are traveling in the right direction. Adjusted EBITDA margin, 3%, so thin, but there should be some leverage in this business as they continue to grow, and there's room for that. 0.7 times sales from a stock perspective, I'm not a sales ratio kind of guy, but that could indicate some cheapness."", ""Dylan Lewis: Wow, a sales multiple and adjusted earnings numbers, Ron, what's going on over there?"", 'Ron Gross: Anything for our listeners.', ""Dylan Lewis: [laughs] One of the things that jumped out to me in this report was the company really emphasizing its pharmacy business. I think they said it's about to hit a one billion run rate, and they are the number one pet pharmacy in the United States. This is not a particularly old initiative. This is I think in Year 4 or 5 for them. Ron, are you surprised by that?"", ""Ron Gross: It's taken them a while to get to scale, but that doesn't surprise me. I think it would. Pharmacy should be a higher margin business than their typical hard goods segment, so that could bode well for overall margins, overall profitability, and make the growth story even more powerful."", ""Dylan Lewis: From pets to people, shares of Lululemon now at an all time high following the company's latest earnings result. Andy, what is pushing the company so high this week?"", ""Andy Cross: Interestingly after the earnings came out, the pre-market and post-market print was not really inspiring. Now we saw it just hit those all time highs as you mentioned. It continues to be the leader when it comes to not just athleisure, but really high-end apparel. The apparel market in general is not doing that well, but Lululemon continues to do well. Revenue is up 18%, the women's business was up 19%, men up 15%, their accessories up 29%, international was a big driver up more than 49%. North America up 12%, so a little bit on the lower side. Of course it's much more saturated. Their comp sales were up 13%, 9% on the store side, 19% on the e-commerce side. They added 63 new stores over the past year. That's about 17% increase in square footage. Their record Thanksgiving Day sales cycle, the US market share continues to grow. It was up about 1.5 percentage points, and you're seeing improvements on the gross profit and the operating profit side too. Dylan, it's a business that continues to speak to their customer, continues to deliver what those customers want, and those customers are continuing to show willingness to pay for it. Now there was some concern a little bit on the guidance, especially, I think on some of the men's side that maybe men are becoming a little bit more particular about what they may spend on and how much they're willing to spend. I think that was a little bit of concern when we look forward to the growth prospects for the fourth quarter which is sales growth of about 13-14%, but overall this is just a winning business. Their strategy continues to win. They have that new deal with Peloton. That is hopefully going to open up more and more of the market for those who are using Peloton, and that's why the stock is really at an all time high and continues to do well."", ""Dylan Lewis: I don't know if this is a bell weather, but Ron Gross owns two pairs of Lululemon pants and hasn't ever seen a yoga studio. They have golf pants. They've got joggers that don't sleep on the men's side."", ""Andy Cross: Their inventories were down 4%, so it's not a discounting story, they are continuing to sell very high margin product, and their customers are buying it like Ron Gross."", ""Dylan Lewis: I believe they're on your shopping list as well, Andy."", ""Andy Cross: They are on my shopping list. I've been looking for some pants, and it's about time that I stepped up because I've been a little bit more of the discount kind of guy, but I think now Lululemon may be the way to go. My brother uses Lululemon, so he listens to the show there, so Gordon, there you go."", 'Dylan Lewis: We are opening ourselves up to advertising at some point. We may consider Lululemon as a sponsor. We have some host right experience right there for you. How perfect is that? We are going to wrap up our earnings updates in the grocery aisle. JM Smucker up 7% on strong earnings this week. Ron, moms like you continue to choose Jiff even at higher prices.', 'Ron Gross: And Uncrustables, it turns out, it was very strong.', ""Dylan Lewis: This is an interesting story to me and I think it's one investors should maybe take a look at. The stock got whacked back in September on the announcement that they were going to acquire Hostess for $5.6 billion. Perhaps they thought the fit was interesting or they were paying too much, but it created a situation where the stock was perhaps inexpensive. But they've got a great staple of brands, it's folders, and Smuckers, and jiff, and milk bone, it's a family run business. CEO is Fifth Generation Smucker, which is better than Gross. It's an interesting company to me and they're divesting some of their less profitable brands. The quarter, not bad, comp sales up 7%. The Uncrustables was a hot spot there, 22% increase. Sales volume contributed 4%, price contributed 3%, so if you've got both higher volumes and the ability to pass along price increases rather powerful in my opinion. Gross margins widened pretty significantly and profits were strong. They did lower their guidance a little bit of fear about the macro-economy and spending out there. But based on current forward guidance, only 12.5 times forward guidance, they've increased their dividend for 21 consecutive years, 3.8% yield, not too shabby. I do think some risks include, we're moving toward a healthier eating situation. The weight loss drugs are going to be very interesting for companies like Smucker and Hostess, but I do think this is one worth looking at. Andy mentioned earlier that there was a surprisingly good quarter for Lululemon, and we're seeing surprisingly strong results on the grocery aisle as well. Do you feel like the long waited consumer tightening is maybe taking a little bit longer or may or may not materialize, Ron?"", ""Ron Gross: Consumers right now are still in this shying away from big ticket non-discretionary items and focusing on the food items that they need to feed their family. The peanut butters, the jellies, the Uncrustables, and the coffee, which we all desperately can't give that up. That'll be interesting to watch because the consumer, I think, is also taxed. Savings accounts are coming down, credit card balances are going up, this all feeds into this whole big macro thing about is are we going through a recession or a soft landing? But I think stable brands that Smucker owns are going to be good consistently over long periods of time."", ""Dylan Lewis: Ron Gross, Andy Cross, fellows, we're going to catch you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next we've got to look at the business and economic fragility at the COVID pandemic exposed and now we might fix it. Stay right here, you're listening to Motley Fool Money. Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. We're still waiting our way out of the pandemic, but we're now in a position to process and reflect what happened and the response. Journalist and author Bethany McLean has made a career out of sorting through complicated and often calamitous events and her latest book, The Big Fail, takes a look at the last three years, how we responded to COVID, and the lasting effects on households, businesses, and the economy. Motley Fool Money's Deidre Woollard spoke with McLean about her book and the issues she's paying attention to as we head into 2024."", ""Deidre Woollard: In your writing career, one of the things it feels like to me from the outside, reading your books, is you've focused on uncovering the decisions that lead to big outcomes often not the best outcomes. Here some of this was the urgency I think, around the pandemic led to poor decision making. I think that's a theme I've seen in your other books too. I know why I make stupid decisions based on urgency. But why does it happen so much in business, given that we've got information, you've got preparation, and yet when the moment comes, bad mistakes just keep happening."", ""Bethany McLean: I think on some level it's completely understandable. Back to the first question you asked, because when what is inconceivable happens, even if it was always a possibility of which we should have been aware, we're all just shocked. I often say that the best lesson anybody can learn is that when we learned in kindergarten, use your imagination because these things that you think in advance, well, that can't happen, that won't happen too often, they do, whether it's the global financial crisis or the pandemic. They do happen. I forgive everybody, some degree of shock when that happens, but I also think the reality of our system, and it's why I find some of the lessons from the pandemic, they're not just about the pandemic, they're about our society and the way business operates. We've just stretched everything to the breaking point in the name of efficiency, in the name of profits. I think we've forgotten that resiliency matters too. When something unexpected happens, it turns out often that there's not a lot of padding in the system to absorb it, and so people panic in part because of the lack of padding. One thing that exacerbated the panic, one concrete example is we couldn't get PPE because we'd outsourced all the manufacturing of PPE to China. We couldn't just turn on a dime and start manufacturing masks and gowns and all the other things gloves and all the other things we needed here. That's an example of just lack of resiliency as a result of having made things very, very fragile in the name of increased efficiency and profits. There's a cost to that, we forget that there's a cost to that."", ""Deidre Woollard: You have a chapter on the Fed's moves and quantitative easing. There was this line that stuck with me about how the enormity of the Fed's rescue revealed the fragility of our financial system. I think that's a theme throughout the book about the fragility of various systems and just how much the Fed had to prop up everything. I think to the extent that a lot of us are unaware of and you go into detail in the book, but it feels to me, as an observer, the government can't do this indefinitely, but companies assume that it will. Are these short term fixes for long term problems in the financial market as a whole?"", ""Bethany McLean: I think that's so well said and the theme of the book is fragility. Fragility and so many of our systems. But yes, because the Feds stepped in in such a massive way in the spring of 2020, we've all just said, great, the Fed fixed it all, it's not a problem, [laughs] but it really is because every time there's been an issue, whether it's long term capital management, then the global financial crisis, now the pandemic, the Fed has had to step in a bigger and bigger way, really stretching the limits of its power. In some ways, not legally, but in some ways exceeding the bounds of its authority in that the Fed is supposed to be the lender of last resort to the regulated banking system. We all talked a lot about the shadow banking system after the global financial crisis. The shadow banking system got many times bigger, didn't shrink. Most of the Fed's rescue in the spring of 2020 was due to problems in the shadow banking system, which supposedly the reforms after the financial crisis were going to help fix that. The problem is twofold. One is just more of an intellectual issue. Do you want the Fed having to step in, in a bigger and bigger way, in order to fix problems that are supposedly outside the Fed's purview. What does that mean about how fragile our system is? But the more existential question is, what happens if it doesn't work? What happens if the Feds can't, now that everyone expects the Fed can always fix it. What happens if the Fed can't fix it? Then what do we do?"", ""Deidre Woollard: That is a big concern. The other aspect of it too, the paycheck protection program and the PPE, like looking back on that system, certainly we had some of the scandals with large companies, taking money and then giving it back. But do you think large companies, it seems like the funnel of there was broken in terms of being able to get the money to the right places. Is that something that you see has been fixed at all? Or do you think if we end up in a similar situation, again we'll have the same problem of not knowing, it all becomes a black box. We don't know where the money's going."", ""Bethany McLean: I think it is a big problem in an economy that is so tied to the capital markets. The capital markets are just set up. It's innate in the way it's structured, that anything that benefits the capital markets is going to benefit big companies, not small companies and it's going to benefit the rich and not the poor. That's part of the subtitle of our book, who America helps, and who it leaves behind. Because if you have a massive rescue program like the Fed did, then you're going to make borrowing money really cheap for really big companies. But it doesn't do anything for the local restaurant or the small business down the block. You're going to do a lot to increase asset prices for those who own assets, which are the wealthy in our society, but that doesn't do much. In fact, if anything that's negative as inflation sets in for those at the bottom end of the socioeconomic spectrum. We have to think differently in a society where our means of monetary disbursement has been through the Fed. If that's the way it's going to be, then we have to think differently about how that plays out and what that means."", ""Deidre Woollard: Let's talk a little bit about the vaccines because, making a vaccine certainly isn't easy, not always profitable. What happened? It's pretty impressive. But looking at it, one of the things that I was really fascinated by was the different companies and how they are now. Because for like a Pfizer or Johnson and Johnson's, these are big companies and then making a big move. But Moderna, you take a company that was still in start up phase, not really having a product out there. They go from being this minor biotech to now this major player, but now they're on the other side of this. I'm watching it from an investment perspective. I'm really watching what's next for them. What did you learn about it covering it from the journalistic side?"", ""Bethany McLean: I thought the vaccines were actually an inspiring part of the story and perhaps the only one. But there was a recognition on the part of at least some government officials that namely Alexazar who was in the Bush administration and then worked at Eli Lily, and then came back to the Trump administration as the Secretary of Health and Human Services, so the private market was not going to produce a vaccine on its own, at least not on any reasonable time frame. I think that's so important because if you're a rapid believer in the free market, you tend to think the free market will fix everything. We need a vaccine. Companies are going to produce one. No, you have to understand the unique dynamics of every market to understand what may need to be done, what incentives may need to be set. What may need to be done differently. In the case of the vaccines Azar looked at and realized that pharmaceutical industries have grown to hate the vaccine business because it's not profitable. It's not highly profitable because governments are the major buyers. Because too many times they've raced to the rescue to develop vaccines, only to find out their vaccines aren't needed. They've taken a hit in the stock market. Investors have been mad, and they don't have the means to do this really quickly without government help."", ""The government got involved and said, how do we set all the preconditions to make this possible? That was operation warp speed. I think it's a huge testament to how government and the private sector can work together and also to the importance of the rules that govern a market, to really looking at them and understanding, instead of just saying, oh, the free market, we'll take care of it. For Moderna, it's really fascinating. It was a sketchy company and they ran up to the pandemic because they hyped their products a lot or their research a lot, and never produced anything. People were skeptical of them. But then they did come through with a vaccine, obviously. The question is what that means going forward. I've honestly heard both sides of the argument and I'm not sure where I come out. One side of the argument is, mRNA is the future. Now that we've figured out the manufacturing of an mRNA based product, there are so many improvements that can be made and now this opens the door to mRNA as a therapy for all these other diseases. The other argument I've heard is it's not that simple and mRNA is still a trickster. It's going to be more difficult than Moderna is saying. I'm not sure we know the answer to that yet. It's going to be really interesting to see what happens."", ""Deidre Woollard: I want to ask you a specific business related question, because at the Motley Fool, one of the things that our analysts look at is companies buying back stock. You've got this line in the book about Intel saying that, if Intel could reinvest some of the 130 billion it's spent on buybacks in two decades, it would have had a better shot of reclaiming it's former glory. Right now we're in another situation with a lot of buybacks. Do you feel like companies are making a mistake there?"", ""Bethany McLean: Sally I think it's hard. I'm going to give you a nuanced answer because it's really easy to say yes, how terrible they should be taking that money and investing in buildings. But the problem is they haven't seen anything to invest in and so part of the problem the semiconductor manufacturing is TSMC has a huge advantage they can do it much more cheaply. In a world where bottom line profits were the most important thing, of course, everybody was going to outsource more and more to TSMC and even now with the Chips Act, it's really unclear that semiconductors manufactured in America, things are going to be way more expensive. It's unclear that people are going to pay for them. I think it's not as simple as bad company who took all this money and didn't invest in the US. It's that there's been these fundamental changes in our economy such that investing in the US has not seemed like a viable option. But I think we have to look at that and understand what's going on and try to do something to address it because in the end, a country where everything we need is made somewhere else, is speaking of fragility as a pretty fragile place.

Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd, is going to hit you with a question. Ron, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?"", ""Ron Gross: I'm looking at Target TGT it's really interesting to me. As many know, Brian Cornell has been the driving force behind Target past successes, and the current attempt to right size the business. He's been CEO since 2014. He was involved with the acquisition of Shift to boost same day deliveries. Target has definitely been struggling with their inventory mix. They were much too in big ticket items because of COVID. They didn't pivot quickly enough. There was too many discretionary items on the books. They've been working inventory out for quite some quarters now and I think it's looking like they have it somewhat under control. They had a big controversy because of Pride month. A lot of folks boycotted the stores there, I'm hoping that is largely behind them. Shrink does remain a concern as it does with most retailers, theft and other inventory losses. This quarter, a modest revenue beat the operating margins improved dramatically. They've got a 3.3% yield, 52 consecutive years of increases, trading only 14.7 times earnings versus someone like Walmart at 23 times. I think Target, if you're interested in a little bit of a turnaround, is an interesting one to look at."", 'Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about Target.', ""Dan Boyd: Ron, I'm glad you said it was a turnaround play because Target, with all of its shrink problems which were mostly self inflicted and it's just litany of cheap, cheesy crap in its stores doesn't seem like a great investment to me."", 'Andy Cross: Crap being the technical term for lower price merchandise.

It has hundreds of developers every month that are joining its platform. It's a leading flexible Cloud based database, structured software out there. Retention rates very high more than 120%, clients with more than 100,000 annual billings is up 28% the last quarter. Their new search tool, Atlas Vector Search, allows developers to search this data and use it for all those large language models that are driving a lot of AI. The growth rates have been over, say, 40% for the past three years. That has now slowed like many tech companies recent growth has slowed and their guidance for the fourth quarter was 19%. Not super inspiring I think the market was hoping for a little bit better. The stock has more than doubled over the past year, so it's done very well. It's sold off in that news because of some of the so called whisper numbers. We're looking for a little bit higher growth in the fourth quarter. They are now starting to generate some free cash flow. There are adjusted margins, if you start backing out some of that stock comp, pesky stock compensation, they're starting to show profit growth there. It's a $28 billion market cap with $700 million in cash into it. The trick here is it still sees at 17 times sales. A year ago it sold at 8 times sales so much different there.

Target (TGT), for example, closed nine stores nationwide due to theft.', ""Yahoo Finance's Brooke DiPalma reports on this story—breaking down the potential financial impact in the coming year."", 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', '[AUDIO LOGO]', 'SEANA SMITH: We are counting down the top 10 stories of the year here at Yahoo Finance. And coming in at number 6 is retail theft. Target, Walmart, Walgreens, Home Depot all calling out theft as a real threat to their business.', ""MARK MATHEWS: It's a $100-billion problem for our industry as a whole. So it's a big problem."", ""BRAD SMITH: Shrink though, has been one of the common lines and threads that we've been able to draw, unfortunately, through many of these retail earnings this season."", ""MARO CLAXTON: They're in a position now where these type of flash robberies, these smash and grabs or they've been called mobberies are very lucrative and very successful for them."", 'SEANA SMITH: Well, retailers sounded the alarm in 2023 as retail theft climbed in the headlines with giants like Walmart, Target, Home Depot, Nordstrom, and others all mentioning it as an issue. But how much of it is actual theft? Brooke DiPalma joins us now with more on that. Hey, Brooke.', ""BROOKE DIPALMA: Good morning, Seana. Well, inventory shrinkage is really that overarching term that includes the loss of items to retail theft, organized crime, internal theft like employees stealing, errors among other factors. And while retail theft certainly garnered attention across Main Street and Wall Street in 2023, we actually won't know the true financial impact until next year once all retailers' fiscal years have ended. But what we do know now is that in fiscal year 2022, there already was a 1.6% increase accounting for $112.1 billion in losses."", ""Now, previously, it was believed that the majority of that theft was from organized retail groups, but we now know is that the majority of shrink is from both organized retail crime and employee theft. That's followed by errors that make up about 27% of total shrink and unknown or other reasons after that. But retailers have gotten so many questions about what exactly this means for the company's bottom line."", 'Target CEO said earlier this year, there was a 120% increase in the first five months of 2023 involving violence and threats. And that ultimately led to the retail giant closing nine stores in October, blaming theft and organized retail crime for contributing to an unsustainable business performance at those stores. Now, Target expects inventory shrinkage, but mostly theft to cut profits by $500 million in total this year. Meanwhile, at stores that remain open that tend to be hit by theft, Target installed things like locked cases, additional security, and is even training store leaders and employees to combat this.', 'Now, when I went to Walmart\'s annual meeting back in May, CEO Doug McMillon said that, at the time, the company really does prefer to never lock anything up since it really does interfere with customers\' experience. But US CEO John Furner said in a call that shrink has increased a bit both this year and last year, but it remains uneven across the US. Now, Nordstrom CEO said on an earnings call that loss to theft is still an historical high, calling it ""unacceptable.""', 'And at the end of the day, many experts believe that the only way to really solve this issue is for retailers, third-party sellers, those who may have stolen goods then putting them on their platforms, in addition to law enforcement, legislators, well, many believe that they all need to work together. And that will be something that will certainly be looking out for in 2024. Many hoping it happens, but really unclear if it will.']"

Going into 2024, numerous Wall Street pros still expect strong gains from some of the industry’s stronger plays — like RCL, MGM, and WYNN — as they look to continue meeting much of the pent-up demand built during the early days of lockdown.', 'Therefore, let’s check out TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to see how the following leisure plays stack up in the face of turbulent economic conditions.', 'It’s been an incredible 2023 for shares of Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines, which have more than doubled, surging around 147% year-to-date on the back of strengthening demand. Management seems incredibly upbeat following its latest third-quarter beat (adjusted earnings per share of $3.85 coming ahead of estimates), as it hiked its full-year profit guidance.', 'Numerous analysts continue to view the stock favorably, and I think they’re right to do so as bookings demand continues to heat up into the new year despite the macro headwinds.', 'Undoubtedly, robust bookings in the face of a challenged consumer environment may seem quite confusing. Indeed, we may very well be witnessing many consumers looking to meet pent-up demand built during the pandemic lockdown days. Going into the new year, I don’t expect recent bookings strength to cool off, especially if rates fall and consumer confidence gets a bit of a jolt.', 'As demand looks to heat up in 2024, I’d look for the firm to make the most of the upswing by pulling the curtain on new cruise ships. Doing so could give demand an additional shot in the arm. Who wouldn’t be excited to board a brand-new ship with all the amenities?', 'Oppenheimer analyst Ari Wald is upbeat on RCL stock, going as far as to name it one of his best picks to play the space. Many share Wald’s bullishness, with 80% of analysts covering the stock recommending RCL stock as a Buy. I’m inclined to agree with Wald and am staying bullish going into 2024.', 'Royal Caribbean stock comes in as a Strong Buy, with eight Buys and two Holds assigned by analysts in the past three months. The average RCL stock price target of $122.67 entails 2% upside potential.', 'Year-to-date, MGM stock has been a hot performer, now up 30% over the timespan. The casino and hotel firm has come a long way since the dark days of COVID-19 lockdowns. And it doesn’t look like the firm is about to slow the pace of its recovery just because the macro outlook is uncertain in the new year.', 'The casino gaming heavyweight is roaring loudly for investors, with record revenues coming out of Las Vegas. After the latest bounce, I’m inclined to stay bullish while shares continue trading at a discount relative to the peer group. At writing, MGM stock goes for 14.6 times trailing price-to-earnings, well below the resorts & casinos industry average of 24.3 times.', 'With momentum also building in its digital gaming business (BetMGM), the stock seems like one of the most intriguing long-term plays in the leisure space. BetMGM CEO Adam Greenblatt is aware of the stakes (forgive the pun) in the digital gaming arena, and he’s ready to position the firm to remain a worthy rival.', 'My takeaway? Don’t bet against Greenblatt and company as BetMGM looks to gain ground in the new year. At this pace, even a mild landing for the economy may not be enough to drag MGM stock back in the gutter as Vegas and Macau look to flex their muscles in the new year.', 'MGM stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 12 Buys and one Hold rating assigned in the past three months. The average MGM stock price target of $55.25 implies 27.4% upside potential.', 'Wynn Resorts is another casino play that may be overly discounted by Mr. Market at this juncture. The stock has been on the retreat again, now erasing almost all of the year-to-date gains enjoyed in the first quarter of 2023. Despite clocking in a decent recent quarter, investors seem jittery over the softness in its Wynn Macau business.', 'Add wage hikes for the Culinary Workers and Bartenders Union into the equation, and it’s not a mystery as to why the stock has been tough sledding for most of the year. Personally, I believe the recent pessimism is overblown, and I am staying bullish on the stock, just like many analysts covering the name.', 'Despite the rough past quarter, the stock remains attractively valued at just 17.8 times forward price-to-earnings, which is in line with the resorts & casinos industry average of 17.33. As the Macau region recovers further, I do view Wynn shares as a worthy way to play China’s economic rebound.', 'Wynn stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with eight Buys and two Holds given in the past three months. The average WYNN stock price target of $119.17 implies 38.2% upside potential.', 'Leisure stocks continue to win over the confidence of Wall Street analysts. From cruises to casinos, the demand recovery is hard to look past as we move into a new year that may see lower rates and a somewhat more confident consumer.', 'Going into 2024, analysts expect the greatest upside potential (~38%) to be had from WYNN stock. With its large Macau exposure, WYNN definitely seems like the riskiest of the group. That said, higher risk tends to accompany higher rewards.', 'Disclosure']"

And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) share price is up 100% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 81% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 24% , including dividends ."", ""The past week has proven to be lucrative for Visa investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Visa ', 'While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.', ""Over half a decade, Visa managed to grow its earnings per share at 14% a year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 15% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth."", ""The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers)."", 'We know that Visa has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.', 'When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Visa the TSR over the last 5 years was 107%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""It's nice to see that Visa shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 24% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 16% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Visa better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for Visa  you should be aware of."", 'For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.', 'Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.', 'Have feedback on this article?

The proximity of the stock's price to the GF Value line suggests that the market is pricing Snap-on Inc's shares in alignment with its estimated fair value. This alignment can be reassuring to investors, as it implies that the stock is not experiencing extreme overvaluation or undervaluation."", ""The recent insider sell by Aldo Pagliari, along with the broader pattern of insider selling at Snap-on Inc, warrants attention from current and potential investors. While the company's stock appears to be fairly valued based on traditional metrics and the GF Value, insider selling activities can sometimes precede shifts in market sentiment or company performance. Investors should consider these insider transactions as one of many factors in their overall analysis of Snap-on Inc and continue to monitor the company's financial reports, industry trends, and broader market conditions to make informed investment decisions."", 'It is also important to note that insider selling does not always predict negative outcomes. Insiders may have various personal reasons for selling that are unrelated to their outlook on the company. As such, investors should use insider trading data as a supplement to comprehensive fundamental and technical analysis when evaluating investment opportunities in Snap-on Inc or any other company.', ""In conclusion, while the insider selling by Aldo Pagliari may raise some questions, the stock's current valuation and market position should be considered alongside these insider activities.

The worldwide measure of stock performance extended its winning streak for the sixth consecutive session, spurred by the S&P 500's close on Wednesday, which was just 2% shy of its all-time peak, reported Bloomberg. This positive momentum continued to propel upward during Thursday's Asian futures trading. Noteworthy milestones were achieved by Apple Inc., reaching a historic high, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, also attaining record levels. The Federal Reserve's dot plot, which serves as a visual representation of policymakers' interest rate projections, revealed a signal of potential 75 basis points in cuts over the next year. This disclosure triggered a noteworthy retreat in the value of the dollar, further influencing the positive market sentiment. As the financial landscape adapts to the evolving economic dynamics, investors have been closely monitoring the Federal Reserve's signals for insights into its policy direction. The anticipation of interest-rate cuts has not only fueled the rally in stocks but has also had a notable impact on the bond market, contributing to the overall surge in bond prices.

In November, inflation dropped to 2.4%, prompting heightened expectations for ECB rate cuts in 2024, especially after a comment from board member Isabel Schnabel.

However, despite its commendable operational performance, Oppenheimer made a strategic decision to remove Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) from its mid/large cap top pick listing for 2024.

Indeed, Managed Medicaid penetration has increased from 25% of total Medicaid spend in 2010 to 60% today, and we expect further gains over time. In Marketplace, growth is driven by the trend toward more individuals buying health insurance. Centene holds the #1 market share in both of these programs and is well positioned to capitalize on their continued growth. The stock trades for 10x consensus 2024 EPS, but this doesn’t tell the whole story. Past missteps in Centene’s Medicare business will result in that segment losing $0.80 per share next year. We believe Centene can turn Medicare around and generate positive earnings in the next few years. This could increase EPS by more than $1 per share and reduce the P/E ratio to just 8.5x.

So, too, are Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, which are the other brands that Tapestry (NYSE: TPR) owns. The company is dedicated to the high end of the market. And that's why the decision to start selling Coach bags on Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) sounds so surprising."", 'But is it?', ""Coach is a storied brand with a great history and name recognition. It's the foundation of Tapestry's business, making up roughly 75% of the company's sales. The retailer's other two nameplates, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman, accounted for the rest of the top line."", ""But Tapestry isn't happy with where it is and wants to get even bigger. To that end, the company recently agreed to buy peer Capri Holdings (NYSE: CPRI), which owns the Versace, Jimmy Choo, and Michael Kors nameplates. The cost of this transaction, which is all cash, is $8.5 billion."", ""Even after this deal, however, Coach will remain the most important brand in the portfolio. Michael Kors is Capri's largest nameplate, with sales of $879 million in the fiscal second quarter of 2024. By comparison, the Coach business produced sales of $1.16 billion in the comparable quarter, or nearly 33% more than Michael Kors."", ""It's also worth highlighting that, of the three brands Tapestry owns, only Coach was able to increase sales year over year in the fiscal first quarter of 2024. All three of the brands owned by Capri experienced sales declines in the comparable quarter. The important takeaway is that Coach is the big winner for Tapestry right now."", 'Which is why it might seem odd that Tapestry began selling Coach bags on Amazon in September. That is decidedly different from the high-end experience that the company is trying to create in its stores. In fact, it would seem like a material step down for a luxury retailer to start selling anything on a platform like Amazon.', ""Selling through an online version of the Coach store makes sense, but through another company's online store not so much. That's particularly true since one of Amazon's strengths is offering a large variety of low-cost products, which probably includes Coach knockoffs."", ""Tapestry is really attempting to do something that it hasn't necessarily had to do before. Coach has a storied history, for sure, but younger generations of shoppers don't shop the same way that Coach's historical customer base shopped."", ""The company was very clear during its earnings conference call on what it was attempting to do, noting that Amazon is often an important step in a consumer's discovery process. And more to the point, that's particularly true for younger shoppers."", ""If the brand isn't there when a potential customer starts looking for a bag, it may never have the chance to turn that potential customer into an actual customer."", ""Yes, there's a risk that the Coach brand's image is diminished by selling on Amazon. But the upside potential of reaching the next generation of shoppers where they're shopping offers huge potential."", ""It seems unlikely that Tapestry will end up selling everything Coach offers through this channel, and it might even end up creating exclusive products for Amazon, as it does for its own outlet stores. So investors probably shouldn't get too worried about the experiment. Even if the Amazon effort fails, the harm is likely to be minimal."", 'However, if selling Coach bags on Amazon is a success, the upside could be huge. Drawing new customers, potentially an entire generation of new customers, into the brand would expand the market for Coach.', ""And Tapestry could also start selling other brands on the platform as well, perhaps breathing new life into brands that aren't resonating as well with younger consumers. Add in the Capri Holdings acquisition, and there's notable potential to improve the future prospects of this high-end retailer."", ""Selling Coach through Amazon is a test, and it's probably only going to be a small part of the overall business even if it is successful."", ""That said, it's worth monitoring over the near term. Mercurial consumers are a big factor for fashion-oriented brands, and trying to be where customers are shopping is an interesting effort for Tapestry, even if it seems out of step with the history of the Coach brand."", 'A win here could lead to more interesting outside-the-box efforts at Tapestry as it looks to step up its game in the luxury space.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Tapestry right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Tapestry, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Tapestry wasn't one of them.

Should Nvidia meet its $20 billion guidance for Q4 and deliver a similar profit margin as in Q3, then repeat the quarter in Q1, Nvidia would have about $35.8 billion in net income.', ""If you divide its market cap by that figure, you'd get a forward earnings valuation of 33, which isn't so bad."", 'So, the stock should look reasonably priced once Nvidia completes a full year with this elevated business.

I'd like to see the company lap one year of accelerated business before investing in the stock again, as I sold my shares earlier this year after a strong gain (a big mistake on my part). However, if Nvidia is an outsized part of your portfolio, I would consider trimming the stock a bit, as it could be a dramatic fall from grace if demand goes away in 2024."", ""So, could Nvidia hit $600 in 2024?

Shares of both companies are up 34% so far this year, but it won't be surprising to see them step on the gas in 2024 and deliver much stronger gains as AI starts having a stronger influence on their businesses."", ""Let's look at the reasons why these two tech stocks seem set for a bull run."", ""Foundry giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC, is playing a central role in the growing adoption of AI. That's because the world's leading AI chipmaker, Nvidia, sources its AI chips from TSMC."", ""Nvidia is a fabless semiconductor company, which means that it only designs and sells the chips -- manufacturing is outsourced to foundries such as TSMC. It is worth noting that the booming demand for Nvidia's AI chips is positively impacting TSMC's business as well, as the former is placing more orders to meet the booming end-market demand. This explains why the Taiwan-based company saw a big surge in monthly revenue in October, snapping a seven-month streak of sales declines."", 'TSMC witnessed a drop in sales and earnings in 2023 on account of weakness in key markets such as smartphones and personal computers. AI chips, however, have been a bright spot for the company. This is evident from the growth in the sales of chips manufactured by TSMC on its 5-nanometer (nm) manufacturing node.', ""TSMC got 37% of its third-quarter 2023 revenue of $17.3 billion from selling 5nm chips, which equates to $6.4 billion. That was an increase of 14% from the year-ago period when 5nm chips accounted for 28% of its total revenue of $20.2 billion. For comparison, TSMC's Q3 revenue was down almost 15% year over, indicating that AI is already a catalyst for its business."", 'This catalyst is set to become bigger for TSMC in 2024 for a couple of reasons. First, the company is working to substantially increase its advanced chip packaging capacity. On its October earnings conference call, CEO C.C. Wei remarked that the company will more than double the capacity of its advanced packaging technology, known as CoWoS (chip-on-wafer-on-substrate), to meet the surging customer demand.', ""The company plans to increase CoWoS packaging capacity in 2025 as well. That's not surprising as this technology allows chipmakers to place multiple chiplets and memory in a single package, allowing chipmakers to extract more power and efficiency that are critical for training AI models. So, the increase in CoWoS packaging capacity should allow TSMC to fulfill more orders from the likes of Nvidia next year."", ""What's more, Nvidia is expected to adopt TSMC's 3nm architecture in 2024 for making its next-generation graphics cards. All this explains why analysts are anticipating TSMC's fortunes to turn around in 2024. The company's revenue is anticipated to drop 9% in 2023 to $69 billion, but it is expected to deliver almost 20% revenue growth for the next couple of years."", 'If TSMC does hit $99 billion in revenue in 2025 and it can maintain its five-year average sales multiple of 8.5 at that time, its market cap could jump to $841 billion in a couple of years. That would be a 60% jump from current levels. With TSMC stock trading at 7.6 times sales right now, investors can buy it at a relatively cheaper valuation, and they may not want to miss this opportunity given the potential upside it could deliver.', 'Snowflake operates a cloud-based data platform that is used by its customers to consolidate data, and then use that data to build applications and gain business insights, among other things. Snowflake, therefore, is going to be another key in the proliferation of AI as large language models (LLMs) are trained using huge amounts of data to develop popular applications such as ChatGPT.', ""Not surprisingly, Snowflake CEO Frank Slootman remarked on the company's November earnings conference call:"", ""Generative AI is at the forefront of customer conversations, which in turn drives renewed emphasis on data strategy in preparation of these new technologies. We said it many times: There's no AI strategy without a data strategy. The intelligence we're all aiming for resides in the data, hence the quality of that underpinning is critical."", 'In simpler words, the quality of data by which AI models are trained will dictate the accuracy of the results that they deliver.', 'Snowflake is looking to capitalize on the need for quality data by encouraging more of its large and growing customer base to share data through its data-sharing architecture. The company says that 28% of its 8,900-strong customer base is sharing data, up from 22% in the year-ago quarter, when it reported\xa0\xa0a customer base of 7,200.', 'The company is also offering other AI-related services, such as a fully managed service -- known as Cortex -- to help companies analyze proprietary data and build AI apps. Snowflake customers can summarize documents, extract information, and translate text, among other things, using the Cortex platform without having to invest in expensive hardware.', 'More importantly, Snowflake is looking to push the envelope by developing new AI-related services. One of these is Document AI, which will enable organizations to turn unstructured documents into semi-structured documents and use them for further analysis.', 'In all, the growing importance of quality data thanks to the adoption of generative AI is going to be a tailwind for Snowflake and help accelerate the impressive growth the company is already delivering.', 'The company recently raised its full-year product revenue outlook thanks to an improvement in customer spending. Snowflake is expected to exit fiscal 2024 (which will end in January 2024) with a 35% spike in revenue to $2.79 billion, followed by healthy growth in the next couple of years as well.', ""Investors, however, may be wondering if Snowflake stock is worth buying at a rich 24 times sales. The good news is that Snowflake's top line has headed substantially higher in the past year and its sales multiple has remained the same."", ""With a potential acceleration in growth thanks to new catalysts such as AI, investors would do well to buy the stock right now as it has gained robust momentum following Snowflake's latest results and could go on a sustained bull run."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Snowflake right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Snowflake wasn't one of them.

Wall Street strategists expect that momentum to accelerate in the fourth quarter, and the prospect of another round of strong financial results is just one of the factors pushing the S&P 500 toward a record high, which would usher in a new bull market.', 'So what? The S&P 500 has often produced triple-digit returns during past bull markets, so many stocks would likely skyrocket during the next one. Investors looking for ways to capitalize on that upswing should consider the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks, a group of seven megacap tech stocks that have historically created tremendous wealth for shareholders.', 'The components of the Magnificent Seven are listed alphabetically below. Beside each is the median 12-month price target among Wall Street analysts, and the implied upside from the current price.', 'Alphabet: $154 per share (16% upside)', 'Amazon: (NASDAQ: AMZN): $175 per share (21% upside)', 'Apple: $200 per share (3% upside)', 'Meta Platforms: $382 per share (17% upside)', 'Microsoft: $414 per share (12% upside)', 'Nvidia: (NASDAQ: NVDA): $650 per share (39% upside)', 'Tesla: $256 per share (7% upside)', ""Wall Street is forecasting upside for all the Magnificent Seven stocks, but none more so than Nvidia and Amazon. In other words, analysts see those stocks as the best buys of the bunch right now. Here's what investors should know."", 'Nvidia reported stunning financial results in the third quarter. Total revenue soared 206% year over year to $18.1 billion on record data center sales supercharged by interest in artificial intelligence (AI). Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income jumped sixfold to $10 billion as high-margin software and services accounted for more of total revenue.', 'Yet, Nvidia has hardly tapped its $1 trillion addressable market, and the investment thesis remains quite compelling: Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard in accelerated computing, a discipline that uses specialized hardware to speed up complex data center workloads. In fact, the company holds a 90% market share in workstation graphics processors, and an 80% to 95% market share in machine learning chips, according to analysts.', 'That last point is particularly salient. It means Nvidia dominates the AI hardware market, and that alone puts the company in a winning position. But Nvidia is truly formidable because it has a complementary ecosystem of AI software and services. DGX Cloud brings those product together, providing businesses with on-demand access to the supercomputing infrastructure, software, and pre-trained models needed to build and deploy AI applications.', 'In short, Nvidia has the best AI hardware on the market, and DGX Cloud makes its products more widely accessible than ever before. To quote Argus analyst Jim Kelleher, ""Nvidia stands out, in our view, not only because it participates in so many parts of the dynamic AI economy, but because it has synthesized its offerings into a first-of-its-kind AI-as-a-service delivered through the cloud.""', 'With that in mind, the AI market is projected to expand at 37% annually through 2030, and Nvidia should be a major (if not the biggest) beneficiary. Indeed, Morningstar analysts expect the company to grow revenue at 22% annually over the next decade. That forecast makes its current valuation of 25.8 times sales look relatively reasonable.', 'There is no guarantee that Nvidia shareholders will see 39% gains over the next year. But patient investors who can withstand volatility should feel comfortable buying a few shares today, provided they plan to hold the stock for at least five years.', 'Amazon reported solid third-quarter financial results. Revenue increased 13% to $143 billion on particularly strong momentum in retail and advertising, and generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income tripled to reach $9.9 billion as the company continued to make progress on expense management.', 'Amazon rewarded shareholders with year-to-date returns of 74%, but the company has three tailwinds at its back that leave plenty of upside for investors.', 'First, Amazon is synonymous with e-commerce, as evidenced by its 39% market share in online retail sales across Western Europe and North America. That scale creates a powerful network effect, and Amazon reinforced that virtuous cycle with adjacent logistics services that simplify fulfillment for merchants.', 'Second, Amazon rolled its success in retail into a strong presence in the digital advertising market. Indeed, the company accounts for 75% of U.S. retail media spend, which is 10 times the market share held by its closest competitor, and it ranks as the third-largest ad tech company in the world. That success arises from its ability to engage consumers and source shopper data from its marketplace, so Amazon should continue to thrive in digital advertising for as long as it remains a leader in e-commerce.', ""Third, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services, holding nearly as much market share as Microsoft Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud Platform combined. Of particular note, AWS has the broadest and deepest set of AI services in the cloud, and consultancy Gartner recently recognized the company as a leader in cloud AI developer services."", ""Here's how that shakes out: Online retail sales are forecasted to grow at 8% annually through 2030, while the digital advertising and cloud computing markets are projected to grow at 10% annually and 17% annually, respectively, through 2032. That gives Amazon a good shot at low-double-digit revenue growth over the next decade, with a possible upside if AI products like Bedrock really take off."", ""In any case, that forecast makes Amazon's current valuation of 2.7 times sales look cheap. There is no guarantee shareholders will see 21% gains in the next year, but patient investors willing to hold this Magnificent Seven stock for the next five years can confidently buy a small position today."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.5% over the forecasted period and reach $3.02 trillion by 2032. The market growth can be attributed to the increased GDP contribution, resulting in higher assets, property, and commercial activities. The rise in GDP leads to an increased demand for property and casualty insurance products including property, liability, and business interruption coverage. Growing urbanization is another key factor fueling the growth of the market. The demand for property and casualty insurance coverage is expected to increase due to a surge in people migrating to cities. The expansion of urban infrastructure can lead to risks such as higher traffic congestion, property thefts, and natural disasters, thereby increasing the demand for property and casualty insurance.', 'One of the major trends in the market is data analytics to enhance underwriting, claims processing, and risk assessment.

This is Mickey Mouse. This is exciting because it’s kind of symbolic,"" said Jennifer Jenkins, a professor of law and director of Duke’s Center for the Study of Public Domain, who writes an annual Jan. 1 column for “Public Domain Day.” ”I kind of feel like the pipe on the steamboat, like expelling smoke. It’s so exciting.""', ""U.S. law allows a copyright to be held for 95 years after Congress expanded it several times during Mickey's life."", '“It’s sometimes derisively referred to as the Mickey Mouse Protection Act,” Jenkins said. “That’s oversimplified because it wasn’t just Disney that was pushing for term extension. It was a whole group of copyright holders whose works were set to go into the public domain soon, who benefited greatly from the 20 years of extra protection.”', '“Ever since Mickey Mouse’s first appearance in the 1928 short film Steamboat Willie, people have associated the character with Disney’s stories, experiences, and authentic products,"" a Disney spokesperson said in a statement to The Associated Press. ""That will not change when the copyright in the Steamboat Willie film expires.""', 'Current artists and creators will be able to make use of Mickey, but with major limits. It is only the more mischievous, rat-like, non-speaking boat captain in “Steamboat Willie” that has become public.', ""“More modern versions of Mickey will remain unaffected by the expiration of the Steamboat Willie copyright, and Mickey will continue to play a leading role as a global ambassador for the Walt Disney Company in our storytelling, theme park attractions, and merchandise,” Disney's statement said."", ""Not every feature or personality trait a character displays is necessarily copyrightable, however, and courts could be busy in the coming years determining what's inside and outside Disney's ownership."", '“We will, of course, continue to protect our rights in the more modern versions of Mickey Mouse and other works that remain subject to copyright,” the company said.', 'Disney still solidly and separately holds a trademark on Mickey as a corporate mascot and brand identifier, and the law forbids using the character deceptively to fool consumers into thinking a product is from the original creator. Anyone starting a film company or a theme park will not be free to make mouse ears their logo.', 'Disney\'s statement said it ""will work to safeguard against consumer confusion caused by unauthorized uses of Mickey and our other iconic characters.”', '“Steamboat Willie,"" directed by Walt Disney and his partner Ub Iwerks and among the first cartoons to have sound synced with its visuals, was actually the third cartoon featuring Mickey and Minnie the men made, but the first to be released. It features a more menacing Mickey captaining a boat and making musical instruments out of other animals.', 'In it, and in a clip from it used in the introduction to Disney animated films in recent years, Mickey whistles the 1910 tune “Steamboat Bill.” The song inspired the title of the Buster Keaton film “ Steamboat Bill Jr,” released just a few months before “Steamboat Willie,” which in turn may have inspired the title of the Disney short. The copyright wasn’t renewed on the Keaton film and it’s been in the public domain since 1956.', ""Another famous animal sidekick, Tigger, will join his friend Winnie the Pooh in the public domain as the book in which the bouncing tiger first appeared, “The House at Pooh Corner,” turns 96. Pooh, probably the most celebrated prior character to become public property, took on that status two years ago when A.A. Milne's original “Winnie the Pooh” entered the public domain, resulting in some truly novel uses, including this year's horror film “Winnie The Pooh: Blood and Honey.”"", 'Young Mickey could get the same treatment.', '“Now, the audience is going to set the terms,” said Cory Doctorow, an author and activist who advocates for broader public ownership of works.', 'Jan. 1, 2024, has long been circled on the calendars of public domain watchers, but some say it serves to show how overlong it takes for U.S. works to go public, and many properties with less pedigree than Winnie or Minnie can disappear or be forgotten with their copyrights murky.', '“The fact that there are works that are still recognizable and enduring after 95 years is is frankly remarkable,” Doctorow said. “And it makes you think about the stuff that we must have lost, that would still have currency.”', ""Other properties entering the U.S. public domain are Charlie Chaplin’s film “Circus,” Virginia Woolf’s novel “Orlando” and Bertolt Brecht's musical play “The Threepenny Opera.”"", 'The current copyright term passed in 1998 brought the U.S. into closer sync with the European Union, making it unlikely Congress would extend it now. There are also now powerful companies, including Amazon with its fan-fiction-heavy publishing arm and Google with its books project, that in some cases advocate for the public domain.', '“There’s actually more pushback now than there was 20 some years ago when the Mickey Mouse act was passed,” said Paul Heald, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law who specializes in copyright and international intellectual property law.', 'In some instances, the U.S. goes well beyond Europe, and maintains copyright on work that is already public in its country of origin, though international agreements would allow the U.S. to adopt the shorter term of other nations on work produced there.', 'The books of George Orwell for example, including “Animal Farm” and “1984,” both published in the 1940s, are now public domain in his native Great Britain.', '“Those works aren\'t going to fall into the public domain in the United States for 25 years,"" Heald said. ""It would be literally costless for Congress to pass a law saying, ‘we now adopt the rule of the shorter term,’ which would throw a butt ton of works into the public domain over here.”', '___', ""This story has been corrected to reflect that Eugene O'Neill's play “Long Day's Journey Into Night” is not yet entering the public domain.""]"

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', ""Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements."", 'Is DIS Worth Investing In?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Disney, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 3.8% over the past month to $4.38.', ""Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for Disney.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Exelon, it has a TSR of 43% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!', ""While the broader market gained around 17% in the last year, Exelon shareholders lost 4.6% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 7% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Exelon better, we need to consider many other factors.

The company has reported net profit in 5 years out of the past 10 years."", ""To ensure the sustainability of dividends, a company must have robust growth metrics. Devon Energy Corp's growth rank of 6 out of 10 suggests that the company has a fair growth outlook."", ""Revenue is the lifeblood of any company, and Devon Energy Corp's revenue per share, combined with the 3-year revenue growth rate, indicates a strong revenue model. Devon Energy Corp's revenue has increased by approximately 23.70% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 74.94% of global competitors."", ""The company's 3-year EPS growth rate showcases its capability to grow its earnings, a critical component for sustaining dividends in the long run. During the past three years, Devon Energy Corp's earnings increased by approximately 97.40% per year on average, a rate that outperforms approximately 90.72% of global competitors."", ""In conclusion, Devon Energy Corp's consistent dividend payments, robust dividend growth rate, manageable payout ratio, fair profitability, and solid growth metrics paint a promising picture for value investors seeking reliable income streams. The company's ability to maintain a healthy balance between rewarding shareholders and reinvesting in its business operations is a testament to its strategic financial management. As the energy sector continues to evolve, Devon Energy Corp's adaptability and financial discipline may serve as a foundation for future dividend stability and growth. Investors considering adding DVN to their portfolios should weigh these factors alongside their individual investment goals and risk tolerance."", 'GuruFocus Premium users can screen for high-dividend yield stocks using the High Dividend Yield Screener.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Reported EPS is $1.34, expectations were $1.32.', ""Operator: Good afternoon. My name is Emma, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Oracle Corporation's Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Ken Bond, you may begin your conference."", ""Ken Bond: Thank you, Emma. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's second quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website. Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from our Investor Relations website. On the call today, our Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison, and Chief Executive Officer, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking."", ""Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q, and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock. And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events."", ""Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra."", ""Safra Catz: Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. We had another great quarter. When you look at the top of our financial results table, a few things are very clear. The largest number, cloud services and license support, is now 74% of the revenue, and it's recurring revenue, and it's the one growing by $1 billion this quarter. The smaller numbers, which are not recurring, now account for only 26%. This is exactly what we told you would happen, and it's happening. And as this continues, total revenue growth will accelerate every year. To that point, OCI is now one of the clear drivers of our acceleration. Imagine just three years ago, OCI was rarely, if ever, mentioned as a viable hyperscale alternative. Of course, we knew what we had built and we kept talking about it and we knew it was only a matter of time."", ""And now, more industry analysts are catching on to what customers are choosing. For example, just last week, we were recognized as a leader in the 2023 Gartner Magic Quadrant for Strategic Cloud Platform Services. Our financial results reflect that customers have figured out that by moving to OCI, they really can get more while paying less. On top of that, we are now the default choice for AI workloads given our unique differentiation and price performance capabilities. Why specifically are they coming to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure? Well, it's a combination of several things. Creating the second generation cloud enabled us to build a much better, more scalable, and more efficient cloud. We understood the limitations of the first generation and engineered very differently."", 'Second, we know what it takes to run at enterprise scale, performance and security better than, I say, anyone else. Our 45-year history as the leading enterprise software company gives us unique knowledge of what exactly is required to run mission critical systems. Third, we recognize that customers need deployment flexibility rather than just offer public cloud services like our competitors, we are the only vendor which also offers dedicated cloud to customer, dedicated region, sovereign clouds, and Alloy, our partner clouds. And then finally, our belief in the importance of multi-cloud offerings will be industry changing as these collaborations roll out. With all this success and exploding demand, we are working as quickly as we can to get the cloud capacity built out.', ""Now, to the Q2 results. With total revenue at the midpoint of my constant currency guidance and the EPS at the high end of guidance. Now, as a reminder, currency was 1 point less helpful than when we gave guidance three months ago. Total cloud revenue, that's SaaS plus IaaS, excluding Cerner, was $4.1 billion, up 25%. Including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 24% at $4.8 billion, with IaaS revenue at $1.6 billion, up 50%, and SaaS revenue of $3.2 billion, up 14%. Total cloud services and license support revenue for the quarter was $9.6 billion, up 11%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, autonomous database, and our Gen 2 OCI. Application subscription revenues, which includes support, were $4.5 billion, up 9%. Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have an annualized revenue of $7.1 billion and we're up 19%."", 'Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support, were $5.2 billion, up 12%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 50%. Excluding legacy hosting services, Gen 2 infrastructure cloud services revenue grew 55%, with an annualized revenue of $6 billion. OCI consumption revenue was up 71%. Database subscription revenues, which includes database license support, were up 4%, highlighted by Exadata database cloud services revenue, which was up 40%, and autonomous database up 26%. Very importantly, as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be the third leg of revenue growth alongside strategic SaaS and Gen 2 OCI. Software license revenues were $1.2 billion, down 19% in a tough comparison to last year where it was up 23%.', 'So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $12.9 billion, up 4% including Cerner, actually up 6% excluding Cerner. Now shifting to margins, the gross margin for cloud services and license support was 78%. This is because of the mix between support and cloud in which cloud is growing much faster than support. Support and SaaS margins are consistent with last year, while IaaS gross margins improved substantially. While we continue to build data center capacity, gross margins go higher as these new cloud regions fill up. We monitor these expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale. To this point, the gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 10% in Q2. Non-GAAP operating income was $5.5 billion, up 7% from last year.', 'The operating margin was 43%, up from 41% last year. As we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud and drive Cerner profitability to Oracle standards, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also expand the operating margin. The non-GAAP tax rate for the quarter was 19% and non-GAAP EPS was $1.34 in USD, up 11% in USD, and up 9% in constant currency. GAAP EPS was $0.89 in USD. At quarter-end, we had nearly $8.7 billion in cash and marketable securities and the short-term deferred revenue balance was $8.9 billion, up 1%. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $17 billion, up 13%. And free cash flow was $10.1 billion, up 20%. Capital expenditures were $6.9 billion over the same period as we continue to seek cash flow benefit from our cloud transformation.', ""Our remaining performance obligation, or RPO, is now over $65 billion, with the portion excluding Cerner up 11% in constant currency. We continue to sign large deals with many in the pipeline. Approximately 48% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. CapEx was $1.1 billion in Q2 as we continue to build capacity for bookings and our customers' growing needs. Given the enormity of our pipeline and backlog, I expect CapEx will be somewhere around $8 billion this fiscal year, meaning our second half CapEx will be considerably higher as we bring online more capacity. To that point, we now have 66 customer facing cloud regions live, with 45 public cloud regions around the world and another six being built. 12 of these public cloud regions interconnect with Azure and starting next year, customers will be able to run Oracle Database at Azure on OCI inside Azure."", ""We also have 10 dedicated regions live and 13 more planned, nine national security regions, and two EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each. And finally, we have seven Alloy cloud regions planned where Oracle partners become cloud providers offering customized cloud services alongside the Oracle Cloud. And of course, we also have so many, many, many clouded customer installations. The sizing flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be advantages for us in the marketplace. Finally, as we've said before, we're committed to returning value to our shareholders through technical innovation, strategic acquisition, stock repurchases, prudent use of debt, and a dividend. This quarter, we repurchased 4 million shares for a total of $450 million."", 'And in addition, we paid out dividends of $4.1 billion over the last 12 months. And the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.40 per share. Now let me turn to my guidance for Q3, which I will review, as always, on a non-GAAP basis. If currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have little effect on total revenue and EPS. However, the actual currency impact may be different. So because of that, all the numbers I give you are the same for constant currency and USD. Total revenues, including Cerner, are expected to grow from 6% to 8%. Total revenues excluding Cerner are expected to grow from 8% to 10%. Total cloud revenue excluding Cerner is expected to grow from 26% to 28%. Non-GAAP EPS growth is expected to grow between 10% and 14% and be between $1.35 and $1.39.', 'My EPS guidance for Q3 assumes a base tax rate of 19%. However, one-time tax events could cause actual tax rates to vary. Finally, I remain firmly committed to our fiscal ‘26 financial goals for revenue, operating margins, and EPS growth. And with that, let me turn it over to Larry for his comments.', ""Larry Ellison: Thank you, Safra. The demand for Oracle's Cloud Infrastructure and Generative AI is consistently increasing quarter after quarter. Oracle's total remaining performance obligations, or RPO, has now reached $65 billion, slightly more than our annual revenue. In response to this sharply increasing demand, Oracle is in the process of expanding 66 of our existing cloud data centers and building 100 new cloud data centers. We have to build 100 additional cloud data centers because there are billions of dollars more in contracted demand than we currently can supply. Cloud Infrastructure demand is huge and growing at an unprecedented rate. In the next few weeks, we expect to sign a couple more billion dollar Cloud Infrastructure contracts."", ""Gartner recently named Oracle OCI as a leader in cloud platform and infrastructure services. The demand for Cloud Infrastructure services and new Oracle cloud data centers is broad-based, driven not only by Generative AI customers, but also by nation states buying sovereign Oracle cloud data centers, plus large banks, telecommunications companies, and industrial companies, buying dedicated cloud data centers, dedicated Oracle cloud data centers, and perhaps most interestingly, demand from other hyperscalers and other cloud service providers, co-locating and connecting their clouds with Oracle cloud data centers. Customers don't want clouds to be walled gardens. In the next few months, we will turn on 20 new Oracle cloud data centers, co-located with and connected to Microsoft Azure as a part of our joint multi-cloud initiative."", ""These 20 new multi-cloud data centers will house over 2,000 full racks of Exadata database machines designed to meet pent-up demand for the Oracle cloud database. We're able to build new data centers rapidly and operate them inexpensively because all of our data centers are architecturally identical, highly automated, with an identical high-performance RDMA network, autonomous services, and applications. Oracle cloud data centers vary only by scale. Again, several nation states have ordered multiple sovereign data centers to be built within their country so that they can move their government, healthcare, and commercial workloads to the Oracle cloud. These new countries include Japan, Italy, Saudi Arabia, Bangladesh, New Zealand, and others."", ""Some of the world's largest banks, telecommunications and industrial companies, have also contracted with us to build Oracle cloud data centers dedicated entirely to them so that they can migrate their workloads to an Oracle cloud data center. These companies include Nomura, Vodafone, Telecom Italia Mobile, Saudi Telecom, a huge Korean conglomerate, and a huge US defense contractor. These are but a few examples that demonstrate the diversity of the growing demand for Oracle's highly differentiated Gen2 cloud infrastructure and data center technology. Back to you, Ken."", 'Ken Bond: Thank you, Larry.

But it has soared 29% from its low point set in October of that year, prompting some Wall Street analysts to call the beginning of a new bull market.', ""Not everyone agrees with that classification. Other experts think the S&P 500 has to reclaim its all-time high before the bear officially returns to hibernation. But here's the good news: After Wednesday's close, the index has to climb less than 2% to get there, so a new bull market could be right around the corner (by every definition). Therefore, now might be a great time for investors to buy quality stocks."", ""One to consider now is Oracle (NYSE: ORCL). The massive database software company just reported financial results for its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Nov. 30), and investors immediately sent its stock plunging by 9%. But that isn't the whole story. Here's why Oracle stock might represent one of the best long-term buying opportunities available right now."", ""Oracle is one of America's oldest technology companies. Founded in 1977 -- within a couple of years of both Apple and Microsoft -- its relational database management software was a smash hit in the 1980s. And in the 1990s, the company helped its customers prepare for the age of the internet."", 'That evolved into cloud services in the 2010s, and Oracle Cloud Infrastructure was officially launched in 2016 to deliver powerful computing power to customers through centralized data centers. Today, almost every organization in the world relies on the cloud in some capacity to run their operations online.', ""But we just entered the age of artificial intelligence (AI), and it could be Oracle's largest opportunity ever. AI is currently developed, trained, and deployed in the cloud, and it requires substantial amounts of computing power, which can only be delivered by specialized chips from providers like Nvidia. They can sell for over $40,000 each, so it's far too expensive for most businesses to build their own infrastructure."", ""Therefore, it's left to experienced data center operators like Oracle who can build and manage the infrastructure at scale. In fact, Oracle's latest second-generation data centers -- called Gen2 Cloud -- are constructed with automation at their core. Oracle Chairman Larry Ellison says this infrastructure is very cost efficient; in fact, he said there is no difference in costs between managing 10 data centers and 100 data centers thanks to autonomous technologies."", ""The result is a cheap and efficient experience for the end user. Earlier this year, Ellison said Oracle's Gen2 Cloud has become the No. 1 choice for running generative AI workloads because its proprietary GPU cluster technology has the highest performance, and the lowest cost, in the world."", ""Demand is so great that Oracle now has a supply problem. Ellison said the company is in the process of expanding 66 of its existing data centers while building 100 more, because it has billions of dollars in contracted demand that it currently can't supply. Nvidia's advanced AI data center chips are one of the constraints. Oracle simply can't get its hands on enough of them."", 'Ellison said demand for the company\'s cloud infrastructure and generative AI services is increasing at an ""astronomical rate."" It showed up in the numbers; even while Oracle\'s total revenue grew by a modest 5% year over year (which disappointed investors), Oracle Cloud Infrastructure revenue soared 52% in the second quarter of Oracle\'s fiscal 2024.', ""It only accounted for $1.6 billion of the company's $12.9 billion in total sales, but Ellison said he expects the segment to grow above 50% for years to come, and at that pace it won't be long before it's the driving force behind Oracle overall."", ""Oracle did, however, deliver a whopping 44% gain in net income (profit). As I touched on earlier, Gen2 infrastructure is incredibly cost efficient, so strong increases in the company's bottom line should continue especially once it completes construction of its latest data centers and brings them online. As Oracle Cloud Infrastructure becomes a larger part of Oracle's business, it will likely boost the company's profitability overall."", ""Oracle has attracted some of the leading developers of AI, including Adept AI, Cohere, and even Elon Musk's xAI, which just launched its large language model called Grok. These start-ups have already committed to spending billions of dollars on Gen2 Cloud capacity, and in the case of xAI, Musk already wants significantly more GPUs than Oracle can possibly provide right now. Ellison wasn't kidding when he said demand was astronomical."", 'With that in mind, Oracle stock looks extremely attractive right now. The company has generated $3.62 in trailing-12-month earnings per share, and based on its current stock price of $105, it trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29.', ""By comparison, Microsoft, another cloud-focused AI stock, trades at a much higher P/E ratio of 35.9. Oracle stock would have to gain 24% from here just to catch up, which makes it seem like a bargain at the current price especially considering the company's rapid earnings growth."", ""Longer-term, AI is going to be one of the greatest financial opportunities in the tech sector's history. A report by research and consulting firm McKinsey & Company suggests 70% of companies will use AI by 2030, adding $13 trillion to global economic output. Considering Oracle's Gen2 Cloud is the top choice for generative AI workloads, its stock will likely be a great place for your money, especially at this price."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Oracle wasn't one of them.

The database and software giant missed analyst expectations for revenue, reporting growth of just 5%."", 'Software license revenue tumbled 18%, hardware revenue dropped 11%, and services revenue slipped 2%. The cloud services and license support segment, the largest by far, grew sales by 12%.', 'Overall cloud revenue, which includes infrastructure-as-a-service (Iaas) and software-as-a-service (Saas), expanded by 25%. That compares to 30% growth in the first fiscal quarter. IaaS and SaaS revenue rose 52% and 15%, respectively, down from 66% and 17% growth in the previous quarter.', ""It's clear from Oracle's results that demand for its software has weakened. Given the current economic environment, marked by companies pulling back on spending in some areas, that's not too surprising."", ""It's also clear that demand for Oracle's cloud infrastructure is booming. Oracle is still a small player in the IaaS market, which is dominated by Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, but it's growing much faster than its larger competitors. Oracle's IaaS business produced $1.6 billion in revenue in the second quarter."", 'CEO Safra Katz and Chairman Larry Ellison made it clear during the earnings call that the slowdown in IaaS growth wasn\'t a demand problem. ""So, again, the demand is extraordinary, we can build the data centers relatively fast, and I expect the OCI [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure] growth rate to be over 50% for a few years,"" said Ellison. ""Yes, we\'re not demand-limited in any way right now,"" Katz added.', 'Oracle is having success winning artificial intelligence (AI) workloads, which require powerful GPUs that are in short supply. The bottleneck for Oracle is acquiring those GPUs. ""[A]s more GPUs become available and we can put those in, we have just really unlimited amount of demand,"" said Ellison.', ""Oracle is seeing strong demand for its cloud infrastructure for other types of workloads, as well -- so much so that the company is embarking on a massive expansion of its cloud computing capacity. Oracle is in the process of expanding its 66 existing cloud data centers and is planning to build 100 new cloud data centers. No timeline was given, but the company emphasized that it's capable of building data centers quickly."", ""This cloud data center expansion won't be cheap. Oracle expects to spend about $8 billion in fiscal 2024 on capital expenditures, a bit below fiscal 2023 levels but still nearly double what it spent in fiscal 2022. Oracle's capital spending was just $2.4 billion through the first half of the fiscal year, so the company will more than double its rate of spending in the second half as it brings more cloud computing capacity online."", 'Oracle is not traditionally a capital-intensive company, but its cloud infrastructure business has changed that.', 'The risk for Oracle is that it overbuilds and is stuck with excess capacity and low utilization rates. Demand for AI workloads appears unlimited today, but that may not remain the case once the AI frenzy dies down a bit. And in the general-purpose cloud infrastructure market, a downturn in the economy could slow demand as companies rethink their cloud spending.', ""It's taken years for Oracle's cloud infrastructure business to gain real traction. The company is looking to take advantage of soaring demand, but it's important to remember that IaaS represented just 12% of total revenue in the second quarter. The rest comes from software, support, services, and hardware, and those businesses aren't exactly booming."", ""Oracle has the potential to grow into a major player in the cloud infrastructure market, but it won't be smooth sailing for investors.

Its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) grew 11% to $1.34 and exceeded expectations by a penny."", ""Those headline numbers weren't terrible, but investors had expected better results to justify the stock's year-to-date rally of about 40% prior to its earnings report.

This region will provide access to more than 100 Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services and cloud applications, encompassing offerings such as Oracle Autonomous Database, MySQL HeatWave Database Service, Oracle Container Engine for Kubernetes, Oracle Cloud VMware Solution and AI infrastructure.The Oracle Cloud Valparaíso Region provides organizations with a diverse array of cloud services, enabling them to modernize their applications, innovate through data and analytics and seamlessly transfer various workloads from their on-premises data centers to OCI."", 'Oracle Corporation price-consensus-chart | Oracle Corporation Quote', ""Cloud computing and the Internet of Things play a crucial role in expediting the digital transformation in Chile, serving as essential allies for companies seeking uninterrupted data mobility and enhanced productivity. IDC reports a projected 53% increase in the budget allocated to cloud migration by Chilean companies in 2023. In the realm of software and software services, IDC anticipates an annual growth rate of 9.4%, culminating in a total value of $1.4 billion by 2023.In December 2022, the Chilean government disclosed a 64% surge in the budget designated for the State's digitization in 2023. This translates to an investment of nearly $10 million to enhancing the services and operations of government agencies. The comprehensive digital transformation is anticipated to be completed by 2027.Shares of Oracle, which currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), have gained 23.3% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector’s 47.1% rise due to tough competition from Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google in Chile.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Amazon Web Services (AWS) introduced additional AWS Local Zones in Latin America, contributing to economic diversification in the region. AWS aims to support the development of more resilient economies, fostering sustained economic growth. The low-latency capabilities of Local Zones enable new applications, such as near real-time video analysis for surveillance cameras to enhance traffic management, crime prevention or disaster response.In 2020, Microsoft Corporation announced the establishment of a data center region in Chile as part of its commitment to sustainability goals. This included a pledge to transition to 100 percent renewable energy in Microsoft data centers by 2025. The Chile datacenter region also introduced Azure Availability Zones, thus enhancing the availability of cloud applications and providing added resilience to data center failures.Google established its presence in Chile a decade ago, inaugurating its initial data center four years later, and declared plans for expansion in 2018. By late 2019, the completion of the Curie submarine cable, spanning 10,000 kilometers and linking Valparaíso with Los Angeles, marked a significant achievement. Google then launched its dedicated Cloud Region in Chile, which was a milestone for the country's digital economy.Oracle's distributed cloud presents customers with the benefits of cloud computing while providing increased control over operations and data residency. This approach ensures low latency, even for operations spanning multiple clouds.OCI's distributed cloud lineup supports multi-cloud scenarios, offering options such as Oracle Database@Azure, MySQL HeatWave on AWS and Oracle Interconnect for Microsoft Azure. This enables customers to integrate key capabilities seamlessly across various cloud environments.This is expected to boost cloud services and license revenues in the current fiscal year.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ORCL’s fiscal 2024 cloud services and license revenues is pegged at $44.05 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 24.78%.

After all, you're talking about a bunch of mostly pre-fabricated buildings that customers store things in and rarely go to."", 'Sometimes, however, boring businesses are the best businesses, and early investors in self-storage leader Public Storage (NYSE: PSA) know this very well. Over the past 30 years, Public Storage has generated a 5,870% total return for investors -- more than five times what the S&P 500 produced in the same period.', 'Public Storage is a real estate investment trust, or REIT (pronounced ""reet""), specializing in self-storage properties. It owns just under 3,300 properties in 40 states with a total of 238 million rentable square feet.', 'The company has some major advantages over its peers. As the largest self-storage owner in the U.S., it has scale advantages and the most recognizable brand name in the business. And the economics of the self-storage business are fantastic.', ""In a previous annual report, Public Storage said it could break even with just 35% of its space rented (it's typically over 90% occupied). The company has higher net operating income (NOI) margins than all of its publicly traded competitors and grows through a combination of acquisitions and development."", 'The company has an industry-leading technology platform that provides customer service, property access, and even rental agreements completely through the app, improving efficiency, as well as the customer experience. It also has unmatched financial flexibility to pursue growth opportunities as they arise. Public Storage has extremely low debt, A-rated credit, and $630 million in cash on its balance sheet.', ""One particularly interesting competitive advantage is that Public Storage's management has a long history of avoiding dilution and excessive debt. It's common practice for REITs to fund their growth with a combination of debt and equity (issuing new stock), but Public Storage doesn't."", 'On the equity side, fellow large-cap REITs Prologis\xa0and Digital Realty Trust\xa0have increased their outstanding share counts by 85% and 136%, respectively, over the past decade. Public Storage has 2% more shares than it did 10 years ago.', 'On the debt side, the company spent years avoiding debt altogether, but finally decided to take some on during the extreme low-interest-rate environment in 2019-2021. Even so, $9.1 billion in debt (at an average 2.9% interest rate) is remarkably low for a REIT with a $48 billion market cap.', ""Instead, Public Storage prefers to fund its growth the old-fashioned way -- by paying what it has to in dividends and reinvesting the rest of its earnings into the business. This lack of dilution and interest expense has proven to be a winning combination for investors and is a particularly big advantage in the high-cost-of-capital environment we're currently in."", 'Finally, and perhaps most significant for long-term investors, only 18% of self-storage properties are owned by public REITs. Some are owned by private REITs, but a staggering 73% of self-storage properties are still owned by small operators. This should provide a steady stream of acquisition opportunities over the coming years.', ""One of the most important lessons long-term investors should learn is that an exciting product doesn't always make a great business (look at Peloton\xa0as an example).\xa0 Conversely, a dull or boring product doesn't necessarily make a bad business. Many of the richest people I know got that way by owning and operating laundromats, vending machines, and various rental properties."", 'Public Storage is an excellent publicly traded example of a boring business that has certainly made some of its long-term investors millionaires. It could continue to deliver market-beating performance for decades to come.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Public Storage right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Public Storage, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Public Storage wasn't one of them.

This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.', 'Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.', 'Earnings Whisper', ""Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core."", 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only."", 'A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.', 'Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).', 'How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Micron?', ""For Micron, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.63%."", 'On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.', 'So, this combination indicates that Micron will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.', 'Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?', ""Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number."", 'For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Micron would post a loss of $1.18 per share when it actually produced a loss of $1.07, delivering a surprise of +9.32%.', 'Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.', 'Bottom Line', 'An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.', ""That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported."", 'Micron appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate.

But if it launches the concept nationwide, it could breathe new life into the restaurant stock.

The company relies heavily on franchise-related fees and rents, as it owns the buildings operated by franchise holders. It also collects a 4% fee on all restaurant sales, mitigating the impact of weak sales if business conditions worsen."", ""In the third quarter of 2023, franchise revenue made up about 60% of the company's $6.7 billion in revenue for the quarter.

However, with McDonald's saturating the U.S. and much of the world, the room to add stores is limited for now."", ""But if franchisers want to add CosMc's locations, McDonald's would collect a new round of initial franchising fees and have an incentive to buy additional locations that could bring new sources of rental income. Combine that with the aforementioned 4% fee of gross sales, and growth in the company could accelerate for years to come."", ""Still, for this scenario to become a reality, CosMc's has to succeed to the point that McDonald's would decide to franchise the concept. As a beverage shop, CosMc's would base much of its success on its coffee beverages. This places it in competition with Starbucks, Dutch Bros, Dunkin', and other beverage-oriented stores."", ""Despite competitive concerns, Grand View Research forecasts a compound annual growth rate of 11% for the specialty coffee industry through 2030, indicating that McDonald's could have an opportunity in one key area."", 'Moreover, coffee will not be the store\'s only beverage.

If you want to read about some more Fortune 500 stocks, go directly to 5 Best Fortune 500 Stocks to Buy Now.', 'The post-pandemic economic boom was somewhat overshadowed by supply chain issues, inflation, and geopolitical tensions in the past two years. A fiscal tightening by the Federal Reserve to tackle soaring prices also led to recession fears. The United States economy, however, weathered these storms to emerge stronger than ever. Analysts are now predicting a major boom for stocks. Ed Yardeni, a prominent financial analyst and founder of Yardeni Research, has forecast that the benchmark S&P 500 will jump 30% to 6,000 by 2025.\xa0', 'Tech firms will remain a key driver of this growth, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), all of which feature in the Fortune 500, an annual list compiled and published by Fortune magazine that ranks 500 of the largest United States corporations by total revenue, expected to benefit from the economic boom. The stocks of these three companies are up by 58%, 56%, and 50% this year. After a 12% plunge in 2022, the benchmark S&P 500 is likely to end 2023 with 14% in gains.\xa0', 'This optimism is riding on recent statements from the Federal Reserve that indicate that rate cuts will begin next year. On December 14, Fed chief Jerome Powell said that the Fed was done raising rates as inflation cooled. Stocks rallied and bond yield shrunk after that statement, with analysts jacking up their price forecasts for the coming months. The Fed is expected to make three quarter point cuts to the benchmark interest rates next year. These rates had been at their highest level since 2001 after record inflation in 2022.\xa0', 'Not everybody is convinced about the emerging trends. In late November, prominent investment firm JPMorgan released a gloomy forecast for 2024. In a transition year for the economy, the investment bank predicted that the benchmark S&P 500 would drop to around 4,200 by the end of 2024. The bank identified shrinking global growth and household savings, rising geopolitical risks, and elections in the United States that could add to policy volatility as some of the prime reasons behind this pessimistic forecast.\xa0', 'The position of JPMorgan stands in contrast to others on Wall Street. In addition to Yardeni, famous firms like Bank of America and Deutsche Bank have also backed the S&P 500 to touch record highs next year. Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are also constructive on the index, with David Kostin at the former and Mike Wilson at the latter both predicting that the index will come close to the previous peak in the next few months. The average analyst estimate for the index for 2024 sits at around 4,664, per Bloomberg.\xa0', 'Investors eager to get on top of these growth trends should have a listen to recent remarks by Sundar Pichai, the CEO of tech firm Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), said during the third quarter earnings call that his firm was pleased with the growth in search, short videos, and cloud services. Pichai highlighted the market opportunity offered by the rapid evolution of products and services in the artificial intelligence domain and urged investors to focus on strides being made in countries like India and Japan. He also touched on the importance of cloud services.', '""We see continued growth, with Q3 revenue of $8.4 billion, up 22%.

Rising wages have been one of the main drivers of inflation, and this has proved to be a sticky area, keeping the Fed’s attention and weighing on share prices. For example, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) renegotiated a wage increase for its union-backed workforce this summer, which weighed on margins that were already being constricted by slowing volumes. While the new union deal will dampen profits over the next 12 months due to the front-end-loaded nature of the new five-year contract, management gained increased flexibility to deploy automation, which we think should further enhance UPS’s strong competitive position and provide a long-term tailwind to profitability.”', 'Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 52 \xa0', 'AT&T Inc.

It recently acquired Signify Health and Oak Street Health, entering the In-Home Evaluations and primary care spaces enhancing the company’s ability to offer comprehensive healthcare services as we transition to a system more focused on value-based care.

The healthcare industry has been a growing part of the U.S. economy for decades. As a result, many companies in this sector trade at high valuations reflecting their robust but well-known reputation for growth.

REITs have garnered immense popularity among investors seeking dividends due to their unique structure and inherent income-generating nature. By law, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends, making them attractive for income-seeking investors. According to a report by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, Listed REITs, comprising equity REITs and mortgage REITs, distributed approximately $63.1 billion to their shareholders. These listed REITs are publicly traded on stock exchanges, making their dividends widely accessible to investors. Additionally, public non-listed REITs, which function similarly to listed REITs but are not traded on public exchanges, paid out around $6.1 billion in dividends throughout the same period.', 'While REITs are renowned for their dividends, several other sectors in the market also offer solid dividend payouts to shareholders. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the most prominent dividend stocks that have grabbed investors’ attention.

The smart, relatively safe play is to borrow a stock idea or two from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holdings. The Oracle of Omaha has a great track record when it comes to finding long-term value, after all. You'd do well to follow the lead of Buffett and his acolytes."", ""With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three Buffett picks that would easily be at home in your portfolio as well. Note that none of the picks are named Apple, either. While the maker of the iPhone is Berkshire's single-biggest holding (by far) at this time, it's also become an expensive stock thanks to this year's firm bullishness. If you're looking for a Buffett pick worth stepping into right now, you're better off with other options."", 'In no particular order...', ""Credit card company American Express (NYSE: AXP) certainly isn't as big as Visa or Mastercard, both of which are also found among Berkshire Hathaway's holdings. But there's a reason Buffett's holding a far bigger stake in American Express than he is in rivals Mastercard and Visa. That reason is arguably the strength of AmEx's perks program."", ""See, Visa and Mastercard are merely credit card payment network operators, issuing and managing cards on behalf of banks and other companies with access to lots of would-be borrowers. American Express is different, however. It's a soup-to-nuts outfit, not only handling payment and merchant logistics, but managing its own expansive perks and rewards programs that encourage the use of its cards."", ""For instance, consumers with an American Express Platinum card are reimbursed up to $20 per month on select streaming services, enjoy access to hundreds of private lounges at airports, and get hundreds of dollars worth of yearly credit toward services like hotel stays, airline tickets, and rides provided by Uber. That's why cardholders are willing to pay an annual fee of $695 for their Platinum American Express card."", 'Of course, the company also gets a small piece of the amount of each purchase made by its cardholders.', ""None of this is to suggest Visa or Mastercard aren't worth owning, or that AmEx simply shrugs off any and all trouble (like economic malaise). It poses predictable risks too. Worries about these risks are why American Express shares haven't made any net progress since the middle of 2021."", ""But the company itself is still doing just fine. This year's top line is on pace to grow by 15%, with more than a 9% improvement predicted for next year. Profits are growing accordingly, underscoring the argument that a well-managed card rewards program is marketable in almost any economic environment."", ""You won't find quite as much revenue and earnings growth with Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) as you will with American Express. But what Coca-Cola lacks in growth firepower, it more than makes up for in reliable dividends and dividend growth. The company's not only been able to pay a dividend every quarter for the past several decades, but it's been able to raise its per-share dividend payout every year for the past 61 years. This year's increase raised it from $0.44 per share every quarter to $0.46 per share -- a 4.5% year-over-year increase that's in line with the dividend growth seen over the course of the past couple of decades."", ""You of course know Coca-Cola is the parent to its popular namesake beverage. What you may not realize is that Minute Maid juices, Powerade sports drinks, Gold Peak tea, and Dasani water are just some of the other brands that are part of the company. The diversity of its portfolio is part of the reason for the company's dividend-supporting cash flow; it's got something to sell to everyone at any given time."", ""That's only part of the reason shareholders can expect more of the same into the indefinite future. Just as important (if not more so) is the recent evolution of Coca-Cola's business model."", ""The company spent the better part of the past several years backing away from being in the bottling business, punting that work back to localized bottlers so it can better focus on what it does best. That's marketing and licensing, and then collecting royalties from the bottlers using its flavors and brand names. While this has ultimately meant less revenue, it also means more net profits."", ""Investors getting into a position in Coca-Cola today will be stepping in while the dividend yield is a respectable 3.1%. You can find bigger yields. You'd be hard-pressed, however, to find a yield this strong from shares of a company with this much reliable dividend growth."", 'Last but not least, add Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks you might want to scoop up for yourself.', 'Some investors may recall this Berkshire holding has a bit of a checkered past. Buffett was one of the key orchestrators of 2015\'s merger of then-separate Kraft and Heinz companies, with Berkshire kicking in several billion dollars of its own to see the deal all the way through. By 2019, the combined companies were suffering regular write-downs, however, taking a toll on Berkshire Hathaway\'s bottom line as well.

Kraft Heinz shares are still trading right around where they were in 2019 immediately after several of the challenges linked to the melding of the two food giants were fully exposed."", ""We're now nearly five years removed from the realization of that debacle, however. Not only are those problems now fully in the past, the inflation that was so troubling last year and early this year is also abating."", ""The evidence? Last quarter's modest top-line growth of 1% was paired with a 21.2% improvement in gross profits, extending trends that got going early this year. Overall net income and per-share profit growth are also consistently outpacing sales growth this year, reflecting the strength of all the company's brand names that extend far beyond well-known Kraft and Heinz.

(NYSE:C) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:', '“Citigroup\xa0(“Citi”) is a large-capitalization global diversified financial services holding company that primarily serves multinational institutional and high net worth consumer clients. Citi is one of three large American banks to be designated in “bucket 3 or 4” of the “global systemically important bank” (“G-SIB”) framework by The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. The other banks in this group are J.P. Morgan and Bank of America.', 'As a G-SIB, Citi is subjected to increased regulatory supervision by global bank regulators and central banks. Enhanced regulatory supervision was an important post-crisis reform to strengthen the global financial system by increasing bank capital ratios, transparency, and decreasing risk-taking. These reforms resulted in the largest G-SIBs moving away from risk-oriented banking activities such as advisory, high-yield lending, and trading, towards lower-risk activities. Indeed, Citi’s most valuable, high-growth segment, Treasury and Trade Solutions, is in lower-risk and entrenched activities such as liquidity and cash management, payments, trade solutions, and automated receivables processing. In our view, somewhat unintuitively, Citi’s increased regulatory supervision contributes to the company’s less risky banking business model, and thus its attractiveness as a downside-oriented investment opportunity.', 'Citi’s market perception suffers from the bank’s negative historical reputation. In 2008 during the Great Financial Crisis, Citi received the most TARP funding (the largest “bailout”) of the U.S. banks. TARP funding was provided by the U.S. government to forestall a liquidity problem that threatened to become a solvency problem. More recently, Citi mistakenly used its own capital to pay lenders when acting as Revlon’s loan agent, resulting in a $400M fine by the Federal Reserve and orders to resolve internal controls (which Citi fulfilled). Citi’s large global consumer bank was assembled by prior management in the early 2000s to attract and service high-end global consumers.

He purchased his first stock at age 11, and by 1965, he was operating his own investment company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). He still runs the company today.', 'Berkshire holds an incredible portfolio of public and private companies, and it has successfully navigated every post-Depression crisis to significantly outperform the benchmark S&P 500 over the last 58 years.', ""Berkshire's largest holding today is Apple, which became the world's first $1 trillion company in 2018. Since then, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (parent company of Google), and Nvidia have all amassed trillion-dollar valuations of their own."", ""Thanks to Buffett's leadership, Berkshire is now valued at $772 billion, and its stellar track record suggests it could soon become the first non-technology company in the U.S. to join the $1 trillion club. Here's why it could become a $1 trillion company as soon as 2024."", 'Image source: The Motley Fool.', 'Buffett is a value investor. He looks for profitable companies with consistent growth and strong management teams, and he especially likes those returning money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.', ""He waits patiently to grab those opportunities at a reasonable price. You won't find him chasing the latest stock market trends; in fact, he's often deploying billions of dollars when most other investors are selling."", ""However, Buffett's most powerful weapon is time. He buys stocks with the intention of holding for decades, which allows the effects of compounding to build his wealth for him. The companies he owns grow larger over time, and so do the dividends."", ""For example, Berkshire invested $1.3 billion in Coca-Cola between 1988 and 1994, acquiring 400 million shares, which it still owns today. Coca-Cola paid Berkshire a dividend of $75 million in 1994 -- in 2022, that dividend payment had swelled to $704 million! Not to mention the incredible capital growth; Berkshire's 400 million Coca-Cola shares are now worth $23.6 billion."", ""Berkshire Hathaway was founded as a textiles company in 1929, and Buffett acquired a controlling stake in 1965 when it was going through a rough patch. He quickly realized Berkshire's core business was no longer viable, so he turned it into a holding company for his various investments."", 'Today, it owns 51 different publicly traded stocks and securities worth a combined $365 billion, and Coca-Cola is just one of many success stories. The following are equally noteworthy:', 'American Express: Berkshire owns a 20% stake in the credit card giant, valued at $25.5 billion. But it all started with a $1.3 billion investment in the lead up to 1995, and today, the firm collects $304 million in dividends (and growing) every year.', ""Apple: Berkshire has invested around $35 billion in Apple stock since 2016 -- its largest ever bet. It has paid off handsomely because the stake is currently valued at more than $179 billion, accounting for almost half of the investment company's public portfolio."", 'Plus, Berkshire wholly owns several successful private businesses like Dairy Queen, Duracell, and GEICO.', ""Buffett has presided over substantial returns for investors. Between the time he acquired a controlling stake in Berkshire in 1965 and the end of 2022, the company's stock had delivered a mind-blowing gain of 3,787,464%."", ""That translates to a compound annual return of 19.8%, which is twice the return of the benchmark S&P 500 index. That would've been enough to turn a perfectly timed investment of just $100 into more than $3.7 million. The incredible gain comes on the back of a stellar operating performance by Buffett and his team."", 'Berkshire generated just $49 million in revenue in 1965, and by 2022, that had grown to a whopping $302 billion. Over $157 billion came from sales and services across its various businesses, with an additional $74 billion coming from insurance premiums and $52 billion coming from its railroad, utilities, and energy interests. The company is on track to increase that figure by 19% in 2023, to $360 billion.', ""Berkshire has delivered positive growth and strong stock returns during 11 different presidencies without straying from Buffett's fundamental strategy. With a presidential election coming up in 2024, that's a great reminder for everyday investors to stay the course, no matter which candidate wins."", ""As I mentioned earlier, Berkshire Hathaway is valued at $772 billion. Therefore, its stock needs to gain about 30% to propel the company into the $1 trillion club. Based on its average annual return of 19.8% since 1965, it doesn't appear likely to get there in 2024."", ""However, there's a good possibility Berkshire could outperform next year. History suggests 2024 will almost certainly bring more positive returns for the S&P 500, and Apple stock (Berkshire's largest holding) is entering the year near its best-ever level. Plus, some of Berkshire's top income producing stocks like Apple, Coca-Cola, American Express, and Bank of America are currently paying record dividends."", ""The broader macroeconomic environment will likely be more favorable in 2024, too. According to CME Group's FedWatch tool, the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates five times throughout the year. That will be great for Berkshire's consumer-focused businesses, and also its transport and logistics segments as lower rates should drive more economic growth."", 'Finally, as my Motley Fool colleague Sean Williams points out, Berkshire is buying back its own stock hand over fist. It has completed a whopping $72 billion worth of share repurchases during the past five years, so Buffett himself is clearly very bullish on its prospects.', ""Nevertheless, even if Berkshire doesn't make it into the $1 trillion club in 2024, it's only a matter of time."", 'More From The Motley Fool', '10 Best Stocks to Buy Today', '20 of the Top Stocks to Buy (Including the Two Every Investor Should Own)', 'What Is an ETF?', '5 Recession-Proof Stocks', 'How to Beat the Market', 'Where should you invest $1,000 right now?', ""Bank of America is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Occidental Petroleum had US$19.1b of debt in September 2023, down from US$20.1b, one year before. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$611.0m, its net debt is less, at about US$18.4b.', 'The latest balance sheet data shows that Occidental Petroleum had liabilities of US$8.94b due within a year, and liabilities of US$33.6b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$611.0m and US$3.67b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities total US$38.2b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.', 'This is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$48.7b. This suggests shareholders would be heavily diluted if the company needed to shore up its balance sheet in a hurry.', ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio)."", ""Occidental Petroleum has net debt of just 1.3 times EBITDA, indicating that it is certainly not a reckless borrower. And this view is supported by the solid interest coverage, with EBIT coming in at 8.4 times the interest expense over the last year. The modesty of its debt load may become crucial for Occidental Petroleum if management cannot prevent a repeat of the 48% cut to EBIT over the last year. When it comes to paying off debt, falling earnings are no more useful than sugary sodas are for your health. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Occidental Petroleum's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, Occidental Petroleum actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces."", ""Occidental Petroleum's EBIT growth rate and level of total liabilities definitely weigh on it, in our esteem. But the good news is it seems to be able to convert EBIT to free cash flow with ease. Looking at all the angles mentioned above, it does seem to us that Occidental Petroleum is a somewhat risky investment as a result of its debt. Not all risk is bad, as it can boost share price returns if it pays off, but this debt risk is worth keeping in mind. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum that you should be aware of before investing here."", ""If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet."", 'Have feedback on this article?

It actually hit a record intraday high, it looks like. And this is on this news, positive results from, it sounds like, this mid-stage study of this drug, non-opioid, that helps, it sounds like, with nerve pain from diabetes."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Yes, so specifically, this right now was studied in treatment for nerve pain related to diabetes, but the hope is that it will have more expansive applications. And, as you alluded to, really, the pharmaceutical industry has been searching very urgently for alternatives to opioids because of the persistence and horribleness of the fentanyl epidemic.', 'And so this seen by investors as one potentially promising move. Jefferies analyst, Michael Yee, a friend of the program, said the data looks at least as good or better as-- or better than investor expectations. Vertex mostly makes cystic fibrosis treatments. So this is sort of-- would be a big deal more broadly in terms of the development of opioids. And it also would be a big deal for Vertex if it indeed is able to move forward with it.', ""JOSH LIPTON: What it sounds like, compete with a non-opioid treatment from Pfizer as well. Another name we're talking, too."", ""JULIE HYMAN: Yes, another name we've been talking about today."", ""JOSH LIPTON: That's what Pfizer needs, more competition, right?"", ""JULIE HYMAN: Let's talk about Canopy Growth here. The stock is plummeting today, down by 20%, and that's of news of share consolidation. The company issuing a 1 for 10 reverse stock split. And this is a penny stock now, as you can see. It's down below $1 here."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Up in smoke.', 'JULIE HYMAN: It was-- oh gosh.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Too much? Too easy?', ""JULIE HYMAN: It's alright. It's too easy."", ""JOSH LIPTON: -- It's too easy. I get it."", 'JULIE HYMAN: This stock was above $50 as recently as 2021, but the cannabis industry has had a tough time, and Canopy has been subject to that as well. So that reverse stock split here really reflecting the weak sentiment that has been out there already with regard to Canopy.', ""JOSH LIPTON: This stock is a total mess this year. It's down about-- it's down nearly 80% year to date. And when you look at financial analysts who cover the name, you don't see a lot of confidence that things are going to get better. I see exactly one buy on this name right now, even after that drop."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And usually, when you do these kinds of reverse stock splits, it's because you're in danger of getting delisted. So it seems like that by doing this, it will not be delisted from NASDAQ."", ""JOSH LIPTON: All right, last one here, US Steel shares moving higher today. That's after reportedly receiving multiple bids. Over $40 a share. You can see a nice pop-up, about 6%. So reports that US Steel, Julie, they've now received multiple bids in excess of $40 a share. This is coming from CNBC, saying the board is actually meeting today, that's according to their sources."", 'And remember rival Cleveland-Cliffs made this public a few months ago that $35 per share cash and stock offer, and US Steel has been considering offers, we know, for months now. And you can date this one back to over the summer. Of course, just an iconic American company created more than 100 years ago. And still a very much important player, a big player in the steel industry.', ""JULIE HYMAN: Yeah, and we've definitely seen this push for consolidation, right? Because of some of the export controls, et cetera, that have been affecting the steel market, reportedly, ArcelorMittal, the Indian steel giant, also has been in the bidding here for this company. So we'll see what ends up happening. It is sort of unusually protracted, isn't it? You mentioned that it's been going on since the summer. But the bidding has really crept up here. That initial bid, I don't know if you mentioned, from Cleveland-Cliffs was $17.50, and now we're talking about $40. So that's a big change."", ""JOSH LIPTON: There is a deal, too, some questions. I mean, if the deal gets done, what does it look like? Is it all? Is it parts? Also, this kind of headline-making consolidation, does that attract regulators? You're talking about a deal that could really sort of redefine the industry. So it would be interesting, if it did happen, what kind of government response you would see there, too."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Right, exactly. Good point.']"

The crowd-pleasing concoction was popularized in the 1940’s by Smirnoff-owner John G. Martin and Jack Morgan, the owner of the Los Angeles British pub Cock ‘n’ Bull. At the time, Martin was having a hard time selling vodka to Americans, who preferred whiskey and beer. Meanwhile, Morgan also had a surplus of ginger beer at his bar and his girlfriend happened to have a company that made copper mugs. When it all came together, quite a decent product emerged, one that revolutionized the American cocktail culture forever.\xa0\xa0', 'Though there is a wide variety of drinks out there made with ginger beer and lime these days, the Moscow Mule sticks out simply because it really doesn’t taste like alcohol, yet it still has culinary substance. It’s refreshing and light, but it has personality.', 'Vodka is one of the Most Consumed Alcohols in the World. As we stated in our article – 20 Highest Quality Vodkas In The World – the global vodka market was valued at $25.98 billion in 2022, and is estimated to reach $40.25 billion by 2030, with a CAGR of 5.6% during the forecast period.\xa0', 'Vodka-based RTD beverages are witnessing a huge increase in new product development, which is expected to drive the market.

Diageo was among the pioneers in the low-alcohol vodka space, launching its 30% ABV Ketel One Botanicals range in May 2018, said to be the first of its kind at the time. It contains no artificial flavors, added sugar, or artificial sweeteners. Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) also capitalized on the trend in 2020, with the release of its sugar-free SVEDKA Pure Infusions range, also 30% ABV.\xa0', 'The recent reincarnation of flavored vodkas has also seen the industry gain some much-needed traction. Gone are the days of the overly sweet artificial flavors and cheap plastic bottles, we are currently going through a flavored vodka renaissance where brands are reimagining the category with high-quality bottles and natural botanicals and extracts that expand the drink’s flavored expressions from subtle to overt.

According to IWSR, the spirits-based RTDs are expected to grow at a CAGR of 33% in volume in the U.S. by 2025.\xa0', 'Keeping up with the trend, the French alcohol giant Pernod Ricard announced earlier this year that it is partnering with The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) to launch the Absolut Vodka & Sprite pre-mixed cocktail in select European countries in early 2024, including the UK, the Netherlands, Spain, and Germany.

The smart, relatively safe play is to borrow a stock idea or two from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway holdings. The Oracle of Omaha has a great track record when it comes to finding long-term value, after all. You'd do well to follow the lead of Buffett and his acolytes."", ""With that as the backdrop, here's a closer look at three Buffett picks that would easily be at home in your portfolio as well. Note that none of the picks are named Apple, either. While the maker of the iPhone is Berkshire's single-biggest holding (by far) at this time, it's also become an expensive stock thanks to this year's firm bullishness. If you're looking for a Buffett pick worth stepping into right now, you're better off with other options."", 'In no particular order...', ""Credit card company American Express (NYSE: AXP) certainly isn't as big as Visa or Mastercard, both of which are also found among Berkshire Hathaway's holdings. But there's a reason Buffett's holding a far bigger stake in American Express than he is in rivals Mastercard and Visa. That reason is arguably the strength of AmEx's perks program."", ""See, Visa and Mastercard are merely credit card payment network operators, issuing and managing cards on behalf of banks and other companies with access to lots of would-be borrowers. American Express is different, however. It's a soup-to-nuts outfit, not only handling payment and merchant logistics, but managing its own expansive perks and rewards programs that encourage the use of its cards."", ""For instance, consumers with an American Express Platinum card are reimbursed up to $20 per month on select streaming services, enjoy access to hundreds of private lounges at airports, and get hundreds of dollars worth of yearly credit toward services like hotel stays, airline tickets, and rides provided by Uber. That's why cardholders are willing to pay an annual fee of $695 for their Platinum American Express card."", 'Of course, the company also gets a small piece of the amount of each purchase made by its cardholders.', ""None of this is to suggest Visa or Mastercard aren't worth owning, or that AmEx simply shrugs off any and all trouble (like economic malaise). It poses predictable risks too. Worries about these risks are why American Express shares haven't made any net progress since the middle of 2021."", ""But the company itself is still doing just fine. This year's top line is on pace to grow by 15%, with more than a 9% improvement predicted for next year. Profits are growing accordingly, underscoring the argument that a well-managed card rewards program is marketable in almost any economic environment."", ""You won't find quite as much revenue and earnings growth with Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) as you will with American Express. But what Coca-Cola lacks in growth firepower, it more than makes up for in reliable dividends and dividend growth. The company's not only been able to pay a dividend every quarter for the past several decades, but it's been able to raise its per-share dividend payout every year for the past 61 years. This year's increase raised it from $0.44 per share every quarter to $0.46 per share -- a 4.5% year-over-year increase that's in line with the dividend growth seen over the course of the past couple of decades."", ""You of course know Coca-Cola is the parent to its popular namesake beverage. What you may not realize is that Minute Maid juices, Powerade sports drinks, Gold Peak tea, and Dasani water are just some of the other brands that are part of the company. The diversity of its portfolio is part of the reason for the company's dividend-supporting cash flow; it's got something to sell to everyone at any given time."", ""That's only part of the reason shareholders can expect more of the same into the indefinite future. Just as important (if not more so) is the recent evolution of Coca-Cola's business model."", ""The company spent the better part of the past several years backing away from being in the bottling business, punting that work back to localized bottlers so it can better focus on what it does best. That's marketing and licensing, and then collecting royalties from the bottlers using its flavors and brand names. While this has ultimately meant less revenue, it also means more net profits."", ""Investors getting into a position in Coca-Cola today will be stepping in while the dividend yield is a respectable 3.1%. You can find bigger yields. You'd be hard-pressed, however, to find a yield this strong from shares of a company with this much reliable dividend growth."", 'Last but not least, add Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ: KHC) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks you might want to scoop up for yourself.', 'Some investors may recall this Berkshire holding has a bit of a checkered past. Buffett was one of the key orchestrators of 2015\'s merger of then-separate Kraft and Heinz companies, with Berkshire kicking in several billion dollars of its own to see the deal all the way through. By 2019, the combined companies were suffering regular write-downs, however, taking a toll on Berkshire Hathaway\'s bottom line as well. As Buffett bluntly conceded at the time, ""I was wrong in a couple of ways on Kraft Heinz ... We overpaid for Kraft.""', ""The market doesn't seem to disagree. Kraft Heinz shares are still trading right around where they were in 2019 immediately after several of the challenges linked to the melding of the two food giants were fully exposed."", ""We're now nearly five years removed from the realization of that debacle, however. Not only are those problems now fully in the past, the inflation that was so troubling last year and early this year is also abating."", ""The evidence? Last quarter's modest top-line growth of 1% was paired with a 21.2% improvement in gross profits, extending trends that got going early this year. Overall net income and per-share profit growth are also consistently outpacing sales growth this year, reflecting the strength of all the company's brand names that extend far beyond well-known Kraft and Heinz. Maxwell House, Jell-O, Ore-Ida, and Oscar Mayer are just a sampling of the other names in The Kraft Heinz Company's portfolio."", ""More and more investors are seemingly starting to see this company's finally working its way out of its funk; shares have soared since its third-quarter results were released early last month."", ""At a trailing price-to-earnings ratio of only 15.1 and a dividend yield of 4.4%, there's plenty more room for Kraft Heinz shares to continue marching higher."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Kraft Heinz right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Kraft Heinz, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Kraft Heinz wasn't one of them.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us."", ""For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Coca-Cola is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.18 = US$13b ÷ (US$98b - US$24b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, Coca-Cola has an ROCE of 18%.

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Coca-Cola."", ""The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has consistently earned 18% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 32% in that time. 18% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Coca-Cola has consistently earned this amount. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns."", 'On a side note, Coca-Cola has done well to reduce current liabilities to 25% of total assets over the last five years. This can eliminate some of the risks inherent in the operations because the business has less outstanding obligations to their suppliers and or short-term creditors than they did previously.', 'In the end, Coca-Cola has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue.

The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it.

Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date.

The market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 5.5% over the forecasted period and reach $3.02 trillion by 2032. The market growth can be attributed to the increased GDP contribution, resulting in higher assets, property, and commercial activities. The rise in GDP leads to an increased demand for property and casualty insurance products including property, liability, and business interruption coverage. Growing urbanization is another key factor fueling the growth of the market. The demand for property and casualty insurance coverage is expected to increase due to a surge in people migrating to cities. The expansion of urban infrastructure can lead to risks such as higher traffic congestion, property thefts, and natural disasters, thereby increasing the demand for property and casualty insurance.', 'One of the major trends in the market is data analytics to enhance underwriting, claims processing, and risk assessment.

According to a recent CNBC article, U.S. crude oil fell below $70 a barrel, closing at the lowest level since June. Also, Axios pointed out that record domestic oil production helped spark the sector-wide deflation.', 'So, it then leads to an obvious question: why bother with oil stocks to buy? On relative financial/investment terms, hydrocarbon players are undervalued. Yes, we can talk all day about renewable energy solutions. However, fossil fuels leverage the incredible scientific power of energy density. That will never go away unless the laws of physics somehow shift.', 'Fundamentally, though, the geopolitical environment continues to worsen. To be fair, major oil producing nations standing ready to deepen production cuts in the first quarter of 2024 haven’t resulted in much of an upward shock in prices. However, I also believe you’ve got to look at the long game.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Obviously, the situation in the Middle East is tense, sparking ideological conflicts throughout the world. Also, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows no sign of abating. With headwinds stubbornly marching higher, speculators may want to consider the below oil stocks to buy.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'At the moment, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) might not appear a viable candidate for oil stocks to buy. Since the beginning of the year, CVX fell 18%. Since Oct. 19, the situation hasn’t look auspicious for the integrated oil giant. However, I’m going to step away from the noise and take a look at what the alpha dogs of Wall Street think. After all, they move the market – not some random voice on the internet.', 'Interestingly, Fintel’s options flow screener – which targets exclusively big block transactions likely made by institutions – reveals recent acquisitions of sold puts. In particular, a major entity or entities sold 6,800 contracts of the Jan 19 ’24 170.00 Put. For those unfamiliar with the lexicon, the trade (at face value) assumes that by the expiration date of Jan. 19, 2024, CVX will not materially drop below the $170 strike price.', 'Yes, CVX closed at $142.53 on Wednesday. However, the option trader collected a premium of $11.925 million for underwriting the risk. Therefore, as long as CVX doesn’t dip meaningfully below the $143.515 transaction price, the trader will win. That’s a bold bet that may augur well for Chevron.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com', 'A multinational corporation focused on hydrocarbon exploration and production (upstream), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) admittedly seems risky as a candidate for oil stocks to buy. True, the year-to-date loss of a bit over 2% seems relatively reasonable. However, in the past five sessions, COP dropped almost 5% of equity value. Still, it might be worth keeping on your radar due to a possible short-covering mechanism materializing.', 'From late November to Wednesday, institutional investors have been selling COP call options. The underlying strike prices range between $116 at the low to $120 at the high. It’s hard not to notice that these are fairly aggressive wagers. Keep in mind that COP closed the midweek session at $110.52. Yes, momentum is negative, which is likely what inspired the bearish trades. Still, it’s risky.', 'Basically, the difference between the current price and the high-side strike is about 8.6%. So, a sudden surge in sentiment could see options traders cover their short calls, which may be bullish for COP. Also, it’s not always a great idea to short a security which features a strong buy rating.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'A midstream operator, Williams (NYSE:WMB) on paper makes a solid investment under any circumstance. No, it’s never purely insulated from economic forces obviously. However, as it’s heavily involved in energy storage and transportation services, it’s the lifeblood of the economy. That’s probably not going to change anytime soon given the aforementioned energy density of fossil fuels. For that reason, it’s one of the oil stocks to buy.', 'Further, Wall Street appears to agree, sending WMB up more than 11% since the January opener. However, it’s also possible that further gains can materialize. Looking at the security’s options flow, we find that bears have apparently targeted WMB for future declines. Specifically, a major entity (or entities) sold 27,014 contracts of the Jan 19 ’24 32.00 Call on Wednesday. At the time of the transaction, shares traded for $35.87.', 'That seems awfully aggressive given the premium paid of $1.14 million. Yes, WMB slipped recently, which likely inspired the bearish wager. Still, a few good sessions may be enough to spark a short covering.', 'Source: JHVEPhoto/Shutterstock.com', 'Another top-flight midstream operator, Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) benefits from the same fundamentals as Williams. Basically, Kinder represents a vital component of the economy thanks to its vast network of pipelines and terminals. However, it’s relatively undervalued compared to WMB, with shares down almost 3% since the January opener. Is that enough to make it one of the oil stocks to consider?', 'To be upfront, Kinder Morgan represents a tricky proposition. It’s true that bears are betting against KMI. However, recent transactions show that institutional traders are buying puts instead of selling calls. At face value – assuming that these trades aren’t part of a complex, multi-tiered strategy – the bought puts don’t have an obligatory consequence; that is, one “merely” loses the principle in buying the puts.', 'However, what’s interesting is that the implied volatility (IV) curve of KMI shows heightened interest in far out-the-money (OTM) calls. That’s unlike many other oil stocks, which feature heightened IV toward the deep in-the-money (ITM) calls. So, options traders could be anticipating upside, which may upset the bears.', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Although Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) represents a laggard among downstream operators, it enjoys one major catalyst: the attention of Paul Singer of Elliott Management. As I reported earlier, the activist investor bought up a significant stake in PSX stock. In turn, it’s urging for significant changes to help unlock value. So far, the pressure seems to be working. Since the start of the year, PSX gained nearly 24%.', 'Conspicuously, in the trailing month, PSX returned about 10% of equity value, delighting patient long-term stakeholders. Even better, it’s quite possible that shares can continue their impressive rally. Yes, the spotlight from Elliott Management undoubtedly inspires the wheels to turn faster. However, sold calls that were placed months ago now risk getting blown up. If the bears don’t cover, they could face financial consequences.', 'Interestingly, other institutional bears seem unperturbed with the rise of Phillips 66. On Dec. 1, major entities sold 3,416 contracts of the Feb 16 ’24 135.00 Call. That seems a risky bet because the delta between the strike and Wednesday’s close is only 8%.', 'Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com', 'Another downstream petroleum company, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) focuses primarily on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels and other petrochemical products. Since the start of the year, VLO moved up modestly, a bit over 2%. However, in the trailing five sessions, VLO slipped almost 2%. With circumstances not working in Valero’s favor (given the record domestic production), the bears put VLO in their crosshairs.', 'If we learned anything from the post-Covid-19 market ecosystem, you can never be too comfortable holding a bearish position.

They are often considered riskier investments compared to larger companies because they tend to have lower liquidity, which means there might be fewer buyers and sellers for these stocks. As a result, microcap stocks can be more volatile and susceptible to significant price fluctuations. However, when selected thoughtfully, micro-cap businesses showcase substantial potential for growth that surpasses what's typically available with larger-cap counterparts. According to a report by Boston Partners, a Boston-based investment management company, research into the past indicates that value-oriented micro-cap funds have shown a trend of performing better than private equity over time. The report referred to data by Preqin, which showed that from the beginning of 1995 to June 2020, the US Private Equity Index grew by 716 percent. This growth, although impressive and higher than the S&P 500 Index's 255% increase during the same period, was overshadowed by the CRSP Equal Weighted Microcap Index, which saw growth of 740 percent. This comparison highlights the potential for better returns with actively managed micro-cap funds compared to private equity investments."", ""In one of its reports, Perritt Capital Management delved into the small firm effect, which refers to the tendency for stocks of smaller companies to outperform those of larger companies when considering the same level of risk. This effect was initially studied in 1978 by Rolf Banz during his doctoral dissertation at the University of Chicago. Banz organized NYSE-listed stocks by their market capitalization, creating five portfolios ranging from the largest to the smallest stocks on the Exchange. These portfolios were held for five-year periods, after which the stocks were re-sorted, and new portfolios were formed. He repeated this process from 1925 to 1975, analyzing the monthly returns of each portfolio. Over the 50-year analysis, the first four portfolios, which included all but the smallest NYSE firms, delivered returns in line with their risk levels, suggesting these portfolios were fairly priced or slightly overvalued by the market. These portfolios, collectively, yielded an average risk-adjusted monthly return of -0.06 percent (alpha) or -0.72 percent annually, indicating they underperformed relative to their systematic risk. Conversely, the portfolio holding the smallest NYSE companies stood out, providing investors with a significantly higher risk-adjusted excess return of 0.44 percent per month (alpha), nearly 6 percent annually. This anomaly suggests that smaller NYSE firms, despite their risk, delivered higher-than-expected returns, contrasting with the efficiency of pricing seen in the larger firms' portfolios."", 'The report highlighted a study conducted by Professors Avner Arbel and Paul Strebel called ""The Neglected and Small Firm Effects."" Their research aimed to test whether stocks of companies receiving less attention from analysts offered higher risk-adjusted returns compared to more researched companies. Analyzing S&P 500 Index companies, they found that as research concentration decreased, risk-adjusted returns increased. Additionally, when combining research concentration with firm size, the favorable risk-adjusted returns were amplified. While the study already showed that smaller firms outperformed larger ones, it revealed that under-researched small company stocks performed even better. Essentially, the lack of analyst attention distorted the risk and return characteristics of stocks from smaller firms.', ""Microcap stocks often fly under the radar for many investors due to their smaller size and perceived higher risk. However, historical analyses have shed light on the potential of these equities, catching the attention of investors. What's interesting is that some of these smaller companies, despite their size, also offer dividends to their shareholders. This is somewhat unusual as smaller companies are often assumed to reinvest most profits back into the business for growth rather than distributing them to shareholders. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) are some of the best dividend stocks from the large-cap sector.

PEP has been in a good spot, courtesy of strength and resilience in its categories, diversified portfolio, modernized supply chain, improved digital capabilities, flexible go-to-market distribution systems and robust consumer demand trends, which have been aiding its performance. Robust performances of the global beverage and convenient food businesses have been the key to the company’s growth story. Productivity and cost-saving plans also bode well.PepsiCo continued its robust top and bottom-line surprise trend for the seventh consecutive quarter in third-quarter 2023. Sales and earnings also improved year over year. On an organic basis, revenues grew 8.8% year over year, driven by broad-based growth across categories and geographies.PEP’s core constant-currency earnings improved 16% from the year-ago period, backed by strong top-line growth, as well as the mitigation of inflationary pressures through cost-management and revenue-management initiatives. The strong top line resulted from a robust price/mix in the reported quarter. Unit volume declined 1.5% year over year for the convenient food business and was flat year over year for the beverage business.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PEP’s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 6.4% and 11.2%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers.However, PepsiCo has been witnessing cost pressures from the impacts of supply-chain disruptions; and inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. Adverse currency rates also act as headwinds.Shares of the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have lost 8% in the past six months against the industry’s 1.4% growth.

Accelerated growth in the global beverage and convenient food businesses positions the company for improvement in the near term. This reflects the strength in its diversified portfolio.The company has been a key beneficiary of its presence in the snacking and food category, along with its beverage profile. On a year-over-year basis, organic revenues grew 8% for the global beverage business and 9% for the convenient food business in the third quarter. Region-wise, organic revenues improved 7% and 12%, respectively, in North America and International businesses.In the third quarter, Frito-Lay North America (FLNA) and Quaker Foods North America (QFNA) delivered organic revenue growth of 7% and 5%, respectively. Growth in FLNA was driven by its diversified portfolio, marketplace execution and robust pricing. The business continued to gain from strong category trends, as consumers prefer popular, trusted brands that offer value, convenience and variety. In QFNA, growth was driven by effective pricing actions and higher organic volumes.PepsiCo has been continually focused on driving greater efficiency and effectiveness by driving down costs and plowing back these savings to develop scale and core capabilities. In 2019, the company delivered more than $1 billion in productivity savings, keeping it on track with its goal of generating productivity savings of at least $1 billion annually through 2023.PEP expects to achieve this productivity goal through savings generated from restructuring actions. These actions are likely to position the company to further simplify, synchronize and automate processes; re-engineer the go-to-market and information systems; simplify the organization; and optimize its manufacturing and supply-chain footprint.As part of these restructuring actions, the company estimates incurring pre-tax charges of $2.5 billion through 2023 (with a cash portion of $1.6 billion). Savings from the productivity and restructuring plans should go a long way in driving the top line and margins.PepsiCo’s cost-management initiatives have been aiding margins in third-quarter 2023. On a consolidated basis, the reported gross margin expanded 140 basis points (bps), while the core gross margin expanded 104 bps in the third quarter. The reported operating margin expanded 186 bps from the year-ago quarter. Meanwhile, the core operating margin expanded 82 bps due to ongoing holistic cost-management initiatives to drive superior supply chain and distribution efficiencies, offset by a double-digit increase in advertising and marketing expenses.PepsiCo raised its core EPS guidance for 2023. The company reaffirms its organic revenue growth prediction of 10% for 2023. It anticipates core constant-currency EPS growth of 13% from the year-ago period’s reported figure. PepsiCo expects a core EPS of $7.54 for 2023, suggesting an 11% increase from the core EPS of $6.79 reported in 2022.PEP also outlined its initial view for 2024. It expects to deliver organic revenue and core constant currency EPS growth at the upper end of its long-term guidance ranges for 2024.

They are often considered riskier investments compared to larger companies because they tend to have lower liquidity, which means there might be fewer buyers and sellers for these stocks. As a result, microcap stocks can be more volatile and susceptible to significant price fluctuations. However, when selected thoughtfully, micro-cap businesses showcase substantial potential for growth that surpasses what's typically available with larger-cap counterparts. According to a report by Boston Partners, a Boston-based investment management company, research into the past indicates that value-oriented micro-cap funds have shown a trend of performing better than private equity over time. The report referred to data by Preqin, which showed that from the beginning of 1995 to June 2020, the US Private Equity Index grew by 716 percent. This growth, although impressive and higher than the S&P 500 Index's 255% increase during the same period, was overshadowed by the CRSP Equal Weighted Microcap Index, which saw growth of 740 percent. This comparison highlights the potential for better returns with actively managed micro-cap funds compared to private equity investments."", ""In one of its reports, Perritt Capital Management delved into the small firm effect, which refers to the tendency for stocks of smaller companies to outperform those of larger companies when considering the same level of risk. This effect was initially studied in 1978 by Rolf Banz during his doctoral dissertation at the University of Chicago. Banz organized NYSE-listed stocks by their market capitalization, creating five portfolios ranging from the largest to the smallest stocks on the Exchange. These portfolios were held for five-year periods, after which the stocks were re-sorted, and new portfolios were formed. He repeated this process from 1925 to 1975, analyzing the monthly returns of each portfolio. Over the 50-year analysis, the first four portfolios, which included all but the smallest NYSE firms, delivered returns in line with their risk levels, suggesting these portfolios were fairly priced or slightly overvalued by the market. These portfolios, collectively, yielded an average risk-adjusted monthly return of -0.06 percent (alpha) or -0.72 percent annually, indicating they underperformed relative to their systematic risk. Conversely, the portfolio holding the smallest NYSE companies stood out, providing investors with a significantly higher risk-adjusted excess return of 0.44 percent per month (alpha), nearly 6 percent annually. This anomaly suggests that smaller NYSE firms, despite their risk, delivered higher-than-expected returns, contrasting with the efficiency of pricing seen in the larger firms' portfolios."", 'The report highlighted a study conducted by Professors Avner Arbel and Paul Strebel called ""The Neglected and Small Firm Effects."" Their research aimed to test whether stocks of companies receiving less attention from analysts offered higher risk-adjusted returns compared to more researched companies. Analyzing S&P 500 Index companies, they found that as research concentration decreased, risk-adjusted returns increased. Additionally, when combining research concentration with firm size, the favorable risk-adjusted returns were amplified. While the study already showed that smaller firms outperformed larger ones, it revealed that under-researched small company stocks performed even better. Essentially, the lack of analyst attention distorted the risk and return characteristics of stocks from smaller firms.', ""Microcap stocks often fly under the radar for many investors due to their smaller size and perceived higher risk. However, historical analyses have shed light on the potential of these equities, catching the attention of investors. What's interesting is that some of these smaller companies, despite their size, also offer dividends to their shareholders. This is somewhat unusual as smaller companies are often assumed to reinvest most profits back into the business for growth rather than distributing them to shareholders.

Celebrating its 10th anniversary in 2024, this powerful initiative continues to fill in the gaps to access and opportunity to sport by increasing participation and retention of Black, African-American, Hispanic and Native American girls throughout the country. This year, a total of $280,000 has been awarded to 40 organizations – 27 of these organizations serving girls with disabilities – across 23 states, and Washington, D.C., helping to fuel and diversify sports opportunities for more than 5,300 girls across 25 traditional, non-traditional, and adaptive sports."", ""Since its inception, the Sports 4 Life initiative has funded 219 organizations across 37 states, Washington, D.C. and the U.S. Virgin Islands, providing $2.3 million in grants to 80,000 girls participating in over 40 sports.

Further, according to WSF's '50 Years of Title IX: We're Not Done Yet' research report, boys with disabilities consistently participate in sports at higher rates than girls with disabilities.

And with recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technology, they are expanding their reach and accessibility with Coach, an AI-powered career prep platform that tailors advice to an individual student's goals, learning from each interaction."", ""CareerVillage.org's Founder and Executive Director Jared Chung and Special Projects Senior Manager Rebecca Gitomer share the non-profit's technology evolution and how its partnership with Cisco has led to crucial, high-impact, replicable and scalable partnerships in the education industry."", ""Cisco invests in nonprofits to increase their impact through replication and scale, how has this influenced CareerVillage.org's strategy?"", 'For us, scale is extremely important and always top of mind. Career development is a challenge that affects young people all over the world, and there is a real lack of investment and overall support, especially in underserved communities. Cisco has been aligned with our scalability mission from the beginning of our partnership in 2017, and what began as volunteer opportunities for Cisco employees to participate in has evolved into crucial funding from Cisco to help us unlock high-impact partnerships that have allowed us to scale across classrooms in the U.S.', 'An example of this is in 2020 when we piloted our first district partnership with the San Francisco Unified School District (SFUSD) that was supported by the Cisco Foundation. This relationship remains today with educators and students across SFUSD schools still using CareerVillage.org in their classrooms. The empowerment Cisco provided us to begin our K12 district partnerships allowed for important learning lessons to replicate similar partnerships across the country. Our work testing with educators and students in classrooms and the learnings from these experiences have led to dramatic growth in educators using CareerVillage.org and helping them meet the needs of their districts. Since 2020 our educator reach has doubled.', 'What are some key areas Cisco is helping with to transform your technology?', ""There have been several improvements and enhancements to our technology, partnerships, and core team that have enabled this change, which would not have been possible without Cisco's continued support for our mission. We see Cisco as a uniquely aligned partner in this work for a few reasons:"", 'We prioritize scalable technology-based solutions that impact underserved populations.', 'We share ambitious global social impact goals.', 'We have visions to transform K12 education.', ""We also believe that the movement we've created is laying the foundation for a transformative nationwide college access and career readiness program and the Cisco Foundation has been fundamental to this work."", ""Most recently Cisco funding has gone towards supporting our latest innovative technology the AI Career Coach. We're incredibly grateful for supporters like Cisco who are early believers in our work with cutting edge technology, and thousands of Cisco employees have advised students through our platforms impacting millions of learners around the world."", 'What is Coach, who is it geared to, and how is it a differentiator for people that use it?', ""This is a natural next step for CareerVillage.org, which has reached over 7 million people over the past decade. For years we've been mobilizing huge online communities to give career advice, and now, we have this opportunity to use AI to scale up even further."", ""Our AI-powered career prep platform ‘Coach' can help people practice mock interviews, improve their resumes, explore new career options, and much more. In short, Coach helps with everything you need to get career-ready and land a great job. Coach is knowledgeable, encouraging, and reliable, just like every career coach should be."", ""Currently in beta testing and ever-evolving, Coach is intended for everyone - middle schoolers all the way through career changers, and we're ensuring that we're getting a diversity of perspectives in user profiles to test Coach now to make it higher quality, eliminate bias, and more. Recent feedback from some of our beta testers includes:"", '""I will be using this platform in the future as I near college applications and need to submit essays and resumes. Not only was I challenging the AI, the AI was challenging me."" (Student Beta Tester)', '""Out of the activities that I completed, my favorites were the career exploration activity and the mock interview. The responses were beyond incredible!"" (Student Beta Tester)', '""I would absolutely love to use it with my students. I would recommend it to my colleagues and friends as well!"" (Educator Beta Tester)', '""Everything is extremely tailored"" (Educator Beta Tester)', '""It helped me identify my passions, matched me with suitable careers, provides step by step plans to achieve my goals."" (Student Beta Tester)', '""This activity definitely helped strengthen my skills and communication abilities!"" (Student Beta Tester)', 'Free at the individual level, Coach will be a game changer when it comes to career supports, which as it currently stands is something that is systemically underinvested in. And our largest differentiator is the coalition of partners we have established backing Coach, helping to test, co-design, and integrate resources into the Coach database while ensuring responsible AI is at the forefront of development.', 'What are the biggest benefits of incorporating AI for career development?', ""For most people, career guidance is a huge life-changer and, until now, we've never been able to put a world-class personal career coach in front of every underserved person. Our model is all about making resources more accessible, more personal, and more responsive. The personalization is a huge opportunity with AI and because career development is such an individual experience, this personalization is key, and AI allows us to do it at scale. In our current beta version, even from the first day of testing the feedback we were hearing was that the personalization was really shining through. Through AI we are also able to reduce silos by more easily aggregating sector resources, become more scalable and offer 24/7 accessibility, and be more cost effective."", 'How can people learn more about Coach and get involved with CareerVillage.org?', 'Interested institutions who would like to get involved and partner with CareerVillage.org', 'Interested individuals who want to sign up to the Coach waitlist', 'Learn more about CareerVillage.org and its various opportunities', 'View original content here.', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"

Shares reached a 52-week high of $58.19 on Sept. 1. But the stock plunged in mid-November after Cisco released earnings for its fiscal first quarter, which ended Oct. 28. Investors clearly found something in the earnings report concerning."", ""For bargain hunters who are wondering if this drop has created a good buying opportunity, the question is: Are the things that triggered the sell-off long-term issues, or short-term ones that can be expected to eventually dissipate? Let's dive in and see."", 'Cisco actually delivered amazing results in the latest quarter. It was the strongest Q1 in company history in terms of revenue and profit. Sales rose 8% year over year to $14.7 billion, and net income grew 36% to $3.6 billion as the company met pent-up demand that had been left previously unfilled due to supply chain constraints.', ""The balance sheet was strong as well. At the end of the quarter, Cisco's assets totaled $98.8 billion compared to $53.6 billion in liabilities, and it had $23.5 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments."", 'So why did the stock sink after Cisco posted such spectacular results? Because management warned it was seeing signs that the surge in demand was starting to subside -- namely, product orders declined 20% in the quarter.', ""As a result, the company offered revenue guidance of at least $12.6 billion for its fiscal Q2, which would be down significantly from the prior-year period's $13.6 billion. Management also forecast that the period of waning customer demand could last a couple of more quarters before it rose back toward normal levels. That weak near-term outlook led to the sell-off of Cisco stock."", ""But investors who are focused on the long term should keep in mind that this short-term headwind is expected to subside eventually, after which the stock will be poised to recover. And one key reason to be confident in Cisco's ability to bounce back is its software business."", ""Though Cisco built its reputation as a computer networking company, it has also developed a substantial set of software offerings, including IT systems monitoring and cybersecurity. This allows it to generate predictable recurring revenue through software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscriptions. Its SaaS segment isn't as sensitive to cyclical ups and downs as its hardware business."", ""Cisco's SaaS offerings will strengthen after the company closes its acquisition of cybersecurity analytics firm Splunk in 2024. Splunk's solutions provide complementary capabilities that will enhance Cisco's cybersecurity product suite."", ""Also, Splunk's revenue, net income, and free cash flow all grew year-over-year in its fiscal third quarter, which ended Oct. 31. Splunk's business is prospering with $1.1 billion in fiscal Q3 sales -- revenue that will add to Cisco's top line next year."", ""Splunk's free-cash-flow growth should be a particularly attractive feature for income investors since it will add to Cisco's ability to maintain its dividend, which yields over 3% at the current share price. And Cisco has raised its payouts for 13 consecutive years, a solid track record. So long-term investors can collect Cisco's dependable dividend while waiting for its stock to bounce back."", ""In the wake of Cisco's recent share price drop, now is a good time to buy the stock to hold for the long term. Cisco's business will be even more well-positioned once its acquisition of Splunk closes and its sales bounce back from the looming cyclical downturn."", ""In the meantime, investors can benefit from Cisco's dividend, which makes it a good income stock. These factors point to Cisco as a worthwhile investment for the long haul."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Cisco Systems right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Cisco Systems, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Cisco Systems wasn't one of them.
