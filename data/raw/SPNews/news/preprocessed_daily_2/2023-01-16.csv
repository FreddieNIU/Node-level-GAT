While Schwab is known as a brokerage company, the majority of the company’s earnings power is derived from the net interest income they earn on client cash balances held in brokerage accounts.

You should consider the Schwab U.S. MidCap ETF (SCHM), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 01/13/2011.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $9.83 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Mid Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Mid Cap BlendWith market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion, mid cap companies usually contain higher growth prospects than large cap companies, and are considered less risky than their small cap counterparts. Thus they have a nice balance of growth potential and stability.Blend ETFs are aptly named, since they tend to hold a mix of growth and value stocks, as well as show characteristics of both kinds of equities.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.04%, making it the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.56%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Industrials sector--about 18.50% of the portfolio. Financials and Consumer Discretionary round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Biomarin Pharmaceutical Inc (BMRN) accounts for about 0.55% of total assets, followed by Aes Corp (AES) and Westinghouse Air Brake Technologie (WAB).The top 10 holdings account for about 5.05% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHM seeks to match the performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index before fees and expenses. The Dow Jones U.S. Mid-Cap Total Stock Market Index is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index. The Index includes the mid-cap portion of the Dow Jones U.S. Total Stock Market Index actually available to investors in the marketplace and includes the components ranked 501-1000 by full market capitalization.Story continuesThe ETF return is roughly 6.65% so far this year and is down about -9.49% in the last one year (as of 01/16/2023). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $60.50 and $77.87.The ETF has a beta of 1.11 and standard deviation of 28.71% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 503 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab U.S. MidCap ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHM is a reasonable option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Mid Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The Vanguard MidCap ETF (VO) and the iShares Core S&amp;P MidCap ETF (IJH) track a similar index.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.Despite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. Check out our latest analysis for Texas Instruments How Quickly Is Texas Instruments Increasing Earnings Per Share?Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. Shareholders will be happy to know that Texas Instruments' EPS has grown 21% each year, compound, over three years. If growth like this continues on into the future, then shareholders will have plenty to smile about.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. The music to the ears of Texas Instruments shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 47% to 53% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. That's great to see, on both counts.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of Texas Instruments' forecast profits?Story continuesAre Texas Instruments Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$162b company like Texas Instruments. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$176m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.1% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Should You Add Texas Instruments To Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Texas Instruments has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in Texas Instruments' continuing strength. On the balance of its merits, solid EPS growth and company insiders who are aligned with the shareholders would indicate a business that is worthy of further research. It is worth noting though that we have found 3 warning signs for Texas Instruments (2 are concerning!) that you need to take into consideration.Although Texas Instruments certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

4,4f54cc44-dbfe-3139-9a2d-d8a12d665740,NUE,2023-01-16,The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for January 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-stocks-buy-january-123127031.html,1673613087,STORY,"['XPO', 'HCA', 'TSCO', 'EL', 'NUE', 'SPGI']","[The task of looking for the best stocks to buy for January 2023 is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. There are so many possibilities; it’s hard to pick just seven.The S&amp;P 500 is coming off one of its worst years in history. In 2022, the index’s total return was -18.11%. Only on six occasions since 1926 did the index do worse than this past year.In December, the index lost 5.90%, excluding dividends, putting an exclamation point on a rotten year. Compared to some of the other monthly losses, its nearly 6% decline was middle-of-the-road alarming.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInterestingly, heading into December, the S&amp;P 500 had delivered two consecutive months of healthy gains. It was up 7.99% in October and 5.38% in November. However, a third successive monthly gain was just too much to ask from the stock market gods.  The seven best stocks to buy in January are companies whose businesses are performing reasonably well and whose stocks are on a roll. These companies posted a total return of at least 10% over the past three months through Jan. 10, are are likely to keep the momentum going into February and beyond. BBWIBath &amp; Body Works$46.14NUENucor$155.71HCAHCA Healthcare$255.15ELEstee Lauder$262.25SPGIS&amp;P Global$367.77XPOXPO Logistics$37.76TSCOTractor Supply$220.74Bath &amp; Body Works (BBWI)A Bath &amp; Bodyworks storefrontSource: ShutterstockBath &amp; Body Works (NYSE:BBWI) has a three-month total return of 35.1%. Its three-year total return is 46.7%. On Nov. 16, the company raised its guidance for the 2022 fiscal year. Previously, its earnings estimate was $2.85 per share at the midpoint of its guidance. It now expects EPS of $3.10 at the midpoint. “We are continuing to stay close to our customer, and we remain disciplined in our expense and inventory management,” its Q3 2022 press release stated. “Long-term, we are confident in the fundamentals and potential of our business, and we are excited for Bath &amp; Body Works’ next growth chapter as we officially welcome global personal care and beauty industry veteran, Gina Boswell, as the company’s next Chief Executive Officer in December.”Story continuesBBWI stock jumped on the positive third-quarter results and guidance. Earlier in November, the company announced its new Chief Executive Officer. Gina Boswell is an executive with more than 30 years of experience, including eight at Unilever (NYSE:UL). Between consumers cutting back on spending and shifting toward more experiential products and services, Bath &amp; Body Works braces for lower demand. However, it’s important to remember that it’s facing 2021 comparables that were record-breaking due to Covid-19. As a result, a return to more normal buying patterns was expected. Trading at 1.4-times sales, BBWI stock is still reasonably-priced, despite its gains in the past three months. I wouldn’t be surprised if the momentum continued well into 2023.Nucor (NUE)Steel stocks: rods, bars and other forms of steelSource: ShutterstockNucor (NYSE:NUE) has a three-month total return of 28.5%. Its three-year total return is 43.7%. I’ve admired the North Carolina steel producer for some time. In March 2022, I recommended it, along with nine other S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. I also recommended NUE stock in September 2021. I thought it was among the best stocks that were down, but not out. In mid-September, the company’s shares tumbled after it announced that its Q3 2022 earnings would be significantly below Wall Street estimates and lower than those from the second quarter. Within a couple of weeks, its shares had fallen to $100. When Nucor reported its Q3 2022 results on Oct. 20, they were better than the company’s September guidance, to $6.50 a share, 10 cents above the high end of its range. “Nucor has already achieved a record-breaking year for earnings per share through the first nine months of 2022 and we continue to believe that we will set a new record for full-year earnings in 2022,” stated its Oct. 20 press release.In recent weeks, analysts have been warming to the innovative steel producer. On Jan. 4, Bank of America reinstated coverage of NUE stock with a buy rating and a $172 price target.  There is no question that the company’s results will moderate from the past year’s record results. Nucor’s return on invested capital is more than double its five-year average of 18.57%.  In my opinion, despite the company likely reverting to the mean over the next 6-12 months, Nucor remains an excellent long-term buy.  HCA Healthcare (HCA)two doctors look over a piece of paper while standing in a hallwaySource: ShutterstockHCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) has a three month total return of 26.1%. Its three-year total return is 19.8%.The 25 analysts that cover the hospital operator give it an average overweight rating with a target price of $255.45. Its return on invested capital is 16.31%, while its earnings yield is 7.09%,. That’s reasonable, if not historically low, for one of the best stocks in this space right now. On Jan. 3, HCA finalized its deal to sell three New Orleans-area hospitals to LCMC Health for $150 million, after obtaining approval from the Louisiana Department of Justice to do the transaction. Nurses represented by National Nurses United opposed the sale, as it would leave New Orleans with a duopoly between LCMC and Ochsner Health System. For the country’s largest hospital owner, the sale of the three hospitals is part of its recycling of assets. In 2021, the company sold 50 home health locations and five hospitals for $1.62 billion. It has one hospital left in Louisiana. That will likely be sold soon enough.HCA finished the third quarter with 182 hospitals, down from 183 a year ago. It also had 125 freestanding outpatient surgery centers, up from 123 in Q2 2022. Nevertheless, it’s a revenue-generating machine with $44.74 billion year-to-date through Q3 2022, 2.4% higher than a year ago.Despite higher costs, the company still made $2.90 billion in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) profits in the quarter, an EBITDA margin of nearly 20%. HCA has a 27.2% market share in some of America’s biggest growth markets. This makes it an excellent long-term play.Estee Lauder (EL)An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comEstee Lauder (NYSE:EL) has a three month total return of 21.3%. Its three-year total return is 8.3%. Estee Lauder remains one of the best long-term holds in the consumer discretionary sector. I’ve liked it for years. I first recommended the stock to InvestorPlace readers in November 2012. Every time the stock approached $50 on the downside, investors should be buying.From my November 2012 article to the stock’s all-time high of $374.20 hit in January 2022, EL stock gained 545%. So despite losing nearly 23% over the past year, it’s still gained a bunch for shareholders over the past decade.In September, Goldman Sachs analyst Jason English upgraded Estee Lauder to a Buy from Neutral with a $303 price target. “[Estee Lauder] is arguably emerging from Covid as a stronger business than when it entered the pandemic,” Barron’s reported the analyst’s comments.I couldn’t agree more. On Jan. 10, several media outlets reported that fashion designer Tom Ford bought a $51 million mansion in Palm Beach. But, of course, it’s easy to do that when you sell your brand to Estee Lauder for $2.8 billion. Estee Lauder beat out Kering (OTCMKTS:PPRUY), the owner of several luxury brands, including Gucci, Balenciaga, and Yves Saint Laurent, to buy the Ford brand in November. Estee Lauder struck preemptively to ensure it retained the Tom Ford Beauty brand license. It is the company’s largest acquisition in its history, and remains one of the best stocks to buy in the consumer discretionary space.S&amp;P Global (SPGI)Screenshot through a magnifying glass of the official website of the company S&amp;P Global (SPGI)Source: AntonSAN / Shutterstock.comS&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI) has a three month total return of 18.9%. Its three-year total return is 8.0%. The financial services company consistently makes my lists of the best stocks to buy. Most recently, I included it as one of three stocks with high growth and margins. However, you wouldn’t think that, looking at its operating margins for the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 30. They were in the mid-40% range, due to significantly lower revenues from its S&amp;P Global Ratings segment in 2022.Long-term investors shouldn’t be worried by the company’s near-term slowdown. Instead, it’s a function of the current state of the markets. Once another bull market takes hold, the unit’s revenues will head significantly higher. The 22 analysts that cover S&amp;P Global give it an average buy rating with a target price of $395.65. Its return on invested capital is 13.34%, considerably below its five-year average of 42.74%, while its earnings yield is 3.34%, in line with its five-year average. On Dec. 1, the company presented its medium-term financial targets at its 2022 Investor Day. It expects to grow organic revenues by 7-9% annually over the next four years with adjusted operating margins of 48-50%. “We have full confidence in our ability to achieve these ambitious medium-term targets, which reflect the resilience of our financial model, the ability to accelerate growth and innovation by continued investments, and our focus to deliver unparalleled value for our customers,” said S&amp;P Global Chief Financial Officer Ewout Steenbergen. Analysts see EPS in 2022 of $11.12 and $12.59 in 2023. Accordingly, this stock is trading action 28.1-times its 2023 earnings. XPO Logistics (XPO)Self-driving truck stocks: a self-driving truck on the roadSource: Mike Mareen / ShutterstockXPO Logistics (NYSE:XPO) has a three month total return of 14.3%. Its three-year total return is 12.6%. XPO CEO Brad Jacobs is a legend in the trucking industry. He’s also got a good sense of humor. Jacobs appeared in a Yahoo Finance interview in October, where he talked about his company’s spinoff of RXO (NYSE:RXO), its automated freight brokerage business, and his next big challenge. Bloomberg had this to say about the billionaire:“The billionaire chief executive officer of XPO Logistics Inc. is hunting for a new industry in which to invest after spending just more than a decade building  a company that jumped in market value to about $10 billion from about $160 million. He’s now splitting XPO into three parts and, for the most part, exiting the business,” Bloomberg contributor Thomas Black wrote on Oct. 17. At the same time Jacobs looks for his next adventure, he’ll remain Chairman of XPO, GXO Logistics (NYSE:GXO), which it spun off in 2021, and RXO, which will get spun off in the next month.Most everything Jacobs touches turns to gold. Indeed, XPO has a lot to do with him getting this reputation, and is the key reason this is one of the best stocks in this space. I expect it to continue to perform over the long haul.The 23 analysts that cover XPO give it an average buy rating with a target price of $43.95. Its return on invested capital is 18.2%, while its earnings yield is 20.56%, easily its highest in the past decade. Tractor Supply (TSCO)A Tractor Supply Co. StoreSource: ShutterstockTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) has a three month total return of 13.8%. Its three-year total return is 35.9%.The specialty retailer reported Q3 2022 results in October. Despite missing analyst estimates of $3.29 billion in revenue for the quarter by $20 million, this company remains one of the best stocks in retail. Additionally, on the bottom line, its earnings per share were $2.10, three cents higher than the consensus. “Tractor Supply delivered another record quarter as we continued to gain market share and extended our trend of consistent and stable net sales and earnings growth,” stated CEO Hal Lawton in its Q3 2022 press release.The 33 analysts that cover Tractor Supply give it an average overweight rating with a target price of $232.34. Its return on invested capital for the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 24, 2022, was 17.80%, while its earnings yield is 4.23%, in line with its five-year average. Around the same time Tractor Supply reported its Q3 2022 results, it completed its $320 million acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home. Tractor Supply is taking 81 of the family-owned specialty retailer’s locations. The other 85 have been sold to two buyers for $72 million. In addition, it is selling Orsheln’s corporate headquarters and distribution center to one of the buyers of the discarded stores for $10 million. Tractor Supply will ultimately pay $238 million or $2.94 million per store.TSCO continues to be one of the best growth stories in retail.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

One way you can implement such a strategy is by increasing your exposure to dividend-paying large-cap stocks.If you’re seeking safe harbors, plus the opportunity for long-term capital growth, these types of stocks fit the bill. The companies in this category are by-and-large venerable, established enterprises. They are well-positioned to continue paying out their current dividends, perhaps even increasing their payouts.These payouts provide a steady baseline of returns, in up and down markets. Beyond their appeal as income plays, these stocks also offer strong appreciation potential, when the stock begins to make a recovery.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, what are the best dividend-paying large-cap stocks to buy right now? Consider taking a closer look at these seven. Each of these stocks has a forward dividend yield of at least 3%, offering gradual growth potential over a long time frame.BMYBristol-Myers Squibb$71.60DOWDow Inc.$58.52FFord$13.43PMPhilip Morris International$101.44UPSUnited Parcel Service$182.95USBU.S. Bancorp$47.59VZVerizon Communications$41.81Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)Bristol-Myers (BMY) logo at the top of a cellphone.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for yield, value, and growth, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) is a great choice. Currently, this large-cap pharma stock sports a forward dividend yield of 3.2%. With six years of consecutive dividend growth, BMY has increased its payout by an average of 6.88% annually over the past five years.Indeed, BMY stock is arguably undervalued. Shares trade for just 9.4-times forecasted earnings for 2022. That’s slightly lower than other large-cap pharma stocks, which trade for between 10- and 15-times forward earnings. This valuation may also be too low, given the company’s projected future earnings growth.Story continuesAccording to UBS analyst Keith Parker, Bristol-Myers Squibb is expected to report compounded annual earnings per share (or EPS) growth of 13% over the next three years. Even if BMY maintains its current multiple, shares could still steadily climb higher, in tandem with higher earnings.Dow Inc. (DOW)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for one of the dividend-paying large-cap stocks with higher yields, consider Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW). Shares in this chemicals company have a forward dividend yield of 5%. Yes, this company has not raised its dividend since it was spun off from DuPont (NYSE:DD) in 2019.However, with a payout ratio of only 35.4%, its 70 cent per share quarterly payout is likely sustainable. Along with an above-average dividend yield, DOW stock also trades for just 8.8-times estimated 2022 earnings. Although earnings are expected to drop in 2023, even when you take this into account, DOW remains more-than reasonably-priced, at 13.1-times forward earnings.Furthermore, if energy prices (which have pressure on Dow’s margins) ease during 2023, the company’s earnings could come in ahead of expectations. With all this in mind, high-yield, low-priced DOW stock is a great choice for value-minded investors.Ford (F)Ford logo badge on grill of carSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comAs a recession looms, you may be questioning the merits of buying Ford (NYSE:F) stock today. However, while the post-pandemic boom times for automakers are now in the rearview mirror, and excitement over this “old school” car company’s move into electric vehicles (or EVs) has waned, Ford is still worthy of a buy.Why? First, even if earnings drop this year, they’ll likely be sufficient to maintain Ford’s current dividend, which was reinstated in 2021. Sell-side forecasts call for EPS of $1.71. The company’s current payout is 15 cents per quarter, or 60 cents per year (giving F stock a 4.5% forward yield).Also, despite fading “EV mania,” the vehicle electrification trend isn’t going away. Reporting strong EV sales during 2022, as it continues to successfully increase its presence in this fast-growing area of the auto market, excitement for F stock could rev back up again.Philip Morris International (PM)An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.comPhilip Morris International (NYSE:PM) is the world’s largest publicly-traded cigarette maker by market cap. However, Philip Morris, whose legacy business is the non-U.S. operations of its former corporate parent, Altria Group (NYSE:MO), is embracing a smoke-free future.That is, the Marlboro maker has made major progress bringing out non-combustible tobacco products, namely its IQOS heated tobacco product. PM is also increasing its exposure to the smokeless tobacco and nicotine products segment of the industry, with its purchase of Swedish Match (OTCMKTS:SWMAY).The company’s aggressive moves to adapt to changing tobacco use trends could help it sustain (and continue to grow) its high dividend. PM stock currently has a forward yield of 5%, and a 14-year track record of dividend growth. Since the spinoff from Altria in 2008, Philip Morris has raised its quarterly dividend by more than 235%, from 54 cents to $1.27.United Parcel Service (UPS)Close up of UPS logo printed on a delivery truck; partial view of the driver sitting at the wheel, waiting at a red traffic light in south San Francisco baySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) shares have floundered over the past year. This makes sense, given the challenging and uncertain economic climate. However, with shares in the package transportation company trading for only 14.7-times estimated 2023 earnings, the impact of an economic slowdown may already be baked into its valuation.As InvestorPlace‘s Alex Sirois recently argued, UPS remains a dominant company in the logistics industry, with a strong future. Once there’s an economic and stock market comeback, UPS stock will more-than-likely make a comeback as well. In the meantime, you can be paid to wait for a rebound, via UPS’s 3.3% dividend.While not the highest yield among the dividend-paying large-cap stocks, UPS has a solid dividend growth track record. The company has raised its payout 13 years in a row. Over the past five years, UPS’s dividend has gone up by an average of 12.86% annually.U.S. Bancorp (USB)A pink piggy bank wearing a grad cap sits on a wooden table in front of a chalkboard.Source: ShutterstockU.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is one of America’s largest financial institutions. Like other bank stocks, worries about the economy have put pressure on shares over the past year.However, USB stock has been trending higher more recently, and it could keep climbing. If recession worries ease, and higher interest rates result in earnings growth in 2023 (as expected per sell-side forecasts), investors could continue to dive back into the stock. Increased profitability resulting from higher interest rates is also a big positive when it comes to future dividend growth.USB already has a fairly high dividend. At current prices, the stock’s forward yield comes in at 4%. However, if earnings keep climbing, so too could USB’s quarterly payout. U.S. Bancorp raised its dividend by 13.5% in 2019, and by 9.5% in 2021. A similarly-sized increase may be in the cards this year.Verizon Communications (VZ)5G stocks, VZ stockSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comIt’s not inaccurate to say that telecom stocks like Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) have been “dividend traps” over the past year. A 6.2% payout (VZ’s forward yield) doesn’t look too appealing, when you weigh it against the stock’s 22.1% price decline over the past year.But while VZ stock has generated negative total returns over the past twelve months, things could play out a whole lot differently moving forward. In fact, shares in this major telecom company have already begun to bounce back, making a double-digit move higher in the past month, thanks to promising statements about subscriber growth made by CEO Hans Vestberg.Trading at a heavily-discounted 8.1-times estimated 2022 earnings, if Verizon can deliver better-than-expected results, shares could continue to climb back near prior price levels. Even a partial recovery, coupled with its high-yield payout, could produce fantastic total returns in 2023, for investors buying today.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel held MO.

We see further upside from 2Q23, as the market tightens,” said analysts at ING, in a note.Some evidence of this ample supply came from data pointing to Iranian oil exports hitting new highs in the last two months of 2022 despite U.S. sanctions on higher shipments to China and Venezuela.Energy consultant SVB International said Iran's crude exports in December averaged 1.137 million barrels per day, up 42,000 barrels per day from November and the highest 2022 figure SVB has reported based on estimates given earlier.However, supply could be impacted by the news that Turkey shut its vital Bosphorus Strait to shipping early Monday after a vessel wedged itself on the banks of the waterway that connects the Black Sea to global markets.Such incidents in the Bosphorus are usually resolved within hours, but a prolonged issue could prevent oil tankers sailing from Russia from passing the strait.Story continuesAnother factor helping crude prices rise has been signs inflation has peaked, particularly in the U.S., potentially leading to the Federal Reserve reining in its aggressive tightening policies, to the detriment of the U.S. dollar.A weaker greenback makes commodities, including oil, which are denominated in dollars, cheaper for foreign buyers to buy.The key data release this week will be U.S. retail sales, on Wednesday. They posted their largest decline in 11 months in November and a similar drop in December would add to expectations that the Fed will cool its hefty rate hikes to avoid more damage to the economy and thus crude demand from the largest consumer in the world.Related ArticlesCrude oil lower; monthly demand reports in focusOil prices slip as markets await demand forecasts, economic clarityGold hovers around 8-mth high ahead of data-heavy week]"

(NYSE:OMC)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-omnicom-121635295.html,1673871395,STORY,['OMC'],"[Omnicom Group Inc. (NYSE:OMC) led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Omnicom Group’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Omnicom Group Is Omnicom Group Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Omnicom Group is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $124.38, but it is currently trading at US$84.06 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Another thing to keep in mind is that Omnicom Group’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What kind of growth will Omnicom Group generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of Omnicom Group, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting earnings growth of 5.6%, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since OMC is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on OMC for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy OMC. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

""We can't ignore this possibility, but at this stage we do not consider it a main scenario.""THE YEN UN-ANCHOREDThe BOJ's uber-easy policy has acted as a sort of anchor for yields globally, while dragging down the yen. Were it to abandon the policy, it would put upward pressure on yields across developed markets and most likely see the yen surge.The dollar has been undermined by falling U.S. bond yields as investors wager the Federal Reserve can be less aggressive in raising rates, given inflation has clearly turned the corner.The Japanese yen rose to a more than seven-month peak against the dollar on Monday, as market sentiment was dominated by expectations that the BOJ would abandon or make further tweaks to its yield control policy.The yen jumped roughly 0.5% to a high of 127.215 per dollar, before easing to 128.3 by 1156 GMT.The dollar index, which measures the U.S. unit against a basket of major currencies, recovered from a 7-month low earlier in the session to 102.3.Futures now imply almost no chance the Fed will raise rates by half a point in February, with a quarter-point move seen as a 94% probability.Yields on 10-year Treasuries are down at 3.498%, having fallen 6 basis points last week, close to its December trough, and major chart target of 3.402%.Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FX Strategy at Deutsche Securities, said the loosening of global supply bottlenecks in recent months was proving to be a disinflationary shock, which increases the chance of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. ""The lower inflation itself encourages a soft landing through real wage gains, by allowing the Fed to more readily pause and encouraging a better behaved bond market, with favourable spillovers to financial conditions,"" Ruskin said.U.S. stock markets were closed on Monday for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a national holiday.Commodities prices which had rallied last week, dipped on Monday.The drop in yields and the dollar had benefited the gold price, which jumped 2.9% last week, but the precious metal slipped 0.2% to $1,916 an ounce on Monday.Oil prices slid but held near the year's highs as a rise in COVID cases clouded the prospects for a surge in demand as China reopens its economy.Brent crude fell 25 cents, or 0.29%, to $85.03 a barrel by 1210 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 was down 14 cents, or 0.18%, at $79.72 a barrel.($1 = 127.8000 yen)(Reporting Lawrence White and Wayne Cole; Editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise and Bernadette Baum)]"

Were it to abandon the policy, it would put upward pressure on yields across developed markets and most likely see the yen surge.The dollar has been undermined by falling U.S. bond yields as investors wager the Federal Reserve can be less aggressive in raising rates given inflation has clearly turned the corner.The Japanese yen rose to a more than seven-month peak against the dollar on Monday, as market sentiment was dominated by expectations that the BOJ would make further tweaks to, or fully abandon, its yield control policy.The yen jumped roughly 0.5% to a high of 127.215 per dollar, before easing to 128.6 by 0915 GMT.The dollar index, which measures the U.S. unit against a basket of major currencies, recovered from a 7-month low touched earlier in the session to be at 102.6.Futures now imply almost no chance the Fed will raise rates by half a point in February, with a quarter-point move seen as a 94% probability.Yields on 10-year Treasuries are down at 3.498%, having fallen 6 basis points last week, close to its December trough, and major chart target of 3.402%.Alan Ruskin, global head of G10 FX Strategy at Deutsche Securities, said the loosening of global supply bottlenecks in recent months was proving to be a disinflationary shock, which increases the chance of a soft landing for the U.S. economy. ""The lower inflation itself encourages a soft landing through real wage gains, by allowing the Fed to more readily pause and encouraging a better behaved bond market, with favourable spillovers to financial conditions,"" Ruskin said.""A soft landing also reduces the tail risk of much higher U.S. rates, and this reduced risk premia helps global risk appetite,"" Ruskin added.Commodities prices which had rallied last week, dipped on Monday.The drop in yields and the dollar had benefited the gold price, which jumped 2.9% last week, but the precious metal slipped 0.4% to $1,911 an ounce in early trading on Monday .Oil prices slid as a rise in COVID cases clouded the prospects for a surge in demand as China reopens its economy.Brent crude fell 73 cents, or 0.83%, to $84.57 a barrel by 0857 GMT, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude CLc1 was down 61 cents, or 0.6%, at $79.24 a barrel.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest California Companies and Stocks.California is not just the most populous state in the U.S. with over 39 million residents, but it is also the largest economy in the U.S., with its 2021 GDP worth over $3.4 trillion. Texas is the next biggest with a GDP of just over $2 billion, which shows how wide the gap between the first and the second biggest state is. Just for some perspective on how truly large the economy of California is, it is the biggest subnational economy in the world. If California was a country, it would be the 4th largest economy in the world, surpassed only by China, Germany and Japan!25 biggest California companies and stocksstellamc/Shutterstock.comCalifornia is home to Silicon Valley which is considered to be the technological hub of the world, with many of the biggest tech companies in the world headquartered there, including some of the biggest California companies and stocks. More than 30 businesses in the Fortune 1000 are headquartered in Silicon Valley not to mention thousands of startup companies which are headquartered in the region to take advantage of the wealth of talent not to mention venture capital. After all, around a third of the total venture capital fund in the U.S. is spent in Silicon Valley.Of course, the tech industry isn't the only industry in the state worth over $3.4 trillion. Finance, manufacturing and business sectors are all important contributors to the economy of California while its agricultural output is the highest of any state in the country. Some of the biggest media companies are also located in the state, which shouldn't be surprising. After all, Los Angeles, home to Hollywood, is also located in California. Overall, unemployment in the state is at 4.1%, an increase of 0.1% from October despite almost 27,000 nonfarm payroll jobs being added. However, the state is in a much better situation compared to November 2021 when the unemployment rate was 5.8%.Story continuesOf course, it isn't all doom and gloom for companies in California as the state does provide several financial incentives for businesses including consulting and low-cost training pertaining to loans and grants, startup business plans, strengthening operations and entering new markets among others. While taxes are comparatively high in the state, companies are also provided tax incentive programs which are presented to encourage innovation, development and growth.California is a Democratic state, and unlike most Republican states, it imposes high taxes on corporations to derive revenue that is used to fund the state's budget. Because of this difference in tax rates, many companies have started to move their headquarters from California, with perhaps the most recent high profile move being Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which moved its headquarters to Texas from California, something that Elon Musk had been threatening for a while. According to a report from the Hoover Institution, the rate of companies leaving California in 2021 was twice that of 2020 and 2019, and three times that of 2018, which includes 11 Fortune 1,000 companies. With costs being exceptionally high in the state, many other companies might follow suit in a bit to reduce costs.MethodologyTo determine the biggest California companies and stocks, we first found out the 25 top companies by revenue headquartered in California from Fortune 500 and then determined their latest market cap from Yahoo Finance. In what has been a volatile year especially for tech stocks, which are well-represented among the largest companies in California, which is why the top 25 stocks in the state had an average loss of 20% over the previous year.

If you want to skip the detailed analysis about the oil industry, go directly to 5 best oil stocks to buy according to hedge funds.As per US Energy Information Administration, the US was categorised as the world’s top crude oil producer in 2018 and it maintained this position through 2021. U.S. oil refineries continue to obtain crude oil produced in the US and in other countries. There are different companies providing crude oil to the world market. In 2021, out of total U.S. crude oil production, Texas made a contribution of approximately 42.4%, while New Mexico and North Dakota made up approximately 11.1% and 9.9%, respectively.Research by US Energy Information Administration shows that despite total U.S. crude oil production falling between 1985 and 2008, its annual production saw an improvement nearly every year from 2009 through 2019. An increase in production, primarily in the states of Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Colorado, was brought about by the implementation of more advanced drilling techniques. However, crude oil production in the US saw a downfall in 2020 and 2021 principally due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Council on Foreign Relations highlighted that the US produces approximately 75% of its crude oil supply and 90% of its natural gas supply domestically. By the end of 2021, the country was producing around 100 billion cubic feet of gas per day and around 11 million barrels of crude oil per day.The US Energy Information Administration estimates that without major policy changes, U.S. oil and gas production should remain high through 2050. This estimate remains stable even after considering the warnings from climate scientists and international agreements promoting an immediate transition to renewable energy sources.In the latest December issue Short-Term Energy Outlook, EIA expects global oil inventories to decline 200,000 b/d in H1 2023 before they rise by approximately 700,000 b/d in H2 2023.Story continuesU.S. oil and gas industry is made up of several companies. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are considered as the biggest U.S.-based oil firms. Elsewhere, UK–based BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) have dominant position in the US.International Energy Agency (IEA), in their December issue oil market report, highlighted that global oil demand might contract by 110,000 b/d year-on-year in Q4 2022, touching 100.8 million b/d. This is up by 130,000 b/d against the agency’s report for November 2022. Strong gasoil use in main consuming countries surpasses weak European and Asian petrochemical deliveries. Despite seasonal slowdown in world oil demand and global challenges, recent oil consumption data exhibits optimism. This was mainly apparent in non-OECD regions, such as China, India and Middle East. As per IEA forecasts, oil demand should rise by 2.3 mb/d in 2022 and a further 1.7 mb/d next year.Goldman Sachs' Jeffrey Currie is quite optimistic about the outlook for commodities in 2023 principally due to recent trends being seen in China. Apart from this, he believes that the rebounding of PMIs in Europe and India should also lend support. China, which is the largest commodity consumer and largest oil importer in the world, is expected to lead the demand growth through much of 2023.With this in mind, let us have a look at 12 Best Oil Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds12 Best Oil Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Fundshuyangshu/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe used the latest holdings of The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) to short list oil stocks and then ranked these stocks using Insider Monkey's proprietary hedge fund sentiment data.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine and threats to hold natural gas exports hostage have spurred a surge in European energy prices, generating long-term agreements by European countries to purchase U.S. natural gas.This strong demand and elevated prices have helped EQT strengthen its balance sheet and position it to take advantage as opportunities emerge for natural gas to plug the gaps in the global energy transition from fossil fuels to renewables.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Oil Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds   Suggested articles:10 Biggest Nickel Mining Companies in the World20 Countries with the Largest Oil Reserves20 Biggest Oil Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None. 12 Best Oil Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey. ]"
28,56637c77-2028-3266-ae4a-f305f27022a5,MRO,2023-01-16,3 High-Growth Stocks With Multibagger Potential,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-high-growth-stocks-multibagger-201553214.html,1673554553,STORY,"['OXY', 'TH', 'MRO']","[Investors are clearly concerned about the current macroeconomic and geopolitical backdrop. Recent inflation-driven events have led us to a precarious place in the markets. Accordingly, with a potential recession on the horizon, few investors may be on the search for high-growth stocks. That makes sense. But, generally speaking, the time to buy beaten-down names is when they’re cheap.Of course, high-growth stocks in areas such as technology may continue to see declines in the year to come. As valuation compression takes hold and investors diversify into other areas of the economy, singularly-focused growth investors may continue to be hit.That said, I think there are pockets of the stock market worth exploring, such as energy and real estate, which most investors would not equate to growth areas, that provide some hefty bargains. Not only that, these companies tend to deliver significant bottom-line growth. And in this economy, profits matter more than anything else.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are three high-growth stocks I think are worth buying right now.OXYOccidental Petroleum$65.71THTarget Hospitality$18.06MROMarathon Oil$27.58Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) may not be included in a list of high-growth stocks for many investors, but it nevertheless deserves a look.Shares of this leading oil and gas player have performed pretty well so far this year, up more than 4%. This follows a 119% advance in 2022.A prominent Warren Buffett holding, Occidental has seen continued interest, even as energy prices have come down from their highs. It’s easy to see why Buffett is on the Occidental train. The company’s earnings growth has been impressive.Occidental is expected to report fourth-quarter and full-year results on Feb. 23. Analysts are predicting Q4 EPS of $1.97 and 2022 EPS of $9.83. If Occidental meets those targets, it will deliver year-over-year growth of 33% and 285%, respectively.Story continuesAccordingly, this is a stock I think deserves to be put in the high-growth bucket by long-term investors.Target Hospitality (TH)an empty, sunlit hotel roomSource: ShutterstockThe previously announced exchange offer for all of Target Hospitality’s (NASDAQ:TH) outstanding warrants has closed. For this leader in providing vertically integrated modular lodging and hospitality services, that’s a big positive investors are starting to price into the stock. Shares are up 19% since the start of the year.A total of 8,097,893 exercisable warrants (which includes 369,471 warrants tendered through assured delivery), representing approximately 50.1% of the warrants, were correctly tendered and not withdrawn in the offer. Target exchanged these warrants for 2,996,201 shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of the offer. That leaves 8,068,656 warrants still outstanding after the offer has closed.For the third quarter, Target Hospitality posted record quarterly revenue of $159.6 million, an increase of 79% from the corresponding period in 2021. For the same period, net income of $19 million surged 184% from a year ago.Currently, Target Hospitality stock is trading around the $18 level with the potential to go much higher this year.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil Logo at the top of a mobile device.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comMarathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is another top energy name making this list of high-growth stocks to buy. Like Occidental, the company’s bottom-line growth prospects are what makes it worth buying. So far this year, shares are up around 2% after gaining 67% in 2022.I think the company’s upcoming earnings report, scheduled for Feb. 15, may exceed investor expectations. Marathon is expected to earn 96 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2022, up 25% year over year. However, if it is able to produce similar bottom-line results to Occidental, this is a name that could get more love. Meanwhile, while Q4 revenue is expected to increase less than 2% compared with a year ago, full-year revenue is projected to surge nearly 46%.In addition, Marathon Oil recently disclosed that, after accounting for closing adjustments, it had successfully completed the acquisition of Ensign Natural Resources’ Eagle Ford assets for a total cash consideration of $3 billion. This is a key driver of bottom-line growth I think the market has yet to price in.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

Our goal is to bring more games to more people, and this deal will further that goal.""The U.S. software giant and Xbox maker announced the acquisition in January last year to help it compete better with leaders Tencent and Sony.U.S. and UK regulators, however, have voiced concerns, with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission going to court to block the deal.Microsoft was expected to offer remedies to EU regulators in an attempt to avert a statement of charge and shorten the regulatory process, other sources familiar with the matter told Reuters in November.The EU competition enforcer, however, is not expected to be open to remedies without first sending out its charge sheet, although there are ongoing informal discussions on concessions, the people said.Microsoft last month reached a 10-year deal with Nintendo to make ""Call of Duty"" available on Nintendo consoles, saying it was open to a similar agreement with Sony, which is critical of the acquisition.The deal has received the green light without conditions in Brazil, Saudi Arabia and Serbia.(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Mark Potter)]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest Ohio companies and stocks.The seventh most populous state in the U.S., Ohio has a GDP of over $656 billion. If it was a country, Ohio would be in the top 26 countries in the world ranked by GDP. In 2013, the state was ranked among the top 10 states for best business climate by Site Selection. It is also among the biggest states in the U.S. in terms of manufacturing, home to more than 12,000 manufacturers.Recognizing its allure for business headquarters, Ohio has taken significant actions to ensure that it continues to be an attractive proposition for companies. The state also offers performance-based incentives which are in place to assist companies that are either starting, relocating or expanding operations in Ohio. Some of these incentives include the job creation tax credit, which is a tax credit based on performance which is calculated as a percentage of the company's total payroll and credit is set against its commercial tax liability. Another such tax break is the DataCenter tax abatement, which allows a company to take advantage of either a partial of full sales tax exemption if you purchase eligible data center equipment. According to PwC, the state has also modified and enacted new tax incentive programs in the 2022 - 2023 budget such as allowing work from home employees to qualify for tax credits while taxpayers that qualify for megaprojects can receive additional tax benefits, which is great news for the 20 biggest Ohio companies and stocks.20 biggest Ohio companies and stocksPixabay / Public DomainIn addition to these tax credits, there are several loan and grant programs that companies can utilize especially for the development of emerging technologies and products and for businesses which are owned by minorities in the state. Recently, the Ohio Chamber of Commerce has been working on a proposal for a public private partnership that would provide incentives for people and corporations to move here.Story continuesThe job market in Ohio is strong too, even though there's still room for improvement. In August 2022 alone, the state added 7,500 jobs, adding more than 80,000 jobs over the past 12 months. Ohio's labor participation is close to 62%, while its unemployment rate is just 4.2% with total employment being over 5.5 million jobs, a strong recovery after total employment fell to under 4.8 million in April 2020 when the pandemic hit. The state is just over 100,000 jobs short of pre-pandemic levels.The 20 biggest Ohio companies and stocks include some of the biggest companies in the country. They have a combined revenue of more than $785 billion and a market cap exceeding $800 billion. We have taken revenue statistics from the latest Fortune 500 data while market cap has been taken from Yahoo Finance.

But more than that, you probably want to see it rise more than the market average. But Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 26% over five years, which is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is up just 0.7% in the last year.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Sysco In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Sysco achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 5.2% per year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 5% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Sysco has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Sysco, it has a TSR of 43% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Sysco shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 3.2% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 7% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Sysco better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  Sysco is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

That makes finding the best large-cap stocks a worthy exercise.Of course, in this market, it can be a challenge to identify the best large-cap stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDespite its recent rally, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still down nearly 6% in the last 12 months and other major indices are down more than that. So, you just can’t throw darts at a board to find your winners.For this list, I use my Portfolio Grader exclusive tool to find the best large-cap stocks to buy.The Portfolio Grader assigns stocks a letter grade based on fundamentals such as sales growth and operating margin. It factors in buying pressure and other quantitative factors that help predict a stock’s future performance.Here are seven large-cap stocks to buy and hold that get strong ratings from the Portfolio Grader.ETEnergy Transfer$12.67LNGCheniere Energy$153.90OXYOccidental Petroleum$65.69SQMSociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile$85.33ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$87.25AFLAflac$72.14APAAPA Corporation$45.44Energy Transfer (ET)An image of a hand holding a light bulb wrapped in leaves, surrounded by green energy source iconsSource: maeching chaiwongwatthana/ShutterstockEnergy stocks had a great 2022 and look destined for a solid 2023. Oil prices remain elevated, and Russia’s war in Ukraine is keeping pressure on the European market.Energy Transfer (NYSE:ET) operates about 120,000 miles of pipelines in North America, transporting about 30% of crude oil and gas in the United States across 41 states.ET stock is up 37% over the last year, including a 10% gain in the last month that corresponded with the easing of oil prices. Even when the price of oil is dropping, Energy Transfer stock is doing well which is why it’s among the best large-cap stocks to buy right now.But even as Energy Transfer easily topped analysts’ expectations of 26 cents earnings per share by recording 35 cents EPS, the company’s revenue numbers fell short. Analysts had expected $24.04 billion in revenue, more than 5% higher that ET posted.Story continuesIs that a sign of trouble for Energy Transfer? I don’t think so. The stock still has an incredibly cheap valuation of 6.8 times forward earnings, and it provides a dividend yield of more than 8%.ET stock may not give you the crazy returns of 2022, but it’s still worth a spot in your portfolio. It currently has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Cheniere Energy (LNG)Aerial drone photo of LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) tanker anchored in small LNG industrial islet of Revithoussa equipped with tanks for storage, Salamina, Greece.Source: Aerial-motion / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for a smaller energy company, Cheniere Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:LNG) may be the stock for you.As European customers are looking for stable supplies after they were cut off from Russian oil and gas, Cheniere is in an enviable position.It shipped 70% of its production to European customers in the first three quarters of 2022 and expected that to continue through the winter.The company posted revenue in the third quarter of $8.8 billion, which was a 175% increase from a year ago. LNG stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) rode the energy stock wave to greater heights in 2022, rising 130% on the year. But what’s really interesting about Occidental is its ambitious plans to combat greenhouse gas emissions and global warming.Occidental is investing in carbon capture technology that would allow it to remove as much as 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere a year.If it is successful in its goal, such a service would be in high demand from nation-states and companies that will be eager to slow or even reverse global warming.OXY stock also is pretty cheap, with a price-earnings ratio of only 8.5. Analysts give it a consensus price target of more than $76, which would indicate a potential 19% upside.OXY stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM)a pile of lithiumSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.comMoving down to South America, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) is an interesting materials stock that is best known for its mining of lithium – the raw material critical in powering electric vehicles, mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras and other things that need a battery.Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile happens to be the largest producer of lithium in the world. The demand for lithium is expected to increase from 500,000 metric tons in 2021 to 1.5 million in 2025, and then to 3 million metric tons by 2030.Surprisingly, SQM seems to be flying under the radar. Despite gains of 74% in the last year, SQM stock has a price-earnings ratio of only 4.5. Analysts give it more than 30% additional upside in the next year.SQM stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) logo on sign at office campusSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comArcher-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) has been able to profit from the rising cost of food attributed to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The stock is up 23% in the last year, and that’s even after a pretty sharp pullback in the last month.Investors may be overly considered that ADM stock would be hurt by a recession in the U.S., but I think those fears are overblown.Commodities companies like ADM would be a safer haven than a company that produces goods that aren’t considered necessary – and food is about as necessary of a product as you can find.Earnings in the third quarter included revenue of $24.68 billion and EPS of $1.86, beating top- and bottom-line estimates of $22.22 in revenue and EPS of $1.41. ADM stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Aflac (AFL)the Aflac (AFL) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAflac (NYSE:AFL) is not a traditional insurer. But thanks to its memorable marketing campaigns that feature a duck quacking out the Aflac name, Aflac may be one of the best-known insurers on the market.If you think that people will try to stretch their dollars and skimp on insurance while trying to cover their bases with Aflac, then AFL stock may be a solid bet.But be warned – the insurance space can be somewhat volatile. AFL stock brought in $4.82 billion in revenue in the third quarter, but that was actually a drop of nearly 8% over the last year. And while the company beat expectations on revenue its EPS of $1.15 missed estimates of $1.22.AFL stock does provide a solid dividend yield of 2.3% and I think it makes a good long-term bet. It has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.APA Corporation (APA)Momentum stocks: Natural gas pipeline through green field with blue sky aboveSource: ShutterstockIf you’re not familiar with APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA), don’t feel bad. APA isn’t a household name because it’s actually a holding company for Apache Energy, which is in the hydrocarbon exploration business. Apache moved to the APA structure in 2021.As Apache, the company operates in the U.S., as well as Egypt and the North Sea. APA also has subsidiaries in Suriname and the Dominican Republic.While the company enjoyed a lot of success in early 2022 from Russia’s war with Ukraine, the stock’s growth slowed substantially over the last six months as U.S. natural gas production increased and Europe had warmer-than-usual weather.However, if China regains its footing this year, as expected, then APA should see demand for natural gas to rise as well. And that should be a strong catalyst for APA stock.In the third quarter, APA recorded revenue of $2.87 billion and earnings per share of $1.97, both better than expectations of $2.32 billion in revenue and EPS of $1.74. APA stock also pays a dividend yield of 2.4%.APA has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in ET, LNG, OXY, SQM and ADM.

There are so many possibilities; it’s hard to pick just seven.The S&amp;P 500 is coming off one of its worst years in history. In 2022, the index’s total return was -18.11%. Only on six occasions since 1926 did the index do worse than this past year.In December, the index lost 5.90%, excluding dividends, putting an exclamation point on a rotten year. Compared to some of the other monthly losses, its nearly 6% decline was middle-of-the-road alarming.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInterestingly, heading into December, the S&amp;P 500 had delivered two consecutive months of healthy gains. It was up 7.99% in October and 5.38% in November. However, a third successive monthly gain was just too much to ask from the stock market gods.  The seven best stocks to buy in January are companies whose businesses are performing reasonably well and whose stocks are on a roll. These companies posted a total return of at least 10% over the past three months through Jan. 10, are are likely to keep the momentum going into February and beyond. BBWIBath &amp; Body Works$46.14NUENucor$155.71HCAHCA Healthcare$255.15ELEstee Lauder$262.25SPGIS&amp;P Global$367.77XPOXPO Logistics$37.76TSCOTractor Supply$220.74Bath &amp; Body Works (BBWI)A Bath &amp; Bodyworks storefrontSource: ShutterstockBath &amp; Body Works (NYSE:BBWI) has a three-month total return of 35.1%. Its three-year total return is 46.7%. On Nov. 16, the company raised its guidance for the 2022 fiscal year. Previously, its earnings estimate was $2.85 per share at the midpoint of its guidance. It now expects EPS of $3.10 at the midpoint. “We are continuing to stay close to our customer, and we remain disciplined in our expense and inventory management,” its Q3 2022 press release stated. “Long-term, we are confident in the fundamentals and potential of our business, and we are excited for Bath &amp; Body Works’ next growth chapter as we officially welcome global personal care and beauty industry veteran, Gina Boswell, as the company’s next Chief Executive Officer in December.”Story continuesBBWI stock jumped on the positive third-quarter results and guidance. Earlier in November, the company announced its new Chief Executive Officer. Gina Boswell is an executive with more than 30 years of experience, including eight at Unilever (NYSE:UL). Between consumers cutting back on spending and shifting toward more experiential products and services, Bath &amp; Body Works braces for lower demand. However, it’s important to remember that it’s facing 2021 comparables that were record-breaking due to Covid-19. As a result, a return to more normal buying patterns was expected. Trading at 1.4-times sales, BBWI stock is still reasonably-priced, despite its gains in the past three months. I wouldn’t be surprised if the momentum continued well into 2023.Nucor (NUE)Steel stocks: rods, bars and other forms of steelSource: ShutterstockNucor (NYSE:NUE) has a three-month total return of 28.5%. Its three-year total return is 43.7%. I’ve admired the North Carolina steel producer for some time. In March 2022, I recommended it, along with nine other S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. I also recommended NUE stock in September 2021. I thought it was among the best stocks that were down, but not out. In mid-September, the company’s shares tumbled after it announced that its Q3 2022 earnings would be significantly below Wall Street estimates and lower than those from the second quarter. Within a couple of weeks, its shares had fallen to $100. When Nucor reported its Q3 2022 results on Oct. 20, they were better than the company’s September guidance, to $6.50 a share, 10 cents above the high end of its range. “Nucor has already achieved a record-breaking year for earnings per share through the first nine months of 2022 and we continue to believe that we will set a new record for full-year earnings in 2022,” stated its Oct. 20 press release.In recent weeks, analysts have been warming to the innovative steel producer. On Jan. 4, Bank of America reinstated coverage of NUE stock with a buy rating and a $172 price target.  There is no question that the company’s results will moderate from the past year’s record results. Nucor’s return on invested capital is more than double its five-year average of 18.57%.  In my opinion, despite the company likely reverting to the mean over the next 6-12 months, Nucor remains an excellent long-term buy.  HCA Healthcare (HCA)two doctors look over a piece of paper while standing in a hallwaySource: ShutterstockHCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) has a three month total return of 26.1%. Its three-year total return is 19.8%.The 25 analysts that cover the hospital operator give it an average overweight rating with a target price of $255.45. Its return on invested capital is 16.31%, while its earnings yield is 7.09%,. That’s reasonable, if not historically low, for one of the best stocks in this space right now. On Jan. 3, HCA finalized its deal to sell three New Orleans-area hospitals to LCMC Health for $150 million, after obtaining approval from the Louisiana Department of Justice to do the transaction. Nurses represented by National Nurses United opposed the sale, as it would leave New Orleans with a duopoly between LCMC and Ochsner Health System. For the country’s largest hospital owner, the sale of the three hospitals is part of its recycling of assets. In 2021, the company sold 50 home health locations and five hospitals for $1.62 billion. It has one hospital left in Louisiana. That will likely be sold soon enough.HCA finished the third quarter with 182 hospitals, down from 183 a year ago. It also had 125 freestanding outpatient surgery centers, up from 123 in Q2 2022. Nevertheless, it’s a revenue-generating machine with $44.74 billion year-to-date through Q3 2022, 2.4% higher than a year ago.Despite higher costs, the company still made $2.90 billion in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) profits in the quarter, an EBITDA margin of nearly 20%. HCA has a 27.2% market share in some of America’s biggest growth markets. This makes it an excellent long-term play.Estee Lauder (EL)An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comEstee Lauder (NYSE:EL) has a three month total return of 21.3%. Its three-year total return is 8.3%. Estee Lauder remains one of the best long-term holds in the consumer discretionary sector. I’ve liked it for years. I first recommended the stock to InvestorPlace readers in November 2012. Every time the stock approached $50 on the downside, investors should be buying.From my November 2012 article to the stock’s all-time high of $374.20 hit in January 2022, EL stock gained 545%. So despite losing nearly 23% over the past year, it’s still gained a bunch for shareholders over the past decade.In September, Goldman Sachs analyst Jason English upgraded Estee Lauder to a Buy from Neutral with a $303 price target. “[Estee Lauder] is arguably emerging from Covid as a stronger business than when it entered the pandemic,” Barron’s reported the analyst’s comments.I couldn’t agree more. On Jan. 10, several media outlets reported that fashion designer Tom Ford bought a $51 million mansion in Palm Beach. But, of course, it’s easy to do that when you sell your brand to Estee Lauder for $2.8 billion. Estee Lauder beat out Kering (OTCMKTS:PPRUY), the owner of several luxury brands, including Gucci, Balenciaga, and Yves Saint Laurent, to buy the Ford brand in November. Estee Lauder struck preemptively to ensure it retained the Tom Ford Beauty brand license. It is the company’s largest acquisition in its history, and remains one of the best stocks to buy in the consumer discretionary space.S&amp;P Global (SPGI)Screenshot through a magnifying glass of the official website of the company S&amp;P Global (SPGI)Source: AntonSAN / Shutterstock.comS&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI) has a three month total return of 18.9%. Its three-year total return is 8.0%. The financial services company consistently makes my lists of the best stocks to buy. Most recently, I included it as one of three stocks with high growth and margins. However, you wouldn’t think that, looking at its operating margins for the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 30. They were in the mid-40% range, due to significantly lower revenues from its S&amp;P Global Ratings segment in 2022.Long-term investors shouldn’t be worried by the company’s near-term slowdown. Instead, it’s a function of the current state of the markets. Once another bull market takes hold, the unit’s revenues will head significantly higher. The 22 analysts that cover S&amp;P Global give it an average buy rating with a target price of $395.65. Its return on invested capital is 13.34%, considerably below its five-year average of 42.74%, while its earnings yield is 3.34%, in line with its five-year average. On Dec. 1, the company presented its medium-term financial targets at its 2022 Investor Day. It expects to grow organic revenues by 7-9% annually over the next four years with adjusted operating margins of 48-50%. “We have full confidence in our ability to achieve these ambitious medium-term targets, which reflect the resilience of our financial model, the ability to accelerate growth and innovation by continued investments, and our focus to deliver unparalleled value for our customers,” said S&amp;P Global Chief Financial Officer Ewout Steenbergen. Analysts see EPS in 2022 of $11.12 and $12.59 in 2023. Accordingly, this stock is trading action 28.1-times its 2023 earnings. XPO Logistics (XPO)Self-driving truck stocks: a self-driving truck on the roadSource: Mike Mareen / ShutterstockXPO Logistics (NYSE:XPO) has a three month total return of 14.3%. Its three-year total return is 12.6%. XPO CEO Brad Jacobs is a legend in the trucking industry. He’s also got a good sense of humor. Jacobs appeared in a Yahoo Finance interview in October, where he talked about his company’s spinoff of RXO (NYSE:RXO), its automated freight brokerage business, and his next big challenge. Bloomberg had this to say about the billionaire:“The billionaire chief executive officer of XPO Logistics Inc. is hunting for a new industry in which to invest after spending just more than a decade building  a company that jumped in market value to about $10 billion from about $160 million. He’s now splitting XPO into three parts and, for the most part, exiting the business,” Bloomberg contributor Thomas Black wrote on Oct. 17. At the same time Jacobs looks for his next adventure, he’ll remain Chairman of XPO, GXO Logistics (NYSE:GXO), which it spun off in 2021, and RXO, which will get spun off in the next month.Most everything Jacobs touches turns to gold. Indeed, XPO has a lot to do with him getting this reputation, and is the key reason this is one of the best stocks in this space. I expect it to continue to perform over the long haul.The 23 analysts that cover XPO give it an average buy rating with a target price of $43.95. Its return on invested capital is 18.2%, while its earnings yield is 20.56%, easily its highest in the past decade. Tractor Supply (TSCO)A Tractor Supply Co. StoreSource: ShutterstockTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) has a three month total return of 13.8%. Its three-year total return is 35.9%.The specialty retailer reported Q3 2022 results in October. Despite missing analyst estimates of $3.29 billion in revenue for the quarter by $20 million, this company remains one of the best stocks in retail. Additionally, on the bottom line, its earnings per share were $2.10, three cents higher than the consensus. “Tractor Supply delivered another record quarter as we continued to gain market share and extended our trend of consistent and stable net sales and earnings growth,” stated CEO Hal Lawton in its Q3 2022 press release.The 33 analysts that cover Tractor Supply give it an average overweight rating with a target price of $232.34. Its return on invested capital for the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 24, 2022, was 17.80%, while its earnings yield is 4.23%, in line with its five-year average. Around the same time Tractor Supply reported its Q3 2022 results, it completed its $320 million acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home. Tractor Supply is taking 81 of the family-owned specialty retailer’s locations. The other 85 have been sold to two buyers for $72 million. In addition, it is selling Orsheln’s corporate headquarters and distribution center to one of the buyers of the discarded stores for $10 million. Tractor Supply will ultimately pay $238 million or $2.94 million per store.TSCO continues to be one of the best growth stories in retail.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like American International Group (NYSE:AIG). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. View our latest analysis for American International Group How Fast Is American International Group Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Over the last three years, American International Group has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. As a result, we'll zoom in on growth over the last year, instead. Impressively, American International Group's EPS catapulted from US$6.44 to US$18.47, over the last year. It's not often a company can achieve year-on-year growth of 187%. That could be a sign that the business has reached a true inflection point.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Not all of American International Group's revenue this year is revenue from operations, so keep in mind the revenue and margin numbers used in this article might not be the best representation of the underlying business. The music to the ears of American International Group shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 16% to 31% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.Story continuesIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for American International Group's future profits.Are American International Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$48b company like American International Group. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$89m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. This would indicate that the goals of shareholders and management are one and the same.Is American International Group Worth Keeping An Eye On?American International Group's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. That sort of growth is nothing short of eye-catching, and the large investment held by insiders should certainly brighten the view of the company. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering American International Group for a spot on your watchlist. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 2 warning signs for American International Group (1 is potentially serious!) that you should be aware of.Although American International Group certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest California Companies and Stocks.California is not just the most populous state in the U.S. with over 39 million residents, but it is also the largest economy in the U.S., with its 2021 GDP worth over $3.4 trillion. Texas is the next biggest with a GDP of just over $2 billion, which shows how wide the gap between the first and the second biggest state is. Just for some perspective on how truly large the economy of California is, it is the biggest subnational economy in the world. If California was a country, it would be the 4th largest economy in the world, surpassed only by China, Germany and Japan!25 biggest California companies and stocksstellamc/Shutterstock.comCalifornia is home to Silicon Valley which is considered to be the technological hub of the world, with many of the biggest tech companies in the world headquartered there, including some of the biggest California companies and stocks. More than 30 businesses in the Fortune 1000 are headquartered in Silicon Valley not to mention thousands of startup companies which are headquartered in the region to take advantage of the wealth of talent not to mention venture capital. After all, around a third of the total venture capital fund in the U.S. is spent in Silicon Valley.Of course, the tech industry isn't the only industry in the state worth over $3.4 trillion. Finance, manufacturing and business sectors are all important contributors to the economy of California while its agricultural output is the highest of any state in the country. Some of the biggest media companies are also located in the state, which shouldn't be surprising. After all, Los Angeles, home to Hollywood, is also located in California. Overall, unemployment in the state is at 4.1%, an increase of 0.1% from October despite almost 27,000 nonfarm payroll jobs being added. However, the state is in a much better situation compared to November 2021 when the unemployment rate was 5.8%.Story continuesOf course, it isn't all doom and gloom for companies in California as the state does provide several financial incentives for businesses including consulting and low-cost training pertaining to loans and grants, startup business plans, strengthening operations and entering new markets among others. While taxes are comparatively high in the state, companies are also provided tax incentive programs which are presented to encourage innovation, development and growth.California is a Democratic state, and unlike most Republican states, it imposes high taxes on corporations to derive revenue that is used to fund the state's budget. Because of this difference in tax rates, many companies have started to move their headquarters from California, with perhaps the most recent high profile move being Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which moved its headquarters to Texas from California, something that Elon Musk had been threatening for a while. According to a report from the Hoover Institution, the rate of companies leaving California in 2021 was twice that of 2020 and 2019, and three times that of 2018, which includes 11 Fortune 1,000 companies. With costs being exceptionally high in the state, many other companies might follow suit in a bit to reduce costs.MethodologyTo determine the biggest California companies and stocks, we first found out the 25 top companies by revenue headquartered in California from Fortune 500 and then determined their latest market cap from Yahoo Finance. In what has been a volatile year especially for tech stocks, which are well-represented among the largest companies in California, which is why the top 25 stocks in the state had an average loss of 20% over the previous year. We then assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap for our rankings. So, let's take a look at the giants of the biggest subnational economy in the world, starting with number 25:25.

The economy continues to struggle with inflation and a strong employment market. Those factors have led the Federal Reserve to hike rates at unprecedented speed. But a slowdown in wage growth signals that the Fed’s efforts are having their intended effect. Slowing wage growth means the Fed may be able to slow its aggressive actions lessening the chances of a more severe downturn. In turn, normalization is possible paving the way for undervalued retail stocks to return. Consumerism is a vital part of the U.S. economy. The data suggests that consumers continue to be well-funded due to excess savings accumulated during the pandemic. According to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), between $1.2 to $1.8 trillion of the $2 to $2.4 trillion in excess savings accumulated during the pandemic remains.This glut of excess savings should help boost these seven undervalued retail stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsJanuary’s Undervalued Retail Stocks: Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO) Stand up paddle boarding on a quiet sea with warm summer sunset colors, close-up of legsSource: NicoElNino / ShutterstockAcademy Sports and Outdoors (NASDAQ:ASO) is an outdoor recreation and sporting goods retailer that originated in Texas and has expanded to 18 states. The company continues to grow relative to pre-pandemic business levels. The company exceeded its pre-pandemic performance on all major fundamental measures. That said, the company recently reported Q3 earnings including sales of $1.49 billion, 6.2% lower on a year-over-year basis. Despite the decline in sales, the company raised its EPS guidance for the full year. That should signal to investors that the company believes it has turned the corner, perhaps along with the broader economy. Academy Sports and Outdoors continues to expand its eCommerce operations with sales increasing 10.5% during the quarter. That represented the fifth consecutive period in which it recorded double-digit eCommerce sales growth. Story continuesAnother strong sign from the company comes in the form of operating income. ASO’s operating income through the first three quarters of 2022 surpassed its combined total operating income from fiscal years 2019 and 2020. Lululemon (LULU)the lululemon (LULU) logo on a mosaic-style wallSource: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.comInvestors ought to recognize Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) stock for the bargain it is. Its share prices remain muted despite its strong performance. Lululemon simply continues to improve along all of the important fundamental measures. But the specter of recession and reduced economic activity continue to drag it down. Investors should concern themselves with the fact that Lululemon has done extraordinarily well in a difficult 2022. It saw revenue increase by 28% during the period. North American revenues increased by 26% while international revenue growth reached 41%.  Lululemon’s net income increased by 36% in both the third quarter and through the first nine months of the year. Investors should expect the company to continue to do well moving forward: It has the intention to double 2021 revenues from $6.25 billion to $12.5 billion by 2026. Despite those aggressive growth plans, the company continues to direct cash away from growth directives, instead rewarding investors by repurchasing 54.6 thousand of its own shares.January’s Undervalued Retail Stocks: TJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.Source: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.comTJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is doing a strong job of dealing with overarching difficulties. That strong performance translated to stronger-than-anticipated earnings. Given recent strong news about wage growth, TJX should again find its way onto investors’ radars. TJX continued to grow through the first nine months of 2022. It reported both top-line revenue growth and bottom-line net profit growth. That is laudable in what was a tough year for every sector outside of energy. But what’s really impressive about TJX is its performance in Q3. Because while sales declined 2.9% YoY to $12.166 billion, the company eeked out higher profits. The company saw net income increase by 3.91%, rising to $1.062 billion in Q3. Making more profit out of smaller revenues is not an easy task.    The company’s holiday season performance remains to be seen. Speaking anecdotally, they may have been strong as I personally shopped at T.J. Maxx and Home Goods. My personal experience remains irrelevant but its Q3 performance does not. Coupang (CPNG) A close-up shot of a Coupang (CPNG) delivery vehicle.Source: Ki young / Shutterstock.comCoupang (NASDAQ:CPNG) stock was a Wall Street darling for a brief moment during its initial public offering (IPO). Then the realities of the company became more apparent and it fell dramatically costing many investors significant sums of capital in the process. But it has reached a significant turning point in a relatively unnoticed fashion. That leaves it undervalued currently while it continues to grow rapidly. The South Korean e-commerce giant was a massive failure following its IPO. Mania ensnared the company’s U.S. debut when it raised prices from the high $20s to the mid $30s just prior to its IPO. Suddenly its pre-IPO prices shot up to $60 before debuting at $48. They would only continue to fall thereafter. Investors were enamored with its impressive growth but had ignored its consistent and significant losses well into the hundreds of millions. It basically fell off the radar because of those losses. But the company posted a respectable net income of $91 million in Q3 on $5.1 billion in revenues. The company is now profitable for the first time in its publicly-traded life. Investors haven’t caught on because the company doesn’t command much media coverage. That makes it a diamond in the rough worth buying.January’s Undervalued Retail Stocks: Target (TGT)tgt stockSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comTarget (NYSE:TGT) stock remains undervalued by Wall Street and others. Analysts with coverage believe TGT stock has roughly $15 of upside beyond its current $160 price. Pure fundamental research site Gurufocus pegs TGT stock’s value at a significantly higher: $228.TGT stock remains discounted after disappointing third-quarter results. The firm’s growth was lacking relative to larger rivals and demand miscalculations led to excess inventory. Inflation and recession concerns only hurt Target further late in 2022. That raises a question for investors: Is Target likely to rebound in the future, or have a few missteps in 2022 sent it into long-term decline? If you agree with the former notion, there’s a lot to like about Target. Its 3-year revenue growth rate of 15% is near the top 10% of all retailers. It is particularly impressive in consideration of company size. Target’s EBITDA growth during the same period of 25.1% is also impressive and suggests there’s little to worry about overall.Advance Auto Parts (AAP)The outside of an Advanced Auto Parts storefront.Source: James R. Martin / ShutterstockIf you follow the advice of Cox senior economist Charlie Chesbrough, Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) stock appears to be a strong buy. Chesbrough believes there will be no appreciable uptick in U.S. auto sales in 2023 due to affordability. He believes that the only factor that could increase sales is a decision by auto executives to lower prices. But many auto execs have vowed not to offer such discounts at the risk of decreasing profitability.That implies that the aging U.S. vehicle fleet will continue to age further in 2023. In turn, Advance Auto Parts should see strong demand as those older vehicles break down more often.Advance Auto Parts has essentially held steady from a fundamental business perspective during 2023. Its top-line expectations did not change between Aug. 24 and Nov. 15. However, EPS guidance did fall lower. Regardless, the company has a powerful catalyst in its favor and that makes it investment worthy currently.January’s Undervalued Retail Stocks: Farfetch (FTCH)farfetch (FTCH) logo next to a hangerSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.comRounding out this list of undervalued retail stocks is Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH), a rapidly growing e-commerce luxury platform. Although the company hasn’t experienced that same rapid growth of late, its outlook remains positive. The company’s most recent earnings release shows that the company’s revenues increased moderately, by 1.9%, to reach $593.36 million. That growth rate is far slower than the 28% 3-year revenue growth rate the company experienced. But experts remain positive about the outlook for the firm as that rapid growth has allowed the company to remain on track to double over the last three years. The company is expected to reach a breakeven point by the end of this year. Analysts remain upbeat on the luxury platform the e-commerce firm has developed. It sells high-ticket designer items that boast high margins. The company itself posted a gross profit margin of 44.9% in Q3 and will benefit from secular trends that favor luxury goods. FTCH stock trades below $5 but carries an average target price near $12. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest California Companies and Stocks.California is not just the most populous state in the U.S. with over 39 million residents, but it is also the largest economy in the U.S., with its 2021 GDP worth over $3.4 trillion. Texas is the next biggest with a GDP of just over $2 billion, which shows how wide the gap between the first and the second biggest state is. Just for some perspective on how truly large the economy of California is, it is the biggest subnational economy in the world. If California was a country, it would be the 4th largest economy in the world, surpassed only by China, Germany and Japan!25 biggest California companies and stocksstellamc/Shutterstock.comCalifornia is home to Silicon Valley which is considered to be the technological hub of the world, with many of the biggest tech companies in the world headquartered there, including some of the biggest California companies and stocks. More than 30 businesses in the Fortune 1000 are headquartered in Silicon Valley not to mention thousands of startup companies which are headquartered in the region to take advantage of the wealth of talent not to mention venture capital. After all, around a third of the total venture capital fund in the U.S. is spent in Silicon Valley.Of course, the tech industry isn't the only industry in the state worth over $3.4 trillion. Finance, manufacturing and business sectors are all important contributors to the economy of California while its agricultural output is the highest of any state in the country. Some of the biggest media companies are also located in the state, which shouldn't be surprising. After all, Los Angeles, home to Hollywood, is also located in California. Overall, unemployment in the state is at 4.1%, an increase of 0.1% from October despite almost 27,000 nonfarm payroll jobs being added. However, the state is in a much better situation compared to November 2021 when the unemployment rate was 5.8%.Story continuesOf course, it isn't all doom and gloom for companies in California as the state does provide several financial incentives for businesses including consulting and low-cost training pertaining to loans and grants, startup business plans, strengthening operations and entering new markets among others. While taxes are comparatively high in the state, companies are also provided tax incentive programs which are presented to encourage innovation, development and growth.California is a Democratic state, and unlike most Republican states, it imposes high taxes on corporations to derive revenue that is used to fund the state's budget. Because of this difference in tax rates, many companies have started to move their headquarters from California, with perhaps the most recent high profile move being Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which moved its headquarters to Texas from California, something that Elon Musk had been threatening for a while. According to a report from the Hoover Institution, the rate of companies leaving California in 2021 was twice that of 2020 and 2019, and three times that of 2018, which includes 11 Fortune 1,000 companies. With costs being exceptionally high in the state, many other companies might follow suit in a bit to reduce costs.MethodologyTo determine the biggest California companies and stocks, we first found out the 25 top companies by revenue headquartered in California from Fortune 500 and then determined their latest market cap from Yahoo Finance. In what has been a volatile year especially for tech stocks, which are well-represented among the largest companies in California, which is why the top 25 stocks in the state had an average loss of 20% over the previous year. We then assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap for our rankings. So, let's take a look at the giants of the biggest subnational economy in the world, starting with number 25:25.

Therefore, if an investor wants direct exposure to the commodities that must increase in price to generate new supply (or incentivize other technologies), the only way to do so is by investing in commodity futures directly, according to Quantix.Commodity futures should be a core component in energy transition portfolios, as they are the cleanest, most direct way of gaining exposure to the expected demand increase for the materials essential for the transition. Commodity futures-based ETFs have the potential for returns that may come from the higher prices required to incentivize new production or new technologies, as well as the positive roll yield associated with commodities in tight supply.In addition, and crucially for allocators with existing commodity equity investments which are structurally short commodities, a commodity futures allocation can also act as a diversifying hedge, Quantix wrote.Story continuesAnother upside to commodity futures is that they immediately benefit from a changing supply and demand balance, whereas companies such as commodity products can take 10–15 years to respond with new production, especially in metals.While the end state of the energy transition is uncertain, some commodities (such as copper) will be necessary irrespective of which technology wins out. Demand for certain commodities (such as the platinum group metals) does depend more on the end state, but investing in companies is inherently a bet on which the underlying technologies wins out, Quantix wrote.RENW tracks the Quantix Energy Transition index, which includes commodities used in the net-zero end state (such as industrial metals and precious metals), commodities that will be used as transition fuels (such as natural gas and oilseeds), as well as the mechanism for pricing carbon during the transition (such as emissions).

There are so many possibilities; it’s hard to pick just seven.The S&amp;P 500 is coming off one of its worst years in history. In 2022, the index’s total return was -18.11%. Only on six occasions since 1926 did the index do worse than this past year.In December, the index lost 5.90%, excluding dividends, putting an exclamation point on a rotten year. Compared to some of the other monthly losses, its nearly 6% decline was middle-of-the-road alarming.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInterestingly, heading into December, the S&amp;P 500 had delivered two consecutive months of healthy gains. It was up 7.99% in October and 5.38% in November. However, a third successive monthly gain was just too much to ask from the stock market gods.  The seven best stocks to buy in January are companies whose businesses are performing reasonably well and whose stocks are on a roll. These companies posted a total return of at least 10% over the past three months through Jan. 10, are are likely to keep the momentum going into February and beyond. BBWIBath &amp; Body Works$46.14NUENucor$155.71HCAHCA Healthcare$255.15ELEstee Lauder$262.25SPGIS&amp;P Global$367.77XPOXPO Logistics$37.76TSCOTractor Supply$220.74Bath &amp; Body Works (BBWI)A Bath &amp; Bodyworks storefrontSource: ShutterstockBath &amp; Body Works (NYSE:BBWI) has a three-month total return of 35.1%. Its three-year total return is 46.7%. On Nov. 16, the company raised its guidance for the 2022 fiscal year. Previously, its earnings estimate was $2.85 per share at the midpoint of its guidance. It now expects EPS of $3.10 at the midpoint. “We are continuing to stay close to our customer, and we remain disciplined in our expense and inventory management,” its Q3 2022 press release stated. “Long-term, we are confident in the fundamentals and potential of our business, and we are excited for Bath &amp; Body Works’ next growth chapter as we officially welcome global personal care and beauty industry veteran, Gina Boswell, as the company’s next Chief Executive Officer in December.”Story continuesBBWI stock jumped on the positive third-quarter results and guidance. Earlier in November, the company announced its new Chief Executive Officer. Gina Boswell is an executive with more than 30 years of experience, including eight at Unilever (NYSE:UL). Between consumers cutting back on spending and shifting toward more experiential products and services, Bath &amp; Body Works braces for lower demand. However, it’s important to remember that it’s facing 2021 comparables that were record-breaking due to Covid-19. As a result, a return to more normal buying patterns was expected. Trading at 1.4-times sales, BBWI stock is still reasonably-priced, despite its gains in the past three months. I wouldn’t be surprised if the momentum continued well into 2023.Nucor (NUE)Steel stocks: rods, bars and other forms of steelSource: ShutterstockNucor (NYSE:NUE) has a three-month total return of 28.5%. Its three-year total return is 43.7%. I’ve admired the North Carolina steel producer for some time. In March 2022, I recommended it, along with nine other S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. I also recommended NUE stock in September 2021. I thought it was among the best stocks that were down, but not out. In mid-September, the company’s shares tumbled after it announced that its Q3 2022 earnings would be significantly below Wall Street estimates and lower than those from the second quarter. Within a couple of weeks, its shares had fallen to $100. When Nucor reported its Q3 2022 results on Oct. 20, they were better than the company’s September guidance, to $6.50 a share, 10 cents above the high end of its range. “Nucor has already achieved a record-breaking year for earnings per share through the first nine months of 2022 and we continue to believe that we will set a new record for full-year earnings in 2022,” stated its Oct. 20 press release.In recent weeks, analysts have been warming to the innovative steel producer. On Jan. 4, Bank of America reinstated coverage of NUE stock with a buy rating and a $172 price target.  There is no question that the company’s results will moderate from the past year’s record results. Nucor’s return on invested capital is more than double its five-year average of 18.57%.  In my opinion, despite the company likely reverting to the mean over the next 6-12 months, Nucor remains an excellent long-term buy.  HCA Healthcare (HCA)two doctors look over a piece of paper while standing in a hallwaySource: ShutterstockHCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) has a three month total return of 26.1%. Its three-year total return is 19.8%.The 25 analysts that cover the hospital operator give it an average overweight rating with a target price of $255.45. Its return on invested capital is 16.31%, while its earnings yield is 7.09%,. That’s reasonable, if not historically low, for one of the best stocks in this space right now. On Jan. 3, HCA finalized its deal to sell three New Orleans-area hospitals to LCMC Health for $150 million, after obtaining approval from the Louisiana Department of Justice to do the transaction. Nurses represented by National Nurses United opposed the sale, as it would leave New Orleans with a duopoly between LCMC and Ochsner Health System. For the country’s largest hospital owner, the sale of the three hospitals is part of its recycling of assets. In 2021, the company sold 50 home health locations and five hospitals for $1.62 billion. It has one hospital left in Louisiana. That will likely be sold soon enough.HCA finished the third quarter with 182 hospitals, down from 183 a year ago. It also had 125 freestanding outpatient surgery centers, up from 123 in Q2 2022. Nevertheless, it’s a revenue-generating machine with $44.74 billion year-to-date through Q3 2022, 2.4% higher than a year ago.Despite higher costs, the company still made $2.90 billion in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) profits in the quarter, an EBITDA margin of nearly 20%. HCA has a 27.2% market share in some of America’s biggest growth markets. This makes it an excellent long-term play.Estee Lauder (EL)An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comEstee Lauder (NYSE:EL) has a three month total return of 21.3%. Its three-year total return is 8.3%. Estee Lauder remains one of the best long-term holds in the consumer discretionary sector. I’ve liked it for years. I first recommended the stock to InvestorPlace readers in November 2012. Every time the stock approached $50 on the downside, investors should be buying.From my November 2012 article to the stock’s all-time high of $374.20 hit in January 2022, EL stock gained 545%. So despite losing nearly 23% over the past year, it’s still gained a bunch for shareholders over the past decade.In September, Goldman Sachs analyst Jason English upgraded Estee Lauder to a Buy from Neutral with a $303 price target. “[Estee Lauder] is arguably emerging from Covid as a stronger business than when it entered the pandemic,” Barron’s reported the analyst’s comments.I couldn’t agree more. On Jan. 10, several media outlets reported that fashion designer Tom Ford bought a $51 million mansion in Palm Beach. But, of course, it’s easy to do that when you sell your brand to Estee Lauder for $2.8 billion. Estee Lauder beat out Kering (OTCMKTS:PPRUY), the owner of several luxury brands, including Gucci, Balenciaga, and Yves Saint Laurent, to buy the Ford brand in November. Estee Lauder struck preemptively to ensure it retained the Tom Ford Beauty brand license. It is the company’s largest acquisition in its history, and remains one of the best stocks to buy in the consumer discretionary space.S&amp;P Global (SPGI)Screenshot through a magnifying glass of the official website of the company S&amp;P Global (SPGI)Source: AntonSAN / Shutterstock.comS&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI) has a three month total return of 18.9%. Its three-year total return is 8.0%. The financial services company consistently makes my lists of the best stocks to buy. Most recently, I included it as one of three stocks with high growth and margins. However, you wouldn’t think that, looking at its operating margins for the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 30. They were in the mid-40% range, due to significantly lower revenues from its S&amp;P Global Ratings segment in 2022.Long-term investors shouldn’t be worried by the company’s near-term slowdown. Instead, it’s a function of the current state of the markets. Once another bull market takes hold, the unit’s revenues will head significantly higher. The 22 analysts that cover S&amp;P Global give it an average buy rating with a target price of $395.65. Its return on invested capital is 13.34%, considerably below its five-year average of 42.74%, while its earnings yield is 3.34%, in line with its five-year average. On Dec. 1, the company presented its medium-term financial targets at its 2022 Investor Day. It expects to grow organic revenues by 7-9% annually over the next four years with adjusted operating margins of 48-50%. “We have full confidence in our ability to achieve these ambitious medium-term targets, which reflect the resilience of our financial model, the ability to accelerate growth and innovation by continued investments, and our focus to deliver unparalleled value for our customers,” said S&amp;P Global Chief Financial Officer Ewout Steenbergen. Analysts see EPS in 2022 of $11.12 and $12.59 in 2023. Accordingly, this stock is trading action 28.1-times its 2023 earnings. XPO Logistics (XPO)Self-driving truck stocks: a self-driving truck on the roadSource: Mike Mareen / ShutterstockXPO Logistics (NYSE:XPO) has a three month total return of 14.3%. Its three-year total return is 12.6%. XPO CEO Brad Jacobs is a legend in the trucking industry. He’s also got a good sense of humor. Jacobs appeared in a Yahoo Finance interview in October, where he talked about his company’s spinoff of RXO (NYSE:RXO), its automated freight brokerage business, and his next big challenge. Bloomberg had this to say about the billionaire:“The billionaire chief executive officer of XPO Logistics Inc. is hunting for a new industry in which to invest after spending just more than a decade building  a company that jumped in market value to about $10 billion from about $160 million. He’s now splitting XPO into three parts and, for the most part, exiting the business,” Bloomberg contributor Thomas Black wrote on Oct. 17. At the same time Jacobs looks for his next adventure, he’ll remain Chairman of XPO, GXO Logistics (NYSE:GXO), which it spun off in 2021, and RXO, which will get spun off in the next month.Most everything Jacobs touches turns to gold. Indeed, XPO has a lot to do with him getting this reputation, and is the key reason this is one of the best stocks in this space. I expect it to continue to perform over the long haul.The 23 analysts that cover XPO give it an average buy rating with a target price of $43.95. Its return on invested capital is 18.2%, while its earnings yield is 20.56%, easily its highest in the past decade. Tractor Supply (TSCO)A Tractor Supply Co. StoreSource: ShutterstockTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) has a three month total return of 13.8%. Its three-year total return is 35.9%.The specialty retailer reported Q3 2022 results in October. Despite missing analyst estimates of $3.29 billion in revenue for the quarter by $20 million, this company remains one of the best stocks in retail. Additionally, on the bottom line, its earnings per share were $2.10, three cents higher than the consensus. “Tractor Supply delivered another record quarter as we continued to gain market share and extended our trend of consistent and stable net sales and earnings growth,” stated CEO Hal Lawton in its Q3 2022 press release.The 33 analysts that cover Tractor Supply give it an average overweight rating with a target price of $232.34. Its return on invested capital for the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 24, 2022, was 17.80%, while its earnings yield is 4.23%, in line with its five-year average. Around the same time Tractor Supply reported its Q3 2022 results, it completed its $320 million acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home. Tractor Supply is taking 81 of the family-owned specialty retailer’s locations. The other 85 have been sold to two buyers for $72 million. In addition, it is selling Orsheln’s corporate headquarters and distribution center to one of the buyers of the discarded stores for $10 million. Tractor Supply will ultimately pay $238 million or $2.94 million per store.TSCO continues to be one of the best growth stories in retail.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest California Companies and Stocks.California is not just the most populous state in the U.S. with over 39 million residents, but it is also the largest economy in the U.S., with its 2021 GDP worth over $3.4 trillion. Texas is the next biggest with a GDP of just over $2 billion, which shows how wide the gap between the first and the second biggest state is. Just for some perspective on how truly large the economy of California is, it is the biggest subnational economy in the world. If California was a country, it would be the 4th largest economy in the world, surpassed only by China, Germany and Japan!25 biggest California companies and stocksstellamc/Shutterstock.comCalifornia is home to Silicon Valley which is considered to be the technological hub of the world, with many of the biggest tech companies in the world headquartered there, including some of the biggest California companies and stocks. More than 30 businesses in the Fortune 1000 are headquartered in Silicon Valley not to mention thousands of startup companies which are headquartered in the region to take advantage of the wealth of talent not to mention venture capital. After all, around a third of the total venture capital fund in the U.S. is spent in Silicon Valley.Of course, the tech industry isn't the only industry in the state worth over $3.4 trillion. Finance, manufacturing and business sectors are all important contributors to the economy of California while its agricultural output is the highest of any state in the country. Some of the biggest media companies are also located in the state, which shouldn't be surprising. After all, Los Angeles, home to Hollywood, is also located in California. Overall, unemployment in the state is at 4.1%, an increase of 0.1% from October despite almost 27,000 nonfarm payroll jobs being added. However, the state is in a much better situation compared to November 2021 when the unemployment rate was 5.8%.Story continuesOf course, it isn't all doom and gloom for companies in California as the state does provide several financial incentives for businesses including consulting and low-cost training pertaining to loans and grants, startup business plans, strengthening operations and entering new markets among others. While taxes are comparatively high in the state, companies are also provided tax incentive programs which are presented to encourage innovation, development and growth.California is a Democratic state, and unlike most Republican states, it imposes high taxes on corporations to derive revenue that is used to fund the state's budget. Because of this difference in tax rates, many companies have started to move their headquarters from California, with perhaps the most recent high profile move being Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which moved its headquarters to Texas from California, something that Elon Musk had been threatening for a while. According to a report from the Hoover Institution, the rate of companies leaving California in 2021 was twice that of 2020 and 2019, and three times that of 2018, which includes 11 Fortune 1,000 companies. With costs being exceptionally high in the state, many other companies might follow suit in a bit to reduce costs.MethodologyTo determine the biggest California companies and stocks, we first found out the 25 top companies by revenue headquartered in California from Fortune 500 and then determined their latest market cap from Yahoo Finance. In what has been a volatile year especially for tech stocks, which are well-represented among the largest companies in California, which is why the top 25 stocks in the state had an average loss of 20% over the previous year.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Illinois Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Illinois would be the 21st largest economy in the world. It is the fifth largest state in the U.S. with a GDP of around $950 billion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The state is also considered to have one of the most diversified economies in the entire world which is reflected in the 25 biggest Illinois companies and stocks. Even though our list doesn't have a lot of financial companies, Illinois is a major financial center in the U.S. Its economy is majorly centered in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, which is one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the country and is home to many major companies which you're likely familiar with.25 biggest Illinois companies and stocksHenryk Sadura/Shutterstock.comIllinois is known for its manufacturing and service sectors, but it also has a significant agriculture industry that produces a majority of the state's crops, particularly in rural areas outside of the Chicago metropolitan area. Meanwhile, manufacturing accounts for around 15% of Illinois' total output and is among the leading Midwest states in renewable energy, which signifies potential for investment in the state.One of the biggest concerns right now for Illinois is its unemployment rate, which at 4.7%, is currently the second-highest in the U.S. after Nevada. This is mainly because of the state's sluggish recovery from the pandemic as opposed to most other states that are almost at pre-pandemic levels. The economic outlook for Illinois is uncertain in 2022 due to rising inflation and interest rates, and the possibility of a recession in 2023. This makes the immediate future for the state less optimistic. Because of the state's position right now where it still hasn't completely recovered from the pandemic, if a recession is to hit (and it is almost a certainty that it will), then it will be one of the worst affected states in the country.Story continuesLike most states, Illinois provides several benefits and incentives to entice businesses to establish themselves in Illinois, either through incorporation or through relocation. The MICRO Act provides incentives to companies which are engaged in the semiconductor and microchip company while the Reimagining Electric Vehicles Program provides several incentives for businesses which are engaged in the manufacturing of electric vehicles and EV component parts. Meanwhile, the Illinois Angel Investment Tax Credit Program allows for investment in innovative companies at their early stages and help them obtain working capital.The 25 biggest Illinois companies and stocks are some of the most famous in the U.S. with a combined revenue of $940 billion and a combined market cap of $1.6 trillion.

Some of these incentives include the job creation tax credit, which is a tax credit based on performance which is calculated as a percentage of the company's total payroll and credit is set against its commercial tax liability. Another such tax break is the DataCenter tax abatement, which allows a company to take advantage of either a partial of full sales tax exemption if you purchase eligible data center equipment.

Airbus and Boeing had no immediate comment.United Airlines recently ordered 200 large and small aircraft. China last year placed a block order for Airbus jets.""We do expect a number of airlines will place large orders and again most of these orders will be for replacement,"" Udvar-Hazy said.He predicted airlines would increasingly turn back towards medium-sized wide-body jets after significant delays in the development of Boeing's largest new model, the 400-seat 777X - currently running at five years and potentially rising further.""We expect that both OEMs will be under pressure in the next couple of years to increase production rates, not necessarily back to the levels they were in 2018, but certainly well above current production.""

And that trend is not improving,"" he told the Airline Economics conference.""We do expect continued delays this year ... I can speak from our own experience that both (planemakers) are struggling to meet their contractual commitments.""Udvar-Hazy also raised questions over underlying production targets at Airbus and Boeing.""There is a big difference between aspiration and reality and we have seen every prediction that both OEMs made on (production) and they've not met them,"" he said.""They're a victim of a very complex supply chain. It's not just the first tier suppliers, it's the second, third, fourth. It could be a little mom and pop shop that makes something and if they can't deliver it, you can't get a title, get a certificate.""Airbus has said it plans to produce 75 single-aisle jets a month by the middle of the decade, up from about 45 now.""I think the 75 per month, it could be achieved at some point ... but when will they achieve it? That's the question. Boeing used to build 42 737s, two every working day for many years, and they're struggling right now to even build 30,"" Udvar-Hazy said.""So I'm much more realistic in anticipating this and I don't think they'll meet their production targets this year or next year - they'd like to, but they won't be able to.""On the demand side, Udvar-Hazy said there were more positive than negative factors despite concerns over the economy, with airline bookings in many cases surpassing 2019 levels.""I do see some positive signs that the industry is going to stabilize, barring any unforeseen external shocks, and we're hopefully on the road to a multi-year recovery cycle.""

Chief Executive Guillaume Faury flagged that the supply chain was still ""fragile"" heading into 2023.However, Airbus' annual deliveries were higher than major U.S. rival Boeing Co (NYSE:BA) for the fourth straight year. In November, Boeing laid out plans to turn around its performance, which has taken a hit since two fatal crashes of its 737 Max plane in 2018 and 2019.Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun also told investors last April that the delivery of its giant new 777X jet will be pushed back until at least 2025. Deliveries are a key figure for jet makers because much of the total purchase price is paid by airlines when they are completed.

If you want to skip our analysis of the plastic industry, you can go directly to 5 Largest Plastic Manufacturing Companies in the World.The plastic manufacturing industry produces a variety of plastic products for a range of different uses, from packaging to construction materials. Plastic is widely used in many industries because it is lightweight, durable, and cost-efficient. Plastic manufacturing typically involves the use of injection molding, extrusion, and blow molding processes, among others. Injection molding involves forcing molten plastic into a mold to create a desired shape. Extrusion involves forcing plastic through a die to create a continuous shape. Blow molding involves blowing air into a plastic container or bottle to create a desired shape. The industry also uses a variety of secondary processes, such as painting, machining, and assembly. Companies may also offer custom services, such as designing and creating molds and dies for specific products.The Global Plastic Industry: An AnalysisAccording to a market research report by Grand View Research, the global plastic industry was worth $593 billion in 2021. The industry is projected to grow to $811.57 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of 3.7%, from 2022 to 2030.Favorable demand trends for plastic products from lucrative end-markets such as consumer electronics, construction, and automotive are expected to drive this growth. The use of plastics as a substitute for metal is another prominent growth driver. Moreover, increased construction activities in emerging markets, such as India and China, is driving the growth of the plastic manufacturing industry.By product type, Polyethylene held the dominant market share of the global plastic market in 2021, and accounted for over 25% of global revenue. Polyethylene is widely used in packaging materials such as containers and bags. Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, or ABS, is another popular plastic product that is primarily used in consumer goods and electronics.Story continuesAs mentioned above, plastic is manufactured through a variety of processes. However, the injection molding process held the dominant market share and accounted for over 43% of the global demand for plastics in 2021.  Injection molding is the go-to process for the production of medical devices and automotive parts.In 2021, the APAC region held the largest revenue share of the global plastic market and accounted for 44% of global revenue. With rapid urbanization and the growth of emerging economies, the APAC region is expected to retain its position through the forecasted period.Some of the largest companies in the world, such as Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), all rely heavily on plastics. Automotive, medical devices, electronics, aviation, construction, and packaging, are some of the biggest markets for plastic manufacturing. Companies operating in these industries are expected to drive the growth of the global plastics market as they look for light-weight and cost-effective solutions.15 Largest Plastic Manufacturing Companies in the WorldPhoto by Nick Fewings on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe sifted through market research reports and identified the major players operating in the plastic manufacturing industry.

65,7b33cdb7-453f-35f8-b762-b872215973a2,PFE,2023-01-16,"In China, no easy way to get Pfizer's COVID drug Paxlovid",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/china-no-easy-way-pfizers-031817462.html,1673839097,STORY,['PFE'],"[By Sophie Yu and Martin Quin PollardBEIJING, Jan 16 (Reuters) - When Li's 83-year-old father with diabetes started coughing and complaining of body aches last month, the Beijing resident became anxious about finding a treatment for COVID-19 in case his parent had caught the virus sweeping the city.He heard at that time that Pfizer's anti-viral drug Paxlovid was an effective treatment, but patients could only get it prescribed if they were admitted to hospital, and only if the drug was in stock.The first hospital they visited conducted a CT scan that showed his lungs were infected, but turned them away, saying no beds were available, said Li, who only gave his surname due to sensitivity over how authorities might view his account.After two more days of frantic calls to families and friends, a contact finally found them a space at another hospital, but it took a further antigen test and second CT scan before it agreed to prescribe the drug.With his father admitted to an intensive care unit, Li was worried that it had taken too long to get effective treatment.""I’m not sure if Paxlovid can help him. I think it's because when he got the medicine he already had the virus for a week,"" Li told Reuters on Jan.12.""Now we can do little but pray.""His father died the same day.Li's experience, local media reports and online posts bear testimony to the difficulties faced obtaining Paxlovid in China through official channels.Paxlovid - a combination of two anti viral drugs - is one of the few foreign oral treatments approved by Beijing and a clinical trial has found it to have reduced hospitalisations in high-risk patients by around 90%.Having been approved in February last year, Paxlovid was scarcely used in China until December when the government started lifting its strict containment policy, and wave of COVID infections began to build.RAMPING UP SUPPLIESChinese authorities have acknowledged that supplies of Paxlovid are still insufficient to meet demand, even as Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla said last week that thousands of courses of the treatment were shipped to the country last year and in the past couple of weeks millions more were shipped.Story continues""Pfizer is actively collaborating with Chinese authorities and all stakeholders to secure an adequate supply of Paxlovid in China. We remain committed to fulfilling the COVID-19 treatment needs of Chinese patients and partnering with the Chinese government,"" the company said in a statement.Racing to defend against a rising death toll, China has also approved Merck &amp; Co's COVID antiviral drug and is reviewing a treatment developed by Japan's Shionogi.Paxlovid is covered by state insurance -- albeit temporarily until the end of March -- meaning patients in theory would only need to pay 198 yuan ($29), a tenth of its usual price.But China doesn't provide data on how many treatment courses are supplied and where it can be purchased, forcing most patients to rely on media reports, word-of-mouth or even importing through unauthorised channels in the grey market.Those who do manage to find a supplier often end up paying exorbitant prices, as demand has shot up amid a giant wave of COVID-19 infections.The official Guangzhou Daily reported that patients at the United Family Healthcare hospital in Guangdong were paying 6,000 yuan ($891) for health checks before being allowed to get Paxlovid priced at 2,300 yuan at the hospital.The hospital did not immediately reply to a Reuters' request for comment.Health data firm Airfinity estimated in December that China would need 49 million courses of the COVID treatment over the next five months, with over 22 million needed in January alone.The Pfizer drug can be also purchased for 2,170 yuan with prescription via online platforms, but it typically sells out within seconds.PAXLOVID GIFTSeveral other people described to Reuters how they turned to the grey market to purchase Paxlovid. Some were looking to treat sick relatives, while others wanted it just in case.Chen Jun, a resident of China's southern Hainan Province, said he bought Paxlovid from a supplier introduced by a business partner, who said the medicine was coming from Hong Kong.Chen paid 20,000 yuan ($2,972) on Jan. 2 for two boxes for his elderly parents, who suffer from cancer, and he said that some people had paid double that price.""You'll think it cheap once your family members are in need, because anything is better than going to a hospital now,"" he said. ""I know people who paid 20,000 yuan for one box of the medicine.""Another buyer who gave his name as Ray said he managed to get two boxes from the United States, where supplies are still ample and a doctor's prescription can be obtained after an online consultation.""It's very straightforward, they don't ask questions,"" he said. Having made the online purchase, he then asked a friend there to help courier it to China.An analyst at a Chinese securities house, who requested anonymity because of sensitivities over the subject, said his boss went to Hong Kong to stock up on Paxlovid to gift clients as it was more valued than a popular, expensive liquor.""It is a better gift than Moutai.""

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest California Companies and Stocks.California is not just the most populous state in the U.S. with over 39 million residents, but it is also the largest economy in the U.S., with its 2021 GDP worth over $3.4 trillion. Texas is the next biggest with a GDP of just over $2 billion, which shows how wide the gap between the first and the second biggest state is. Just for some perspective on how truly large the economy of California is, it is the biggest subnational economy in the world. If California was a country, it would be the 4th largest economy in the world, surpassed only by China, Germany and Japan!25 biggest California companies and stocksstellamc/Shutterstock.comCalifornia is home to Silicon Valley which is considered to be the technological hub of the world, with many of the biggest tech companies in the world headquartered there, including some of the biggest California companies and stocks. More than 30 businesses in the Fortune 1000 are headquartered in Silicon Valley not to mention thousands of startup companies which are headquartered in the region to take advantage of the wealth of talent not to mention venture capital. After all, around a third of the total venture capital fund in the U.S. is spent in Silicon Valley.Of course, the tech industry isn't the only industry in the state worth over $3.4 trillion. Finance, manufacturing and business sectors are all important contributors to the economy of California while its agricultural output is the highest of any state in the country. Some of the biggest media companies are also located in the state, which shouldn't be surprising. After all, Los Angeles, home to Hollywood, is also located in California. Overall, unemployment in the state is at 4.1%, an increase of 0.1% from October despite almost 27,000 nonfarm payroll jobs being added. However, the state is in a much better situation compared to November 2021 when the unemployment rate was 5.8%.Story continuesOf course, it isn't all doom and gloom for companies in California as the state does provide several financial incentives for businesses including consulting and low-cost training pertaining to loans and grants, startup business plans, strengthening operations and entering new markets among others. While taxes are comparatively high in the state, companies are also provided tax incentive programs which are presented to encourage innovation, development and growth.California is a Democratic state, and unlike most Republican states, it imposes high taxes on corporations to derive revenue that is used to fund the state's budget. Because of this difference in tax rates, many companies have started to move their headquarters from California, with perhaps the most recent high profile move being Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which moved its headquarters to Texas from California, something that Elon Musk had been threatening for a while. According to a report from the Hoover Institution, the rate of companies leaving California in 2021 was twice that of 2020 and 2019, and three times that of 2018, which includes 11 Fortune 1,000 companies. With costs being exceptionally high in the state, many other companies might follow suit in a bit to reduce costs.MethodologyTo determine the biggest California companies and stocks, we first found out the 25 top companies by revenue headquartered in California from Fortune 500 and then determined their latest market cap from Yahoo Finance. In what has been a volatile year especially for tech stocks, which are well-represented among the largest companies in California, which is why the top 25 stocks in the state had an average loss of 20% over the previous year.

If you want to skip the detailed analysis about the oil industry, go directly to 5 best oil stocks to buy according to hedge funds.As per US Energy Information Administration, the US was categorised as the world’s top crude oil producer in 2018 and it maintained this position through 2021. U.S. oil refineries continue to obtain crude oil produced in the US and in other countries. There are different companies providing crude oil to the world market. In 2021, out of total U.S. crude oil production, Texas made a contribution of approximately 42.4%, while New Mexico and North Dakota made up approximately 11.1% and 9.9%, respectively.Research by US Energy Information Administration shows that despite total U.S. crude oil production falling between 1985 and 2008, its annual production saw an improvement nearly every year from 2009 through 2019. An increase in production, primarily in the states of Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Colorado, was brought about by the implementation of more advanced drilling techniques. However, crude oil production in the US saw a downfall in 2020 and 2021 principally due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Council on Foreign Relations highlighted that the US produces approximately 75% of its crude oil supply and 90% of its natural gas supply domestically. By the end of 2021, the country was producing around 100 billion cubic feet of gas per day and around 11 million barrels of crude oil per day.The US Energy Information Administration estimates that without major policy changes, U.S. oil and gas production should remain high through 2050. This estimate remains stable even after considering the warnings from climate scientists and international agreements promoting an immediate transition to renewable energy sources.In the latest December issue Short-Term Energy Outlook, EIA expects global oil inventories to decline 200,000 b/d in H1 2023 before they rise by approximately 700,000 b/d in H2 2023.Story continuesU.S. oil and gas industry is made up of several companies. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are considered as the biggest U.S.-based oil firms. Elsewhere, UK–based BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) have dominant position in the US.International Energy Agency (IEA), in their December issue oil market report, highlighted that global oil demand might contract by 110,000 b/d year-on-year in Q4 2022, touching 100.8 million b/d. This is up by 130,000 b/d against the agency’s report for November 2022. Strong gasoil use in main consuming countries surpasses weak European and Asian petrochemical deliveries. Despite seasonal slowdown in world oil demand and global challenges, recent oil consumption data exhibits optimism. This was mainly apparent in non-OECD regions, such as China, India and Middle East. As per IEA forecasts, oil demand should rise by 2.3 mb/d in 2022 and a further 1.7 mb/d next year.Goldman Sachs' Jeffrey Currie is quite optimistic about the outlook for commodities in 2023 principally due to recent trends being seen in China. Apart from this, he believes that the rebounding of PMIs in Europe and India should also lend support. China, which is the largest commodity consumer and largest oil importer in the world, is expected to lead the demand growth through much of 2023.With this in mind, let us have a look at 12 Best Oil Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds12 Best Oil Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Fundshuyangshu/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe used the latest holdings of The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) to short list oil stocks and then ranked these stocks using Insider Monkey's proprietary hedge fund sentiment data.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Illinois Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Illinois would be the 21st largest economy in the world. It is the fifth largest state in the U.S. with a GDP of around $950 billion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The state is also considered to have one of the most diversified economies in the entire world which is reflected in the 25 biggest Illinois companies and stocks. Even though our list doesn't have a lot of financial companies, Illinois is a major financial center in the U.S. Its economy is majorly centered in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, which is one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the country and is home to many major companies which you're likely familiar with.25 biggest Illinois companies and stocksHenryk Sadura/Shutterstock.comIllinois is known for its manufacturing and service sectors, but it also has a significant agriculture industry that produces a majority of the state's crops, particularly in rural areas outside of the Chicago metropolitan area. Meanwhile, manufacturing accounts for around 15% of Illinois' total output and is among the leading Midwest states in renewable energy, which signifies potential for investment in the state.One of the biggest concerns right now for Illinois is its unemployment rate, which at 4.7%, is currently the second-highest in the U.S. after Nevada. This is mainly because of the state's sluggish recovery from the pandemic as opposed to most other states that are almost at pre-pandemic levels. The economic outlook for Illinois is uncertain in 2022 due to rising inflation and interest rates, and the possibility of a recession in 2023. This makes the immediate future for the state less optimistic. Because of the state's position right now where it still hasn't completely recovered from the pandemic, if a recession is to hit (and it is almost a certainty that it will), then it will be one of the worst affected states in the country.Story continuesLike most states, Illinois provides several benefits and incentives to entice businesses to establish themselves in Illinois, either through incorporation or through relocation. The MICRO Act provides incentives to companies which are engaged in the semiconductor and microchip company while the Reimagining Electric Vehicles Program provides several incentives for businesses which are engaged in the manufacturing of electric vehicles and EV component parts.

The economy continues to struggle with inflation and a strong employment market. Those factors have led the Federal Reserve to hike rates at unprecedented speed. But a slowdown in wage growth signals that the Fed’s efforts are having their intended effect. Slowing wage growth means the Fed may be able to slow its aggressive actions lessening the chances of a more severe downturn. In turn, normalization is possible paving the way for undervalued retail stocks to return. Consumerism is a vital part of the U.S. economy. The data suggests that consumers continue to be well-funded due to excess savings accumulated during the pandemic. According to JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), between $1.2 to $1.8 trillion of the $2 to $2.4 trillion in excess savings accumulated during the pandemic remains.This glut of excess savings should help boost these seven undervalued retail stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsJanuary’s Undervalued Retail Stocks: Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO) Stand up paddle boarding on a quiet sea with warm summer sunset colors, close-up of legsSource: NicoElNino / ShutterstockAcademy Sports and Outdoors (NASDAQ:ASO) is an outdoor recreation and sporting goods retailer that originated in Texas and has expanded to 18 states. The company continues to grow relative to pre-pandemic business levels. The company exceeded its pre-pandemic performance on all major fundamental measures. That said, the company recently reported Q3 earnings including sales of $1.49 billion, 6.2% lower on a year-over-year basis. Despite the decline in sales, the company raised its EPS guidance for the full year. That should signal to investors that the company believes it has turned the corner, perhaps along with the broader economy. Academy Sports and Outdoors continues to expand its eCommerce operations with sales increasing 10.5% during the quarter. That represented the fifth consecutive period in which it recorded double-digit eCommerce sales growth. Story continuesAnother strong sign from the company comes in the form of operating income. ASO’s operating income through the first three quarters of 2022 surpassed its combined total operating income from fiscal years 2019 and 2020. Lululemon (LULU)the lululemon (LULU) logo on a mosaic-style wallSource: Richard Frazier / Shutterstock.comInvestors ought to recognize Lululemon (NASDAQ:LULU) stock for the bargain it is. Its share prices remain muted despite its strong performance. Lululemon simply continues to improve along all of the important fundamental measures. But the specter of recession and reduced economic activity continue to drag it down. Investors should concern themselves with the fact that Lululemon has done extraordinarily well in a difficult 2022. It saw revenue increase by 28% during the period. North American revenues increased by 26% while international revenue growth reached 41%.  Lululemon’s net income increased by 36% in both the third quarter and through the first nine months of the year. Investors should expect the company to continue to do well moving forward: It has the intention to double 2021 revenues from $6.25 billion to $12.5 billion by 2026. Despite those aggressive growth plans, the company continues to direct cash away from growth directives, instead rewarding investors by repurchasing 54.6 thousand of its own shares.January’s Undervalued Retail Stocks: TJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.Source: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.comTJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) is doing a strong job of dealing with overarching difficulties. That strong performance translated to stronger-than-anticipated earnings. Given recent strong news about wage growth, TJX should again find its way onto investors’ radars. TJX continued to grow through the first nine months of 2022. It reported both top-line revenue growth and bottom-line net profit growth. That is laudable in what was a tough year for every sector outside of energy. But what’s really impressive about TJX is its performance in Q3. Because while sales declined 2.9% YoY to $12.166 billion, the company eeked out higher profits. The company saw net income increase by 3.91%, rising to $1.062 billion in Q3. Making more profit out of smaller revenues is not an easy task.    The company’s holiday season performance remains to be seen. Speaking anecdotally, they may have been strong as I personally shopped at T.J. Maxx and Home Goods. My personal experience remains irrelevant but its Q3 performance does not. Coupang (CPNG) A close-up shot of a Coupang (CPNG) delivery vehicle.Source: Ki young / Shutterstock.comCoupang (NASDAQ:CPNG) stock was a Wall Street darling for a brief moment during its initial public offering (IPO). Then the realities of the company became more apparent and it fell dramatically costing many investors significant sums of capital in the process. But it has reached a significant turning point in a relatively unnoticed fashion. That leaves it undervalued currently while it continues to grow rapidly. The South Korean e-commerce giant was a massive failure following its IPO. Mania ensnared the company’s U.S. debut when it raised prices from the high $20s to the mid $30s just prior to its IPO. Suddenly its pre-IPO prices shot up to $60 before debuting at $48. They would only continue to fall thereafter. Investors were enamored with its impressive growth but had ignored its consistent and significant losses well into the hundreds of millions. It basically fell off the radar because of those losses. But the company posted a respectable net income of $91 million in Q3 on $5.1 billion in revenues. The company is now profitable for the first time in its publicly-traded life. Investors haven’t caught on because the company doesn’t command much media coverage. That makes it a diamond in the rough worth buying.January’s Undervalued Retail Stocks: Target (TGT)tgt stockSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comTarget (NYSE:TGT) stock remains undervalued by Wall Street and others. Analysts with coverage believe TGT stock has roughly $15 of upside beyond its current $160 price. Pure fundamental research site Gurufocus pegs TGT stock’s value at a significantly higher: $228.TGT stock remains discounted after disappointing third-quarter results. The firm’s growth was lacking relative to larger rivals and demand miscalculations led to excess inventory. Inflation and recession concerns only hurt Target further late in 2022. That raises a question for investors: Is Target likely to rebound in the future, or have a few missteps in 2022 sent it into long-term decline? If you agree with the former notion, there’s a lot to like about Target. Its 3-year revenue growth rate of 15% is near the top 10% of all retailers. It is particularly impressive in consideration of company size. Target’s EBITDA growth during the same period of 25.1% is also impressive and suggests there’s little to worry about overall.Advance Auto Parts (AAP)The outside of an Advanced Auto Parts storefront.Source: James R. Martin / ShutterstockIf you follow the advice of Cox senior economist Charlie Chesbrough, Advance Auto Parts (NYSE:AAP) stock appears to be a strong buy. Chesbrough believes there will be no appreciable uptick in U.S. auto sales in 2023 due to affordability. He believes that the only factor that could increase sales is a decision by auto executives to lower prices. But many auto execs have vowed not to offer such discounts at the risk of decreasing profitability.That implies that the aging U.S. vehicle fleet will continue to age further in 2023. In turn, Advance Auto Parts should see strong demand as those older vehicles break down more often.Advance Auto Parts has essentially held steady from a fundamental business perspective during 2023. Its top-line expectations did not change between Aug. 24 and Nov. 15. However, EPS guidance did fall lower. Regardless, the company has a powerful catalyst in its favor and that makes it investment worthy currently.January’s Undervalued Retail Stocks: Farfetch (FTCH)farfetch (FTCH) logo next to a hangerSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.comRounding out this list of undervalued retail stocks is Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH), a rapidly growing e-commerce luxury platform. Although the company hasn’t experienced that same rapid growth of late, its outlook remains positive. The company’s most recent earnings release shows that the company’s revenues increased moderately, by 1.9%, to reach $593.36 million. That growth rate is far slower than the 28% 3-year revenue growth rate the company experienced. But experts remain positive about the outlook for the firm as that rapid growth has allowed the company to remain on track to double over the last three years. The company is expected to reach a breakeven point by the end of this year. Analysts remain upbeat on the luxury platform the e-commerce firm has developed. It sells high-ticket designer items that boast high margins. The company itself posted a gross profit margin of 44.9% in Q3 and will benefit from secular trends that favor luxury goods. FTCH stock trades below $5 but carries an average target price near $12. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest California Companies and Stocks.California is not just the most populous state in the U.S. with over 39 million residents, but it is also the largest economy in the U.S., with its 2021 GDP worth over $3.4 trillion. Texas is the next biggest with a GDP of just over $2 billion, which shows how wide the gap between the first and the second biggest state is. Just for some perspective on how truly large the economy of California is, it is the biggest subnational economy in the world. If California was a country, it would be the 4th largest economy in the world, surpassed only by China, Germany and Japan!25 biggest California companies and stocksstellamc/Shutterstock.comCalifornia is home to Silicon Valley which is considered to be the technological hub of the world, with many of the biggest tech companies in the world headquartered there, including some of the biggest California companies and stocks. More than 30 businesses in the Fortune 1000 are headquartered in Silicon Valley not to mention thousands of startup companies which are headquartered in the region to take advantage of the wealth of talent not to mention venture capital. After all, around a third of the total venture capital fund in the U.S. is spent in Silicon Valley.Of course, the tech industry isn't the only industry in the state worth over $3.4 trillion. Finance, manufacturing and business sectors are all important contributors to the economy of California while its agricultural output is the highest of any state in the country. Some of the biggest media companies are also located in the state, which shouldn't be surprising. After all, Los Angeles, home to Hollywood, is also located in California. Overall, unemployment in the state is at 4.1%, an increase of 0.1% from October despite almost 27,000 nonfarm payroll jobs being added. However, the state is in a much better situation compared to November 2021 when the unemployment rate was 5.8%.Story continuesOf course, it isn't all doom and gloom for companies in California as the state does provide several financial incentives for businesses including consulting and low-cost training pertaining to loans and grants, startup business plans, strengthening operations and entering new markets among others. While taxes are comparatively high in the state, companies are also provided tax incentive programs which are presented to encourage innovation, development and growth.California is a Democratic state, and unlike most Republican states, it imposes high taxes on corporations to derive revenue that is used to fund the state's budget. Because of this difference in tax rates, many companies have started to move their headquarters from California, with perhaps the most recent high profile move being Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which moved its headquarters to Texas from California, something that Elon Musk had been threatening for a while. According to a report from the Hoover Institution, the rate of companies leaving California in 2021 was twice that of 2020 and 2019, and three times that of 2018, which includes 11 Fortune 1,000 companies. With costs being exceptionally high in the state, many other companies might follow suit in a bit to reduce costs.MethodologyTo determine the biggest California companies and stocks, we first found out the 25 top companies by revenue headquartered in California from Fortune 500 and then determined their latest market cap from Yahoo Finance. In what has been a volatile year especially for tech stocks, which are well-represented among the largest companies in California, which is why the top 25 stocks in the state had an average loss of 20% over the previous year. We then assigned 60% weightage to revenue and 40% to market cap for our rankings. So, let's take a look at the giants of the biggest subnational economy in the world, starting with number 25:25.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest California Companies and Stocks.California is not just the most populous state in the U.S. with over 39 million residents, but it is also the largest economy in the U.S., with its 2021 GDP worth over $3.4 trillion. Texas is the next biggest with a GDP of just over $2 billion, which shows how wide the gap between the first and the second biggest state is. Just for some perspective on how truly large the economy of California is, it is the biggest subnational economy in the world. If California was a country, it would be the 4th largest economy in the world, surpassed only by China, Germany and Japan!25 biggest California companies and stocksstellamc/Shutterstock.comCalifornia is home to Silicon Valley which is considered to be the technological hub of the world, with many of the biggest tech companies in the world headquartered there, including some of the biggest California companies and stocks. More than 30 businesses in the Fortune 1000 are headquartered in Silicon Valley not to mention thousands of startup companies which are headquartered in the region to take advantage of the wealth of talent not to mention venture capital. After all, around a third of the total venture capital fund in the U.S. is spent in Silicon Valley.Of course, the tech industry isn't the only industry in the state worth over $3.4 trillion. Finance, manufacturing and business sectors are all important contributors to the economy of California while its agricultural output is the highest of any state in the country. Some of the biggest media companies are also located in the state, which shouldn't be surprising. After all, Los Angeles, home to Hollywood, is also located in California. Overall, unemployment in the state is at 4.1%, an increase of 0.1% from October despite almost 27,000 nonfarm payroll jobs being added. However, the state is in a much better situation compared to November 2021 when the unemployment rate was 5.8%.Story continuesOf course, it isn't all doom and gloom for companies in California as the state does provide several financial incentives for businesses including consulting and low-cost training pertaining to loans and grants, startup business plans, strengthening operations and entering new markets among others. While taxes are comparatively high in the state, companies are also provided tax incentive programs which are presented to encourage innovation, development and growth.California is a Democratic state, and unlike most Republican states, it imposes high taxes on corporations to derive revenue that is used to fund the state's budget. Because of this difference in tax rates, many companies have started to move their headquarters from California, with perhaps the most recent high profile move being Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which moved its headquarters to Texas from California, something that Elon Musk had been threatening for a while. According to a report from the Hoover Institution, the rate of companies leaving California in 2021 was twice that of 2020 and 2019, and three times that of 2018, which includes 11 Fortune 1,000 companies. With costs being exceptionally high in the state, many other companies might follow suit in a bit to reduce costs.MethodologyTo determine the biggest California companies and stocks, we first found out the 25 top companies by revenue headquartered in California from Fortune 500 and then determined their latest market cap from Yahoo Finance. In what has been a volatile year especially for tech stocks, which are well-represented among the largest companies in California, which is why the top 25 stocks in the state had an average loss of 20% over the previous year.

Interest rate decisions in China and Japan are also in focus, with particular focus on the Bank of Japan after it unexpectedly struck a hawkish tone during its December meeting.Spot gold fell 0.1% to $1,918.49 an ounce, while gold futures were steady at $1,921.50 an ounce by 19:33 ET (00:33 GMT). Both instruments were close to their highest levels since May 2022.Still, trading volumes in metals markets are expected to be muted on Monday, on account of a U.S. holiday.Among industrial metals, copper prices retreated slightly on Monday after racing to a seven-month high last week. The red metal saw a large spike in bids amid growing expectations for a recovery in Chinese demand this year, after the country relaxed most of its strict anti-COVID restrictions.High-grade copper futures fell 0.3% to $4.2060 a pound, but are trading up over 10% so far this year.In addition to positive demand trends in China, which is the world’s largest consumer of copper, prices of the red metal are also expected to benefit from potential supply disruptions in major Latin American producers.Story continuesRelated ArticlesGold hovers around 8-mth high ahead of data-heavy weekEnergy &amp; precious metals - weekly review and outlookIranian oil exports end 2022 at a high, despite no nuclear deal]"
79,2036d874-bfaa-34c2-8f05-38d320665631,MAR,2023-01-16,RENW Fits as Core Component in Energy Transition Portfolios,ETF Trends,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/renw-fits-core-component-energy-163936633.html,1673627976,STORY,"['HG=F', 'PL=F', 'NG=F', 'GC=F']","[This article was originally published on ETFTrends.com.Over 90% of global GDP is committed to an energy transition, which calls for a massive expansion in renewable energy sources in the coming decades.Meeting these targets will require commodities that the world simply will not have at current production levels, and the availability of those materials does not seem to have been factored into any commitments.1Harnessing wind and solar energy, for example, requires far more metals and minerals than fossil fuel plants; for the equivalent MW (megawatt) of generation capacity, offshore wind plants require approx. 8 tons of copper while natural gas needs just 1.1 tons.2The simple economics of supply and demand argue that the world’s shortfall of these commodities can only be corrected by incentivizing greater production via higher commodity prices, according to Quantix.Despite the pivotal role that commodities play in the energy transition, equity investments in the space are still far more utilized by advisors than commodity futures-based products, such as the Harbor Energy Transition Strategy ETF (RENW).Equity investments all effectively short commodities one way or another. Therefore, if an investor wants direct exposure to the commodities that must increase in price to generate new supply (or incentivize other technologies), the only way to do so is by investing in commodity futures directly, according to Quantix.Commodity futures should be a core component in energy transition portfolios, as they are the cleanest, most direct way of gaining exposure to the expected demand increase for the materials essential for the transition. Commodity futures-based ETFs have the potential for returns that may come from the higher prices required to incentivize new production or new technologies, as well as the positive roll yield associated with commodities in tight supply.In addition, and crucially for allocators with existing commodity equity investments which are structurally short commodities, a commodity futures allocation can also act as a diversifying hedge, Quantix wrote.Story continuesAnother upside to commodity futures is that they immediately benefit from a changing supply and demand balance, whereas companies such as commodity products can take 10–15 years to respond with new production, especially in metals.While the end state of the energy transition is uncertain, some commodities (such as copper) will be necessary irrespective of which technology wins out. Demand for certain commodities (such as the platinum group metals) does depend more on the end state, but investing in companies is inherently a bet on which the underlying technologies wins out, Quantix wrote.RENW tracks the Quantix Energy Transition index, which includes commodities used in the net-zero end state (such as industrial metals and precious metals), commodities that will be used as transition fuels (such as natural gas and oilseeds), as well as the mechanism for pricing carbon during the transition (such as emissions). Since the theme is a global movement, the index includes commodities from the U.S., Europe, and the U.K.For more news, information, and analysis, visit the Market Insights Channel.1Quantix Commodities, LP, December 20222International Energy Agency, March 2022Investors should carefully consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a Harbor fund before investing. To obtain a summary prospectus or prospectus for this and other information, visit harborcapital.com or call 800-422-1050. Read it carefully before investing.All investments involve risk including the possible loss of principal.  Please refer to the Fund’s prospectus for additional risks: RENWCommodity and Commodity Linked Derivative Risk: The Fund has exposure to commodities through its and/or the Subsidiary’s investments in commodity-linked derivative instruments. The Fund’s investments in commodity-linked derivative instruments (either directly or through the Subsidiary) and the tracking of an Index comprised of commodity futures may subject the Fund to significantly greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. The Fund is non-diversified and may invest a greater concentrate of its assets in a particular sector of the commodities market (such as metal, gas or emissions products). As a result, the Fund may be more susceptible to risks associated with those sectors.Authorized Participant Concentration/Trading Risk: Only authorized participants (“APs”) may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the Fund.Energy Transition Risk: The commodities included in the Index may become less representative of energy transition trends over time and the Fund’s investments may be significantly impacted by government and corporate policies.Foreign Currency Risk: Because the Index may include futures contracts denominated in foreign currencies, the Fund could be subject to currency risk.The Quantix Energy Transition Index (QET) is an unmanaged index that maintains exposure to at least 10 commodities from its eligible universe of energy transition themes in the United States (U.S.), Canada, United Kingdom (U.K.) and other European exchanges. Commodity futures from the component candidates are selected for the Index and weighted based on QCI’s quantitative methodology. Under normal circumstances, the Index is rebalanced on a monthly basis. The index listed is unmanaged and does not reflect fees and expenses and is not available for direct investment.Positive roll yield is when a futures market is in backwardation which occurs when a futures contract trades at a higher price as it approaches expiration, compared to when the contract is further away from expiration.Quantix Commodities, LP is the subadvisor for the Harbor Energy Transition Strategy (RENW)This article was prepared as Harbor Funds paid sponsorship with VettaFI.Foreside Fund Services, LLC is the Distributor of the Harbor ETFs.2674349POPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COMSPY ETF QuoteVOO ETF QuoteQQQ ETF QuoteVTI ETF QuoteJNUG ETF QuoteTop 34 Gold ETFs Top 34 Oil ETFs Top 57 Financials ETFs Is The 60/40 Portfolio A Thing Of The Past?

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest California Companies and Stocks.California is not just the most populous state in the U.S. with over 39 million residents, but it is also the largest economy in the U.S., with its 2021 GDP worth over $3.4 trillion. Texas is the next biggest with a GDP of just over $2 billion, which shows how wide the gap between the first and the second biggest state is. Just for some perspective on how truly large the economy of California is, it is the biggest subnational economy in the world. If California was a country, it would be the 4th largest economy in the world, surpassed only by China, Germany and Japan!25 biggest California companies and stocksstellamc/Shutterstock.comCalifornia is home to Silicon Valley which is considered to be the technological hub of the world, with many of the biggest tech companies in the world headquartered there, including some of the biggest California companies and stocks. More than 30 businesses in the Fortune 1000 are headquartered in Silicon Valley not to mention thousands of startup companies which are headquartered in the region to take advantage of the wealth of talent not to mention venture capital. After all, around a third of the total venture capital fund in the U.S. is spent in Silicon Valley.Of course, the tech industry isn't the only industry in the state worth over $3.4 trillion. Finance, manufacturing and business sectors are all important contributors to the economy of California while its agricultural output is the highest of any state in the country. Some of the biggest media companies are also located in the state, which shouldn't be surprising. After all, Los Angeles, home to Hollywood, is also located in California. Overall, unemployment in the state is at 4.1%, an increase of 0.1% from October despite almost 27,000 nonfarm payroll jobs being added. However, the state is in a much better situation compared to November 2021 when the unemployment rate was 5.8%.Story continuesOf course, it isn't all doom and gloom for companies in California as the state does provide several financial incentives for businesses including consulting and low-cost training pertaining to loans and grants, startup business plans, strengthening operations and entering new markets among others. While taxes are comparatively high in the state, companies are also provided tax incentive programs which are presented to encourage innovation, development and growth.California is a Democratic state, and unlike most Republican states, it imposes high taxes on corporations to derive revenue that is used to fund the state's budget. Because of this difference in tax rates, many companies have started to move their headquarters from California, with perhaps the most recent high profile move being Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which moved its headquarters to Texas from California, something that Elon Musk had been threatening for a while. According to a report from the Hoover Institution, the rate of companies leaving California in 2021 was twice that of 2020 and 2019, and three times that of 2018, which includes 11 Fortune 1,000 companies. With costs being exceptionally high in the state, many other companies might follow suit in a bit to reduce costs.MethodologyTo determine the biggest California companies and stocks, we first found out the 25 top companies by revenue headquartered in California from Fortune 500 and then determined their latest market cap from Yahoo Finance. In what has been a volatile year especially for tech stocks, which are well-represented among the largest companies in California, which is why the top 25 stocks in the state had an average loss of 20% over the previous year.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Illinois Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Illinois would be the 21st largest economy in the world. It is the fifth largest state in the U.S. with a GDP of around $950 billion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The state is also considered to have one of the most diversified economies in the entire world which is reflected in the 25 biggest Illinois companies and stocks. Even though our list doesn't have a lot of financial companies, Illinois is a major financial center in the U.S. Its economy is majorly centered in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, which is one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the country and is home to many major companies which you're likely familiar with.25 biggest Illinois companies and stocksHenryk Sadura/Shutterstock.comIllinois is known for its manufacturing and service sectors, but it also has a significant agriculture industry that produces a majority of the state's crops, particularly in rural areas outside of the Chicago metropolitan area. Meanwhile, manufacturing accounts for around 15% of Illinois' total output and is among the leading Midwest states in renewable energy, which signifies potential for investment in the state.One of the biggest concerns right now for Illinois is its unemployment rate, which at 4.7%, is currently the second-highest in the U.S. after Nevada. This is mainly because of the state's sluggish recovery from the pandemic as opposed to most other states that are almost at pre-pandemic levels. The economic outlook for Illinois is uncertain in 2022 due to rising inflation and interest rates, and the possibility of a recession in 2023. This makes the immediate future for the state less optimistic. Because of the state's position right now where it still hasn't completely recovered from the pandemic, if a recession is to hit (and it is almost a certainty that it will), then it will be one of the worst affected states in the country.Story continuesLike most states, Illinois provides several benefits and incentives to entice businesses to establish themselves in Illinois, either through incorporation or through relocation. The MICRO Act provides incentives to companies which are engaged in the semiconductor and microchip company while the Reimagining Electric Vehicles Program provides several incentives for businesses which are engaged in the manufacturing of electric vehicles and EV component parts. Meanwhile, the Illinois Angel Investment Tax Credit Program allows for investment in innovative companies at their early stages and help them obtain working capital.The 25 biggest Illinois companies and stocks are some of the most famous in the U.S. with a combined revenue of $940 billion and a combined market cap of $1.6 trillion.

If you want to skip the detailed analysis about the oil industry, go directly to 5 best oil stocks to buy according to hedge funds.As per US Energy Information Administration, the US was categorised as the world’s top crude oil producer in 2018 and it maintained this position through 2021. U.S. oil refineries continue to obtain crude oil produced in the US and in other countries. There are different companies providing crude oil to the world market. In 2021, out of total U.S. crude oil production, Texas made a contribution of approximately 42.4%, while New Mexico and North Dakota made up approximately 11.1% and 9.9%, respectively.Research by US Energy Information Administration shows that despite total U.S. crude oil production falling between 1985 and 2008, its annual production saw an improvement nearly every year from 2009 through 2019. An increase in production, primarily in the states of Texas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, New Mexico, and Colorado, was brought about by the implementation of more advanced drilling techniques. However, crude oil production in the US saw a downfall in 2020 and 2021 principally due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Council on Foreign Relations highlighted that the US produces approximately 75% of its crude oil supply and 90% of its natural gas supply domestically. By the end of 2021, the country was producing around 100 billion cubic feet of gas per day and around 11 million barrels of crude oil per day.The US Energy Information Administration estimates that without major policy changes, U.S. oil and gas production should remain high through 2050. This estimate remains stable even after considering the warnings from climate scientists and international agreements promoting an immediate transition to renewable energy sources.In the latest December issue Short-Term Energy Outlook, EIA expects global oil inventories to decline 200,000 b/d in H1 2023 before they rise by approximately 700,000 b/d in H2 2023.Story continuesU.S. oil and gas industry is made up of several companies. Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) are considered as the biggest U.S.-based oil firms. Elsewhere, UK–based BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) and Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) have dominant position in the US.International Energy Agency (IEA), in their December issue oil market report, highlighted that global oil demand might contract by 110,000 b/d year-on-year in Q4 2022, touching 100.8 million b/d. This is up by 130,000 b/d against the agency’s report for November 2022. Strong gasoil use in main consuming countries surpasses weak European and Asian petrochemical deliveries. Despite seasonal slowdown in world oil demand and global challenges, recent oil consumption data exhibits optimism. This was mainly apparent in non-OECD regions, such as China, India and Middle East. As per IEA forecasts, oil demand should rise by 2.3 mb/d in 2022 and a further 1.7 mb/d next year.Goldman Sachs' Jeffrey Currie is quite optimistic about the outlook for commodities in 2023 principally due to recent trends being seen in China. Apart from this, he believes that the rebounding of PMIs in Europe and India should also lend support. China, which is the largest commodity consumer and largest oil importer in the world, is expected to lead the demand growth through much of 2023.With this in mind, let us have a look at 12 Best Oil Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds12 Best Oil Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Fundshuyangshu/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyWe used the latest holdings of The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE) to short list oil stocks and then ranked these stocks using Insider Monkey's proprietary hedge fund sentiment data.

Brands (NYSE:YUM) five years ago would have delivered you a 68% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-yum-brands-nyse-yum-110025238.html,1673866825,STORY,['YUM'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. To wit, the Yum! Brands share price has climbed 53% in five years, easily topping the market return of 37% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 4.5% , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Yum! Brands In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Over half a decade, Yum! Brands managed to grow its earnings per share at 5.9% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 9% per year, over the same period. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Yum! Brands, it has a TSR of 68% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Yum! Brands shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 4.5% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 11% per year, is even more impressive. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Yum! Brands better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Yum! Brands (2 shouldn't be ignored)  that you should be aware of.But note: Yum! Brands may not be the best stock to buy.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Illinois Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Illinois would be the 21st largest economy in the world. It is the fifth largest state in the U.S. with a GDP of around $950 billion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The state is also considered to have one of the most diversified economies in the entire world which is reflected in the 25 biggest Illinois companies and stocks. Even though our list doesn't have a lot of financial companies, Illinois is a major financial center in the U.S. Its economy is majorly centered in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, which is one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the country and is home to many major companies which you're likely familiar with.25 biggest Illinois companies and stocksHenryk Sadura/Shutterstock.comIllinois is known for its manufacturing and service sectors, but it also has a significant agriculture industry that produces a majority of the state's crops, particularly in rural areas outside of the Chicago metropolitan area. Meanwhile, manufacturing accounts for around 15% of Illinois' total output and is among the leading Midwest states in renewable energy, which signifies potential for investment in the state.One of the biggest concerns right now for Illinois is its unemployment rate, which at 4.7%, is currently the second-highest in the U.S. after Nevada. This is mainly because of the state's sluggish recovery from the pandemic as opposed to most other states that are almost at pre-pandemic levels. The economic outlook for Illinois is uncertain in 2022 due to rising inflation and interest rates, and the possibility of a recession in 2023. This makes the immediate future for the state less optimistic. Because of the state's position right now where it still hasn't completely recovered from the pandemic, if a recession is to hit (and it is almost a certainty that it will), then it will be one of the worst affected states in the country.Story continuesLike most states, Illinois provides several benefits and incentives to entice businesses to establish themselves in Illinois, either through incorporation or through relocation. The MICRO Act provides incentives to companies which are engaged in the semiconductor and microchip company while the Reimagining Electric Vehicles Program provides several incentives for businesses which are engaged in the manufacturing of electric vehicles and EV component parts. Meanwhile, the Illinois Angel Investment Tax Credit Program allows for investment in innovative companies at their early stages and help them obtain working capital.The 25 biggest Illinois companies and stocks are some of the most famous in the U.S. with a combined revenue of $940 billion and a combined market cap of $1.6 trillion. To determine these companies, we first selected the 25 companies headquartered in Illinois with the highest revenue taken from Fortune 500.

SkiftWhile many travel companies fret over delivering personalized recommendations to potential or existing customers through artificial intelligence and other technologies, Tripadvisor is supplementing those efforts the old-fashioned way — by emailing a quiz.Since using Tripadvisor eight days ago to research tour and activities options in Reykjavik, Iceland, I’ve literally received 10 unsolicited emails from the company with subject lines ranging from “Continue planning for Reykjavik” to “An iconic Reykjavik experience for you.” The torrent of emails, frankly, has been annoying, if not unusual as many companies do this.The latest email popped in this morning, prompting me to take the bait — “4 questions, 40 seconds,” it promised — to obtain personalized things to do in Iceland. It didn’t turn out badly, at all.Tripadvisor quiz things to do in IcelandI answered: 1) “Nope,” it is not my first visit to Iceland; 2) I’ll be traveling with friends; 3) I’m seeking an “action-packed” trip, and 4) I’m most interested in “the great outdoors.”Tripadvisor immediately recommended that I snowmobile the Langjökull Glacier, take a mountain helicopter tour, embark on a two-hour ATV adventure, or reserve a Golden Circle super-Jeep tour with snowmobiling.I then cheated and retook the quiz, opting this time for “laid back” outdoor adventures. This time Tripadvisor recommended a Lava Tunnel tour, Silfra drysuit snorkeling, a glacier hike, and a Northern Lights cruise.Each recommendation had a link to the particular activity among “things to do” on Tripadvisor — interestingly not on sister brand Viator — and there was the option to view more things to do beyond the four recommendations.Undoubtably Tripadvisor will use the quiz answers to give me recommendations in the future, although perhaps I screwed things up by taking the quiz twice and providing different answers.But at least the Tripadvisor quiz produced for me relevant tours and activities — unlike many other travel company recommendations, and tweets that Twitter recommends for me that I find personally abhorrent.Story continuesAlas, Tripadvisor’s quizzes are a smart way to bolster personalization within the context of other more tech-enhanced efforts.Sure, the Tripadvisor quiz wasn’t unique. While I was writing this story about the Tripadvisor quiz, I received a Skift Research survey for subscribers, asking me to take a six-minute survey to “help us understand what you want to see more of.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

One way you can implement such a strategy is by increasing your exposure to dividend-paying large-cap stocks.If you’re seeking safe harbors, plus the opportunity for long-term capital growth, these types of stocks fit the bill. The companies in this category are by-and-large venerable, established enterprises. They are well-positioned to continue paying out their current dividends, perhaps even increasing their payouts.These payouts provide a steady baseline of returns, in up and down markets. Beyond their appeal as income plays, these stocks also offer strong appreciation potential, when the stock begins to make a recovery.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, what are the best dividend-paying large-cap stocks to buy right now? Consider taking a closer look at these seven. Each of these stocks has a forward dividend yield of at least 3%, offering gradual growth potential over a long time frame.BMYBristol-Myers Squibb$71.60DOWDow Inc.$58.52FFord$13.43PMPhilip Morris International$101.44UPSUnited Parcel Service$182.95USBU.S. Bancorp$47.59VZVerizon Communications$41.81Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)Bristol-Myers (BMY) logo at the top of a cellphone.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for yield, value, and growth, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) is a great choice. Currently, this large-cap pharma stock sports a forward dividend yield of 3.2%. With six years of consecutive dividend growth, BMY has increased its payout by an average of 6.88% annually over the past five years.Indeed, BMY stock is arguably undervalued. Shares trade for just 9.4-times forecasted earnings for 2022. That’s slightly lower than other large-cap pharma stocks, which trade for between 10- and 15-times forward earnings. This valuation may also be too low, given the company’s projected future earnings growth.Story continuesAccording to UBS analyst Keith Parker, Bristol-Myers Squibb is expected to report compounded annual earnings per share (or EPS) growth of 13% over the next three years. Even if BMY maintains its current multiple, shares could still steadily climb higher, in tandem with higher earnings.Dow Inc. (DOW)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for one of the dividend-paying large-cap stocks with higher yields, consider Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW). Shares in this chemicals company have a forward dividend yield of 5%. Yes, this company has not raised its dividend since it was spun off from DuPont (NYSE:DD) in 2019.However, with a payout ratio of only 35.4%, its 70 cent per share quarterly payout is likely sustainable. Along with an above-average dividend yield, DOW stock also trades for just 8.8-times estimated 2022 earnings. Although earnings are expected to drop in 2023, even when you take this into account, DOW remains more-than reasonably-priced, at 13.1-times forward earnings.Furthermore, if energy prices (which have pressure on Dow’s margins) ease during 2023, the company’s earnings could come in ahead of expectations. With all this in mind, high-yield, low-priced DOW stock is a great choice for value-minded investors.Ford (F)Ford logo badge on grill of carSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comAs a recession looms, you may be questioning the merits of buying Ford (NYSE:F) stock today. However, while the post-pandemic boom times for automakers are now in the rearview mirror, and excitement over this “old school” car company’s move into electric vehicles (or EVs) has waned, Ford is still worthy of a buy.Why? First, even if earnings drop this year, they’ll likely be sufficient to maintain Ford’s current dividend, which was reinstated in 2021. Sell-side forecasts call for EPS of $1.71. The company’s current payout is 15 cents per quarter, or 60 cents per year (giving F stock a 4.5% forward yield).Also, despite fading “EV mania,” the vehicle electrification trend isn’t going away. Reporting strong EV sales during 2022, as it continues to successfully increase its presence in this fast-growing area of the auto market, excitement for F stock could rev back up again.Philip Morris International (PM)An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.comPhilip Morris International (NYSE:PM) is the world’s largest publicly-traded cigarette maker by market cap. However, Philip Morris, whose legacy business is the non-U.S. operations of its former corporate parent, Altria Group (NYSE:MO), is embracing a smoke-free future.That is, the Marlboro maker has made major progress bringing out non-combustible tobacco products, namely its IQOS heated tobacco product. PM is also increasing its exposure to the smokeless tobacco and nicotine products segment of the industry, with its purchase of Swedish Match (OTCMKTS:SWMAY).The company’s aggressive moves to adapt to changing tobacco use trends could help it sustain (and continue to grow) its high dividend. PM stock currently has a forward yield of 5%, and a 14-year track record of dividend growth. Since the spinoff from Altria in 2008, Philip Morris has raised its quarterly dividend by more than 235%, from 54 cents to $1.27.United Parcel Service (UPS)Close up of UPS logo printed on a delivery truck; partial view of the driver sitting at the wheel, waiting at a red traffic light in south San Francisco baySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) shares have floundered over the past year. This makes sense, given the challenging and uncertain economic climate. However, with shares in the package transportation company trading for only 14.7-times estimated 2023 earnings, the impact of an economic slowdown may already be baked into its valuation.As InvestorPlace‘s Alex Sirois recently argued, UPS remains a dominant company in the logistics industry, with a strong future. Once there’s an economic and stock market comeback, UPS stock will more-than-likely make a comeback as well. In the meantime, you can be paid to wait for a rebound, via UPS’s 3.3% dividend.While not the highest yield among the dividend-paying large-cap stocks, UPS has a solid dividend growth track record. The company has raised its payout 13 years in a row. Over the past five years, UPS’s dividend has gone up by an average of 12.86% annually.U.S. Bancorp (USB)A pink piggy bank wearing a grad cap sits on a wooden table in front of a chalkboard.Source: ShutterstockU.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is one of America’s largest financial institutions. Like other bank stocks, worries about the economy have put pressure on shares over the past year.However, USB stock has been trending higher more recently, and it could keep climbing. If recession worries ease, and higher interest rates result in earnings growth in 2023 (as expected per sell-side forecasts), investors could continue to dive back into the stock. Increased profitability resulting from higher interest rates is also a big positive when it comes to future dividend growth.USB already has a fairly high dividend. At current prices, the stock’s forward yield comes in at 4%. However, if earnings keep climbing, so too could USB’s quarterly payout. U.S. Bancorp raised its dividend by 13.5% in 2019, and by 9.5% in 2021. A similarly-sized increase may be in the cards this year.Verizon Communications (VZ)5G stocks, VZ stockSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comIt’s not inaccurate to say that telecom stocks like Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) have been “dividend traps” over the past year. A 6.2% payout (VZ’s forward yield) doesn’t look too appealing, when you weigh it against the stock’s 22.1% price decline over the past year.But while VZ stock has generated negative total returns over the past twelve months, things could play out a whole lot differently moving forward. In fact, shares in this major telecom company have already begun to bounce back, making a double-digit move higher in the past month, thanks to promising statements about subscriber growth made by CEO Hans Vestberg.Trading at a heavily-discounted 8.1-times estimated 2022 earnings, if Verizon can deliver better-than-expected results, shares could continue to climb back near prior price levels. Even a partial recovery, coupled with its high-yield payout, could produce fantastic total returns in 2023, for investors buying today.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel held MO.

101,cdfef8ef-8132-31a3-b5ba-747bb0911a42,AXP,2023-01-16,7 Best Nancy Pelosi Stocks to Buy in January,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-nancy-pelosi-stocks-202450585.html,1673555090,STORY,"['AXP', 'TSLA', 'GOOGL', 'MSFT', 'CRWD']","[Even though the former House Speaker and leader of the Democrats in the lower chamber of Congress stepped down after 20 years of service, it doesn’t mean that the best Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy lost much of their relevance. Indeed, Internet algorithms consistently point to this topic as one of the most popular regarding equities market queries.So, even if the matter seems outdated, we must give the American people what they want. And while nearly half of Americans had an unfavorable view of the Congresswoman back in Dec. last year, the topic of the best Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy seems almost sacrosanct. I guess it’s safe to say that folks hate the policies but love the stock picks. To be clear, nothing changed since the last time I covered the best Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy. So for this update, we’re going to focus on individual developments among the former Speaker’s bullish holdings.GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$91.90MSFTMicrosoft$237.90AXPAmerican Express$154.59ABAllianceBernstein$39.29TSLATesla$122.66CRWDCrowdStrike$97.72RBLXRoblox$32.88InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comOne of the most compelling names among the best Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy in my view, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) makes plenty of sense because of its vast technology dominance. Basically, the company owns the internet. Based on the latest data regarding the global search engine sector, Alphabet’s Google owns 92.6% market share. If you want to be known on the internet, you must appease the gatekeeper.According to the Clerk of the House of Representatives, on Sept. 16, the then-House Speaker exercised 200 call options that were purchased on Dec. 17, 2021, featuring a strike price of $100. Since the exercise date, GOOG gave up 11% of its equity value. For now, then, it’s not the politician’s brightest prospect. Nevertheless, over time, GOOG should serve investors well.Story continuesPerhaps most notably, analysts love GOOG stock. Among the nine experts covering the enterprise, all of them rate it a buy. Further, their average price target pings at $122.67, implying an upside potential of 33%. If that wasn’t enough, TipRanks notes that hedge fund sentiment for GOOG rates is very positive.Microsoft (MSFT)The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.Source: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.comA solid name all around, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) easily makes a case for being one of the best Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy. Fundamentally, the company dominates the business application ecosystem. For instance, regarding the global desktop operating system sector, Microsoft’s Windows commands over 75% market share. Basically, if you want to survive in the professional realm, you must be fluent in Microsoft.Per the records from the Clerk of the House of Representatives, the former House Speaker acquired MSFT stock via two transactions, both on May 24 of last year. In the first, Pelosi purchased 10 call options with a strike price of $180. On the second, she purchased 40 call options with a strike price of $180. Both options expire on June 16, 2023. As with Alphabet above, Wall Street loves MSFT stock. Out of 29 analysts, 26 of them rate shares as a buy. The three remaining experts rate it a hold, thus giving Microsoft a consensus strong buy view. As well, the average price target is $286.13, implying an upside potential of over 21%.American Express (AXP)the American Express logo etched into woodSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.comA financial institution specializing in payment card services, American Express (NYSE:AXP) makes for an intriguing case among the best Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy. On one hand, the erosion of consumer sentiment implies that many folks will tighten their belts. That wouldn’t necessarily help consumption-driven organizations. On the other hand, American Express generally caters to a wealthier clientele. Therefore, standard rules might not apply.One thing’s for certain: the former House Speaker remains bullish on AXP based on the latest transaction data. Official records show that Pelosi exercised 50 call options on AXP at a strike price of $80. The transaction occurred on Jan. 21, 2022. While AXP may be down about 12% in the trailing year, the $80 strike price means that Pelosi remains deeply profitable. It’s also encouraging that she hasn’t sold off shares yet.To be fair, though, analyst sentiment dimmed on AXP. At the moment, experts rate shares as a consensus hold. Also, the average price target of $162.29 isn’t anything to write home about. Essentially, this implies only 5.4% upside potential.AllianceBernstein (AB)AllianceBernstein (AB) company logo icon on website, Illustrative EditorialSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comRanking among the high-level names of the best Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy, AllianceBernstein (NYSE:AB) represents a global asset management firm. Specifically, the company caters to institutional, high-net-worth, and retail investors. More than likely, AllianceBernstein favors the former two categories, which makes AB stock an intriguing idea.Basically, your high-net-worth investor and your regular run-of-the-mill type differ largely on access to information. Members of the former category receive financial guidance from the very best analysts and institutions. However, folks in the latter category may get their info from internet luminaries. I’m not saying there’s anything wrong with that. However, serious asset managers will know how to direct portfolios in good times and bad.Therefore, if AllianceBernstein can successfully guide its clients to decent profitability during this environment, there’s no telling what rewards may lie in the future. Stated differently, anybody can pick stocks in a decisive bull market. It’s the real experts that can deliver the goods during a bear market. Lastly, Pelosi remains bullish on AB, purchasing 10,000 shares on Jan. 27 of last year. Still, analysts rate shares a consensus hold. In addition, AB features an average price target which implies a loss of 3.6%.Tesla (TSLA)Interior of the Tesla Model 3Source: Khairil Azhar Junos/Shutterstock.comAgainst a longer-term framework, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) represents one of the most profitable names among the best Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy. While I wouldn’t say it pioneered electric vehicles, it certainly made the concept of an EV-only enterprise a feasible one. As well, the company plays an important role in addressing mobility needs while also meeting environmental objectives.Unfortunately, even mighty Tesla succumbed to the downfall of 2022. In the trailing year, TSLA lost almost 67% of its equity value. Nevertheless, the former House Speaker toes the line. On March 17 of last year, she exercised 25 call options with a strike price of $500. Now, keep in mind that Tesla approved a 3-for-1 stock split on Aug. 4, 2022. Moving forward, Tesla is a bit of a wild card. Although we must move away from hydrocarbon dependency, EVs remain incredibly expensive for the average household. Still, analysts dig their chances with TSLA stock, pegging shares as a consensus moderate buy. Also, they feature an average price target of $251.48, implying 104% upside potential.CrowdStrike (CRWD)Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comWith last year’s volatility, the former House Speaker performed some necessary spring cleaning in her portfolio in 2022. However, based on her still-bullish stance, CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) represents one of the best Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy. As a cybersecurity technology firm, CrowdStrike enjoys significant relevance. After all, cyber breaches and other forms of comprised data have only increased over the years.Working in the top levels of government, Pelosi likely understands the grave statistics. Recently, a report indicated that cyberattack costs for U.S. businesses increased by a startling 80%. On Sept. 3, 2020, Pelosi purchased 5,000 shares of CRWD. Admittedly, though, CRWD represents a name to watch closely and carefully. In the trailing year, CrowdStrike shares dropped over 48%. So, it wouldn’t be surprising if Pelosi exited the investment.That said, Wall Street analysts love CRWD stock, rating it a consensus strong buy. In addition, their average price target of $171.77 implies an upside potential of 77%. Therefore, it might be worth holding onto for just a little bit longer.Roblox (RBLX)An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.Source: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.comPerhaps the most peculiar name among the best Nancy Pelosi stocks to buy, Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) wouldn’t be the first idea I’d associate with the public servant. Part of the reason has to do with the underlying business. As a video game development platform, I can’t imagine that members of Congress care too much about this industry.The other reason it’s difficult to peg Pelosi as an RBLX shareholder is the volatility. In the trailing year, RBLX dropped 63% in equity value. Since making its first public debut, data from Google Finance reveals that it’s under parity by nearly 53%. Nevertheless, Pelosi took a shot on Dec. 20, 2021, purchasing 100 call options with a strike price of $100. They expire on Jan. 20, 2023 – just a few days from now.Generally speaking, it’s difficult to have high hopes for RBLX stock. But that’s now what the analysts believe, who peg Roblox as a consensus moderate buy. Moreover, sentiment among hedge funds rate as very positive, providing some optimism for speculators.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

102,4f54cc44-dbfe-3139-9a2d-d8a12d665740,TSCO,2023-01-16,The 7 Best Stocks to Buy for January 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-best-stocks-buy-january-123127031.html,1673613087.0,STORY,"['XPO', 'HCA', 'TSCO', 'EL', 'NUE', 'SPGI']","[The task of looking for the best stocks to buy for January 2023 is akin to finding a needle in a haystack. There are so many possibilities; it’s hard to pick just seven.The S&amp;P 500 is coming off one of its worst years in history. In 2022, the index’s total return was -18.11%. Only on six occasions since 1926 did the index do worse than this past year.In December, the index lost 5.90%, excluding dividends, putting an exclamation point on a rotten year. Compared to some of the other monthly losses, its nearly 6% decline was middle-of-the-road alarming.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInterestingly, heading into December, the S&amp;P 500 had delivered two consecutive months of healthy gains. It was up 7.99% in October and 5.38% in November. However, a third successive monthly gain was just too much to ask from the stock market gods.  The seven best stocks to buy in January are companies whose businesses are performing reasonably well and whose stocks are on a roll. These companies posted a total return of at least 10% over the past three months through Jan. 10, are are likely to keep the momentum going into February and beyond. BBWIBath &amp; Body Works$46.14NUENucor$155.71HCAHCA Healthcare$255.15ELEstee Lauder$262.25SPGIS&amp;P Global$367.77XPOXPO Logistics$37.76TSCOTractor Supply$220.74Bath &amp; Body Works (BBWI)A Bath &amp; Bodyworks storefrontSource: ShutterstockBath &amp; Body Works (NYSE:BBWI) has a three-month total return of 35.1%. Its three-year total return is 46.7%. On Nov. 16, the company raised its guidance for the 2022 fiscal year. Previously, its earnings estimate was $2.85 per share at the midpoint of its guidance. It now expects EPS of $3.10 at the midpoint. “We are continuing to stay close to our customer, and we remain disciplined in our expense and inventory management,” its Q3 2022 press release stated. “Long-term, we are confident in the fundamentals and potential of our business, and we are excited for Bath &amp; Body Works’ next growth chapter as we officially welcome global personal care and beauty industry veteran, Gina Boswell, as the company’s next Chief Executive Officer in December.”Story continuesBBWI stock jumped on the positive third-quarter results and guidance. Earlier in November, the company announced its new Chief Executive Officer. Gina Boswell is an executive with more than 30 years of experience, including eight at Unilever (NYSE:UL). Between consumers cutting back on spending and shifting toward more experiential products and services, Bath &amp; Body Works braces for lower demand. However, it’s important to remember that it’s facing 2021 comparables that were record-breaking due to Covid-19. As a result, a return to more normal buying patterns was expected. Trading at 1.4-times sales, BBWI stock is still reasonably-priced, despite its gains in the past three months. I wouldn’t be surprised if the momentum continued well into 2023.Nucor (NUE)Steel stocks: rods, bars and other forms of steelSource: ShutterstockNucor (NYSE:NUE) has a three-month total return of 28.5%. Its three-year total return is 43.7%. I’ve admired the North Carolina steel producer for some time. In March 2022, I recommended it, along with nine other S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. I also recommended NUE stock in September 2021. I thought it was among the best stocks that were down, but not out. In mid-September, the company’s shares tumbled after it announced that its Q3 2022 earnings would be significantly below Wall Street estimates and lower than those from the second quarter. Within a couple of weeks, its shares had fallen to $100. When Nucor reported its Q3 2022 results on Oct. 20, they were better than the company’s September guidance, to $6.50 a share, 10 cents above the high end of its range. “Nucor has already achieved a record-breaking year for earnings per share through the first nine months of 2022 and we continue to believe that we will set a new record for full-year earnings in 2022,” stated its Oct. 20 press release.In recent weeks, analysts have been warming to the innovative steel producer. On Jan. 4, Bank of America reinstated coverage of NUE stock with a buy rating and a $172 price target.  There is no question that the company’s results will moderate from the past year’s record results. Nucor’s return on invested capital is more than double its five-year average of 18.57%.  In my opinion, despite the company likely reverting to the mean over the next 6-12 months, Nucor remains an excellent long-term buy.  HCA Healthcare (HCA)two doctors look over a piece of paper while standing in a hallwaySource: ShutterstockHCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) has a three month total return of 26.1%. Its three-year total return is 19.8%.The 25 analysts that cover the hospital operator give it an average overweight rating with a target price of $255.45. Its return on invested capital is 16.31%, while its earnings yield is 7.09%,. That’s reasonable, if not historically low, for one of the best stocks in this space right now. On Jan. 3, HCA finalized its deal to sell three New Orleans-area hospitals to LCMC Health for $150 million, after obtaining approval from the Louisiana Department of Justice to do the transaction. Nurses represented by National Nurses United opposed the sale, as it would leave New Orleans with a duopoly between LCMC and Ochsner Health System. For the country’s largest hospital owner, the sale of the three hospitals is part of its recycling of assets. In 2021, the company sold 50 home health locations and five hospitals for $1.62 billion. It has one hospital left in Louisiana. That will likely be sold soon enough.HCA finished the third quarter with 182 hospitals, down from 183 a year ago. It also had 125 freestanding outpatient surgery centers, up from 123 in Q2 2022. Nevertheless, it’s a revenue-generating machine with $44.74 billion year-to-date through Q3 2022, 2.4% higher than a year ago.Despite higher costs, the company still made $2.90 billion in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) profits in the quarter, an EBITDA margin of nearly 20%. HCA has a 27.2% market share in some of America’s biggest growth markets. This makes it an excellent long-term play.Estee Lauder (EL)An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comEstee Lauder (NYSE:EL) has a three month total return of 21.3%. Its three-year total return is 8.3%. Estee Lauder remains one of the best long-term holds in the consumer discretionary sector. I’ve liked it for years. I first recommended the stock to InvestorPlace readers in November 2012. Every time the stock approached $50 on the downside, investors should be buying.From my November 2012 article to the stock’s all-time high of $374.20 hit in January 2022, EL stock gained 545%. So despite losing nearly 23% over the past year, it’s still gained a bunch for shareholders over the past decade.In September, Goldman Sachs analyst Jason English upgraded Estee Lauder to a Buy from Neutral with a $303 price target. “[Estee Lauder] is arguably emerging from Covid as a stronger business than when it entered the pandemic,” Barron’s reported the analyst’s comments.I couldn’t agree more. On Jan. 10, several media outlets reported that fashion designer Tom Ford bought a $51 million mansion in Palm Beach. But, of course, it’s easy to do that when you sell your brand to Estee Lauder for $2.8 billion. Estee Lauder beat out Kering (OTCMKTS:PPRUY), the owner of several luxury brands, including Gucci, Balenciaga, and Yves Saint Laurent, to buy the Ford brand in November. Estee Lauder struck preemptively to ensure it retained the Tom Ford Beauty brand license. It is the company’s largest acquisition in its history, and remains one of the best stocks to buy in the consumer discretionary space.S&amp;P Global (SPGI)Screenshot through a magnifying glass of the official website of the company S&amp;P Global (SPGI)Source: AntonSAN / Shutterstock.comS&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI) has a three month total return of 18.9%. Its three-year total return is 8.0%. The financial services company consistently makes my lists of the best stocks to buy. Most recently, I included it as one of three stocks with high growth and margins. However, you wouldn’t think that, looking at its operating margins for the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 30. They were in the mid-40% range, due to significantly lower revenues from its S&amp;P Global Ratings segment in 2022.Long-term investors shouldn’t be worried by the company’s near-term slowdown. Instead, it’s a function of the current state of the markets. Once another bull market takes hold, the unit’s revenues will head significantly higher. The 22 analysts that cover S&amp;P Global give it an average buy rating with a target price of $395.65. Its return on invested capital is 13.34%, considerably below its five-year average of 42.74%, while its earnings yield is 3.34%, in line with its five-year average. On Dec. 1, the company presented its medium-term financial targets at its 2022 Investor Day. It expects to grow organic revenues by 7-9% annually over the next four years with adjusted operating margins of 48-50%. “We have full confidence in our ability to achieve these ambitious medium-term targets, which reflect the resilience of our financial model, the ability to accelerate growth and innovation by continued investments, and our focus to deliver unparalleled value for our customers,” said S&amp;P Global Chief Financial Officer Ewout Steenbergen. Analysts see EPS in 2022 of $11.12 and $12.59 in 2023. Accordingly, this stock is trading action 28.1-times its 2023 earnings. XPO Logistics (XPO)Self-driving truck stocks: a self-driving truck on the roadSource: Mike Mareen / ShutterstockXPO Logistics (NYSE:XPO) has a three month total return of 14.3%. Its three-year total return is 12.6%. XPO CEO Brad Jacobs is a legend in the trucking industry. He’s also got a good sense of humor. Jacobs appeared in a Yahoo Finance interview in October, where he talked about his company’s spinoff of RXO (NYSE:RXO), its automated freight brokerage business, and his next big challenge. Bloomberg had this to say about the billionaire:“The billionaire chief executive officer of XPO Logistics Inc. is hunting for a new industry in which to invest after spending just more than a decade building  a company that jumped in market value to about $10 billion from about $160 million. He’s now splitting XPO into three parts and, for the most part, exiting the business,” Bloomberg contributor Thomas Black wrote on Oct. 17. At the same time Jacobs looks for his next adventure, he’ll remain Chairman of XPO, GXO Logistics (NYSE:GXO), which it spun off in 2021, and RXO, which will get spun off in the next month.Most everything Jacobs touches turns to gold. Indeed, XPO has a lot to do with him getting this reputation, and is the key reason this is one of the best stocks in this space. I expect it to continue to perform over the long haul.The 23 analysts that cover XPO give it an average buy rating with a target price of $43.95. Its return on invested capital is 18.2%, while its earnings yield is 20.56%, easily its highest in the past decade. Tractor Supply (TSCO)A Tractor Supply Co. StoreSource: ShutterstockTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) has a three month total return of 13.8%. Its three-year total return is 35.9%.The specialty retailer reported Q3 2022 results in October. Despite missing analyst estimates of $3.29 billion in revenue for the quarter by $20 million, this company remains one of the best stocks in retail. Additionally, on the bottom line, its earnings per share were $2.10, three cents higher than the consensus. “Tractor Supply delivered another record quarter as we continued to gain market share and extended our trend of consistent and stable net sales and earnings growth,” stated CEO Hal Lawton in its Q3 2022 press release.The 33 analysts that cover Tractor Supply give it an average overweight rating with a target price of $232.34. Its return on invested capital for the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 24, 2022, was 17.80%, while its earnings yield is 4.23%, in line with its five-year average. Around the same time Tractor Supply reported its Q3 2022 results, it completed its $320 million acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home. Tractor Supply is taking 81 of the family-owned specialty retailer’s locations. The other 85 have been sold to two buyers for $72 million. In addition, it is selling Orsheln’s corporate headquarters and distribution center to one of the buyers of the discarded stores for $10 million. Tractor Supply will ultimately pay $238 million or $2.94 million per store.TSCO continues to be one of the best growth stories in retail.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Illinois Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Illinois would be the 21st largest economy in the world. It is the fifth largest state in the U.S. with a GDP of around $950 billion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The state is also considered to have one of the most diversified economies in the entire world which is reflected in the 25 biggest Illinois companies and stocks. Even though our list doesn't have a lot of financial companies, Illinois is a major financial center in the U.S. Its economy is majorly centered in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, which is one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the country and is home to many major companies which you're likely familiar with.25 biggest Illinois companies and stocksHenryk Sadura/Shutterstock.comIllinois is known for its manufacturing and service sectors, but it also has a significant agriculture industry that produces a majority of the state's crops, particularly in rural areas outside of the Chicago metropolitan area. Meanwhile, manufacturing accounts for around 15% of Illinois' total output and is among the leading Midwest states in renewable energy, which signifies potential for investment in the state.One of the biggest concerns right now for Illinois is its unemployment rate, which at 4.7%, is currently the second-highest in the U.S. after Nevada. This is mainly because of the state's sluggish recovery from the pandemic as opposed to most other states that are almost at pre-pandemic levels. The economic outlook for Illinois is uncertain in 2022 due to rising inflation and interest rates, and the possibility of a recession in 2023. This makes the immediate future for the state less optimistic. Because of the state's position right now where it still hasn't completely recovered from the pandemic, if a recession is to hit (and it is almost a certainty that it will), then it will be one of the worst affected states in the country.Story continuesLike most states, Illinois provides several benefits and incentives to entice businesses to establish themselves in Illinois, either through incorporation or through relocation. The MICRO Act provides incentives to companies which are engaged in the semiconductor and microchip company while the Reimagining Electric Vehicles Program provides several incentives for businesses which are engaged in the manufacturing of electric vehicles and EV component parts. Meanwhile, the Illinois Angel Investment Tax Credit Program allows for investment in innovative companies at their early stages and help them obtain working capital.The 25 biggest Illinois companies and stocks are some of the most famous in the U.S. with a combined revenue of $940 billion and a combined market cap of $1.6 trillion.

104,bfc76b38-63ef-3a98-9116-e2d40753f9c0,OXY,2023-01-16,Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 58% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/occidental-petroleum-corporation-nyse-oxy-120037839.html,1673870437,STORY,['OXY'],"[If you want to know who really controls Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 58% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Occidental Petroleum, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Occidental Petroleum?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Occidental Petroleum. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Occidental Petroleum's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Occidental Petroleum. Our data shows that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is the largest shareholder with 21% of shares outstanding. Dodge &amp; Cox is the second largest shareholder owning 10% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 6.8% of the company stock.Story continuesWe did some more digging and found that 6 of the top shareholders account for roughly 53% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Occidental PetroleumWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Occidental Petroleum Corporation in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$106m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 20% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Occidental Petroleum. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 21% of the Occidental Petroleum shares on issue. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum (1 can't be ignored!) that you should be aware of before investing here.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

That makes finding the best large-cap stocks a worthy exercise.Of course, in this market, it can be a challenge to identify the best large-cap stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDespite its recent rally, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is still down nearly 6% in the last 12 months and other major indices are down more than that. So, you just can’t throw darts at a board to find your winners.For this list, I use my Portfolio Grader exclusive tool to find the best large-cap stocks to buy.The Portfolio Grader assigns stocks a letter grade based on fundamentals such as sales growth and operating margin. It factors in buying pressure and other quantitative factors that help predict a stock’s future performance.Here are seven large-cap stocks to buy and hold that get strong ratings from the Portfolio Grader.ETEnergy Transfer$12.67LNGCheniere Energy$153.90OXYOccidental Petroleum$65.69SQMSociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile$85.33ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$87.25AFLAflac$72.14APAAPA Corporation$45.44Energy Transfer (ET)An image of a hand holding a light bulb wrapped in leaves, surrounded by green energy source iconsSource: maeching chaiwongwatthana/ShutterstockEnergy stocks had a great 2022 and look destined for a solid 2023. Oil prices remain elevated, and Russia’s war in Ukraine is keeping pressure on the European market.Energy Transfer (NYSE:ET) operates about 120,000 miles of pipelines in North America, transporting about 30% of crude oil and gas in the United States across 41 states.ET stock is up 37% over the last year, including a 10% gain in the last month that corresponded with the easing of oil prices. Even when the price of oil is dropping, Energy Transfer stock is doing well which is why it’s among the best large-cap stocks to buy right now.But even as Energy Transfer easily topped analysts’ expectations of 26 cents earnings per share by recording 35 cents EPS, the company’s revenue numbers fell short. Analysts had expected $24.04 billion in revenue, more than 5% higher that ET posted.Story continuesIs that a sign of trouble for Energy Transfer? I don’t think so. The stock still has an incredibly cheap valuation of 6.8 times forward earnings, and it provides a dividend yield of more than 8%.ET stock may not give you the crazy returns of 2022, but it’s still worth a spot in your portfolio. It currently has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Cheniere Energy (LNG)Aerial drone photo of LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) tanker anchored in small LNG industrial islet of Revithoussa equipped with tanks for storage, Salamina, Greece.Source: Aerial-motion / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for a smaller energy company, Cheniere Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:LNG) may be the stock for you.As European customers are looking for stable supplies after they were cut off from Russian oil and gas, Cheniere is in an enviable position.It shipped 70% of its production to European customers in the first three quarters of 2022 and expected that to continue through the winter.The company posted revenue in the third quarter of $8.8 billion, which was a 175% increase from a year ago. LNG stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) rode the energy stock wave to greater heights in 2022, rising 130% on the year. But what’s really interesting about Occidental is its ambitious plans to combat greenhouse gas emissions and global warming.Occidental is investing in carbon capture technology that would allow it to remove as much as 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere a year.If it is successful in its goal, such a service would be in high demand from nation-states and companies that will be eager to slow or even reverse global warming.OXY stock also is pretty cheap, with a price-earnings ratio of only 8.5. Analysts give it a consensus price target of more than $76, which would indicate a potential 19% upside.OXY stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM)a pile of lithiumSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.comMoving down to South America, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) is an interesting materials stock that is best known for its mining of lithium – the raw material critical in powering electric vehicles, mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras and other things that need a battery.Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile happens to be the largest producer of lithium in the world. The demand for lithium is expected to increase from 500,000 metric tons in 2021 to 1.5 million in 2025, and then to 3 million metric tons by 2030.Surprisingly, SQM seems to be flying under the radar. Despite gains of 74% in the last year, SQM stock has a price-earnings ratio of only 4.5. Analysts give it more than 30% additional upside in the next year.SQM stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) logo on sign at office campusSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comArcher-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) has been able to profit from the rising cost of food attributed to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The stock is up 23% in the last year, and that’s even after a pretty sharp pullback in the last month.Investors may be overly considered that ADM stock would be hurt by a recession in the U.S., but I think those fears are overblown.Commodities companies like ADM would be a safer haven than a company that produces goods that aren’t considered necessary – and food is about as necessary of a product as you can find.Earnings in the third quarter included revenue of $24.68 billion and EPS of $1.86, beating top- and bottom-line estimates of $22.22 in revenue and EPS of $1.41. ADM stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Aflac (AFL)the Aflac (AFL) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAflac (NYSE:AFL) is not a traditional insurer. But thanks to its memorable marketing campaigns that feature a duck quacking out the Aflac name, Aflac may be one of the best-known insurers on the market.If you think that people will try to stretch their dollars and skimp on insurance while trying to cover their bases with Aflac, then AFL stock may be a solid bet.But be warned – the insurance space can be somewhat volatile. AFL stock brought in $4.82 billion in revenue in the third quarter, but that was actually a drop of nearly 8% over the last year. And while the company beat expectations on revenue its EPS of $1.15 missed estimates of $1.22.AFL stock does provide a solid dividend yield of 2.3% and I think it makes a good long-term bet. It has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.APA Corporation (APA)Momentum stocks: Natural gas pipeline through green field with blue sky aboveSource: ShutterstockIf you’re not familiar with APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA), don’t feel bad. APA isn’t a household name because it’s actually a holding company for Apache Energy, which is in the hydrocarbon exploration business. Apache moved to the APA structure in 2021.As Apache, the company operates in the U.S., as well as Egypt and the North Sea. APA also has subsidiaries in Suriname and the Dominican Republic.While the company enjoyed a lot of success in early 2022 from Russia’s war with Ukraine, the stock’s growth slowed substantially over the last six months as U.S. natural gas production increased and Europe had warmer-than-usual weather.However, if China regains its footing this year, as expected, then APA should see demand for natural gas to rise as well. And that should be a strong catalyst for APA stock.In the third quarter, APA recorded revenue of $2.87 billion and earnings per share of $1.97, both better than expectations of $2.32 billion in revenue and EPS of $1.74. APA stock also pays a dividend yield of 2.4%.APA has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in ET, LNG, OXY, SQM and ADM.

Recent inflation-driven events have led us to a precarious place in the markets. Accordingly, with a potential recession on the horizon, few investors may be on the search for high-growth stocks. That makes sense. But, generally speaking, the time to buy beaten-down names is when they’re cheap.Of course, high-growth stocks in areas such as technology may continue to see declines in the year to come. As valuation compression takes hold and investors diversify into other areas of the economy, singularly-focused growth investors may continue to be hit.That said, I think there are pockets of the stock market worth exploring, such as energy and real estate, which most investors would not equate to growth areas, that provide some hefty bargains. Not only that, these companies tend to deliver significant bottom-line growth. And in this economy, profits matter more than anything else.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHere are three high-growth stocks I think are worth buying right now.OXYOccidental Petroleum$65.71THTarget Hospitality$18.06MROMarathon Oil$27.58Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) may not be included in a list of high-growth stocks for many investors, but it nevertheless deserves a look.Shares of this leading oil and gas player have performed pretty well so far this year, up more than 4%. This follows a 119% advance in 2022.A prominent Warren Buffett holding, Occidental has seen continued interest, even as energy prices have come down from their highs. It’s easy to see why Buffett is on the Occidental train. The company’s earnings growth has been impressive.Occidental is expected to report fourth-quarter and full-year results on Feb. 23. Analysts are predicting Q4 EPS of $1.97 and 2022 EPS of $9.83. If Occidental meets those targets, it will deliver year-over-year growth of 33% and 285%, respectively.Story continuesAccordingly, this is a stock I think deserves to be put in the high-growth bucket by long-term investors.Target Hospitality (TH)an empty, sunlit hotel roomSource: ShutterstockThe previously announced exchange offer for all of Target Hospitality’s (NASDAQ:TH) outstanding warrants has closed. For this leader in providing vertically integrated modular lodging and hospitality services, that’s a big positive investors are starting to price into the stock. Shares are up 19% since the start of the year.A total of 8,097,893 exercisable warrants (which includes 369,471 warrants tendered through assured delivery), representing approximately 50.1% of the warrants, were correctly tendered and not withdrawn in the offer. Target exchanged these warrants for 2,996,201 shares of common stock in accordance with the terms of the offer. That leaves 8,068,656 warrants still outstanding after the offer has closed.For the third quarter, Target Hospitality posted record quarterly revenue of $159.6 million, an increase of 79% from the corresponding period in 2021. For the same period, net income of $19 million surged 184% from a year ago.Currently, Target Hospitality stock is trading around the $18 level with the potential to go much higher this year.Marathon Oil (MRO)Marathon Oil Logo at the top of a mobile device.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comMarathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) is another top energy name making this list of high-growth stocks to buy. Like Occidental, the company’s bottom-line growth prospects are what makes it worth buying. So far this year, shares are up around 2% after gaining 67% in 2022.I think the company’s upcoming earnings report, scheduled for Feb. 15, may exceed investor expectations. Marathon is expected to earn 96 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2022, up 25% year over year. However, if it is able to produce similar bottom-line results to Occidental, this is a name that could get more love. Meanwhile, while Q4 revenue is expected to increase less than 2% compared with a year ago, full-year revenue is projected to surge nearly 46%.In addition, Marathon Oil recently disclosed that, after accounting for closing adjustments, it had successfully completed the acquisition of Ensign Natural Resources’ Eagle Ford assets for a total cash consideration of $3 billion. This is a key driver of bottom-line growth I think the market has yet to price in.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

Plastic is widely used in many industries because it is lightweight, durable, and cost-efficient. Plastic manufacturing typically involves the use of injection molding, extrusion, and blow molding processes, among others. Injection molding involves forcing molten plastic into a mold to create a desired shape. Extrusion involves forcing plastic through a die to create a continuous shape. Blow molding involves blowing air into a plastic container or bottle to create a desired shape. The industry also uses a variety of secondary processes, such as painting, machining, and assembly. Companies may also offer custom services, such as designing and creating molds and dies for specific products.The Global Plastic Industry: An AnalysisAccording to a market research report by Grand View Research, the global plastic industry was worth $593 billion in 2021. The industry is projected to grow to $811.57 billion by 2030 at a compound annual growth rate of 3.7%, from 2022 to 2030.Favorable demand trends for plastic products from lucrative end-markets such as consumer electronics, construction, and automotive are expected to drive this growth.

So far, in 2023, ARKF is up 7.6%, 140 basis points higher than FINX and 420 basis points better than the index. If this is any indication of how the year may go for the sector, 2023 could be the year fintech stocks come alive.     The Global X Fintech ETF provides exposure to 71 fintech stocks, thereby avoiding too much company-specific risk. The ARK Fintech Innovation ETF typically owns between 35 and 55 stocks at any given time. As of Jan. 12, it held 30.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIf you don’t want the task of following all of the fintech stocks currently trading on U.S. stock exchanges, both of the ETFs mentioned above are good alternatives. However, for those who want to bet on individual fintech stocks, the funds’ top holdings are a good place to start.All three of my choices for the best fintech stocks to buy now got hammered in 2022. That makes all three excellent buys if you’re willing to hold for the long term.     SQBlock$70.06INTUIntuit$396.44TOSTToast$19.20Block (SQ)Block logo over a background with former square logo. SQ stock.Source: Sergei Elagin / ShutterstockBlock (NYSE:SQ) is the largest holding of FINX with a 7.4% weighting, as well as the largest holding of ARKF at 11.5%.Baird analyst David Koning recently upgraded the parent of Square, Cash App and Afterpay to “outperform” from “neutral.” The analyst kept his neutral rating on Block for two years before upgrading its stock on Jan. 3. Koning increased his price target by $16 to $78, which is 11% higher than where it’s currently trading. Koning believes the company’s hefty cash balance of $4.6 billion, as of Sept. 30, should contribute an additional $160 million (20 cents a share) of pretax income in 2023, assuming a 2% increase in interest rates this year.  Story continuesHighlights from Block’s third-quarter report included year-over-year increases of 17% in revenue to $4.52 billion, 51% in Cash App gross profits to $774 million and 29% in Square gross profits to $783 million. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $327 million were 40% higher than in Q3 2021. “After a wild ride over the past 2.5 years, Block’s business is emerging from the pandemic stronger than ever,” Lisa Ellis, senior managing director at MoffettNathanson wrote in a Nov. 4 note to clients, Barron’s reported.With shares trading at just 2.3 times sales, well below their five-year average of 8, Block is the best of the best fintech stocks to buy.Intuit (INTU)Intuit and turbotax logo on a phone screen on top of a keyboard. INTU stock.Source: Julio Ricco / ShutterstockIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is the fourth-largest holding of FINX with a 6.5% weighting, while it is the 19th-largest holding of ARKF at 1.6%. Its stock is up around 2% in 2023. The company is best known for TurboTax, QuickBooks, Credit Karma and Mailchimp. Intuit paid $7.1 billion in February 2020 for Credit Karma, best known for providing free credit scores. In September 2021, it paid $12 billion in cash and stock for Mailchimp, which has helped accelerate Intuit’s growth with small and mid-sized businesses.  In the company’s most recent quarter, Credit Karma grew revenue by 2% to $425 million. Overall, the company’s revenue jumped 29% to $2.6 billion, with a 13-percentage-point contribution from Mailchimp. For all of fiscal 2023, Intuit expects revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $14.035 billion to $14.25 billion and $13.59 to $13.89, respectively. While the top-line estimate is down from previous guidance, management is still forecasting 11% revenue growth and 16% earnings growth at the midpoint of their guidance.It’s hard not to appreciate how much Intuit has grown. In July 2010, Intuit had 29 million customers. At the end of July 2022, it had 103 million.The only fly in the ointment for Intuit is its Credit Karma business. Management has gone from projecting double-digit growth in revenue in fiscal 2023 to a double-digit contraction. Of the 28 analysts covering the stock, 23 rate it “overweight” or “buy,” with an average target price of $473. That’s 19% higher than where it’s currently trading. Toast (TOST)A close-up of a Toast (TOST) ordering screen.Source: TonelsonProductions / Shutterstock.comToast (NYSE:TOST) is the 19th-largest holding of FINX with a 1.7% weighting, and it is the 11th-largest holding of ARKF at 3.9%. Its stock is up 6.5% in 2023 and 33% over the past six months.The provider of an end-to-end software-as-a-service platform for the restaurant industry reported Q3 results in mid-November. They were so good that management upped their guidance for the entire year. On the top line, Toast now expects revenue of at least $2.69 billion, $72 million higher than its previous guidance. While the company expects to post an EBITDA loss of $117 million to $127 million, that is down from a previous range of $140 million to $160 million. Moreover, the company’s losses are trending in the right direction. Benzinga reported comments from Mizuho analyst Dan Dolev on Jan. 9. In a nutshell, Toast is taking market share from Square in the restaurant arena, which accounts for 30% of Block’s gross payment volume.Analysts are getting more optimistic about its future. Of the 20 analysts covering TOST, 12 either rate it “overweight” or “buy.” Their average target price of $24.53 is 28% higher than where it’s currently trading. In mid-November, Needham analyst Mayank Tandon had some very positive comments to clients about Toast, according to Barron’s. “We believe TOST provides critical solutions to restaurants that can help manage costs and drive incremental sales which we believe becomes vital during times of economic strain,” Tandon wrote in a note to clients. TOST has the greatest risk of today’s three best fintech stocks but could also have the greatest reward.

It is also among the biggest states in the U.S. in terms of manufacturing, home to more than 12,000 manufacturers.Recognizing its allure for business headquarters, Ohio has taken significant actions to ensure that it continues to be an attractive proposition for companies. The state also offers performance-based incentives which are in place to assist companies that are either starting, relocating or expanding operations in Ohio. Some of these incentives include the job creation tax credit, which is a tax credit based on performance which is calculated as a percentage of the company's total payroll and credit is set against its commercial tax liability. Another such tax break is the DataCenter tax abatement, which allows a company to take advantage of either a partial of full sales tax exemption if you purchase eligible data center equipment. According to PwC, the state has also modified and enacted new tax incentive programs in the 2022 - 2023 budget such as allowing work from home employees to qualify for tax credits while taxpayers that qualify for megaprojects can receive additional tax benefits, which is great news for the 20 biggest Ohio companies and stocks.20 biggest Ohio companies and stocksPixabay / Public DomainIn addition to these tax credits, there are several loan and grant programs that companies can utilize especially for the development of emerging technologies and products and for businesses which are owned by minorities in the state.

We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Valero Energy What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.83bUS$4.85bUS$4.12bUS$3.71bUS$3.47bUS$3.34bUS$3.27bUS$3.24bUS$3.24bUS$3.25bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Est @ -15.09%Est @ -9.97%Est @ -6.38%Est @ -3.87%Est @ -2.12%Est @ -0.89%Est @ -0.03%Est @ 0.57% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.9% US$6.2kUS$4.0kUS$3.1kUS$2.5kUS$2.2kUS$1.9kUS$1.7kUS$1.5kUS$1.4kUS$1.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$26bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.9%– 2.0%) = US$42bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$42b÷ ( 1 + 9.9%)10= US$16bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$42b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$136, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Valero Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.318. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Valero EnergyStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityVLO's financial characteristics indicate limited near-term opportunities for shareholders.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 4 years.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest Illinois Companies and Stocks.If all U.S. states were countries, Illinois would be the 21st largest economy in the world. It is the fifth largest state in the U.S. with a GDP of around $950 billion in 2021, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The state is also considered to have one of the most diversified economies in the entire world which is reflected in the 25 biggest Illinois companies and stocks. Even though our list doesn't have a lot of financial companies, Illinois is a major financial center in the U.S. Its economy is majorly centered in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, which is one of the biggest metropolitan areas in the country and is home to many major companies which you're likely familiar with.25 biggest Illinois companies and stocksHenryk Sadura/Shutterstock.comIllinois is known for its manufacturing and service sectors, but it also has a significant agriculture industry that produces a majority of the state's crops, particularly in rural areas outside of the Chicago metropolitan area. Meanwhile, manufacturing accounts for around 15% of Illinois' total output and is among the leading Midwest states in renewable energy, which signifies potential for investment in the state.One of the biggest concerns right now for Illinois is its unemployment rate, which at 4.7%, is currently the second-highest in the U.S. after Nevada. This is mainly because of the state's sluggish recovery from the pandemic as opposed to most other states that are almost at pre-pandemic levels. The economic outlook for Illinois is uncertain in 2022 due to rising inflation and interest rates, and the possibility of a recession in 2023. This makes the immediate future for the state less optimistic. Because of the state's position right now where it still hasn't completely recovered from the pandemic, if a recession is to hit (and it is almost a certainty that it will), then it will be one of the worst affected states in the country.Story continuesLike most states, Illinois provides several benefits and incentives to entice businesses to establish themselves in Illinois, either through incorporation or through relocation. The MICRO Act provides incentives to companies which are engaged in the semiconductor and microchip company while the Reimagining Electric Vehicles Program provides several incentives for businesses which are engaged in the manufacturing of electric vehicles and EV component parts. Meanwhile, the Illinois Angel Investment Tax Credit Program allows for investment in innovative companies at their early stages and help them obtain working capital.The 25 biggest Illinois companies and stocks are some of the most famous in the U.S. with a combined revenue of $940 billion and a combined market cap of $1.6 trillion.

There are so many possibilities; it’s hard to pick just seven.The S&amp;P 500 is coming off one of its worst years in history. In 2022, the index’s total return was -18.11%. Only on six occasions since 1926 did the index do worse than this past year.In December, the index lost 5.90%, excluding dividends, putting an exclamation point on a rotten year. Compared to some of the other monthly losses, its nearly 6% decline was middle-of-the-road alarming.  InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInterestingly, heading into December, the S&amp;P 500 had delivered two consecutive months of healthy gains. It was up 7.99% in October and 5.38% in November. However, a third successive monthly gain was just too much to ask from the stock market gods.  The seven best stocks to buy in January are companies whose businesses are performing reasonably well and whose stocks are on a roll. These companies posted a total return of at least 10% over the past three months through Jan. 10, are are likely to keep the momentum going into February and beyond. BBWIBath &amp; Body Works$46.14NUENucor$155.71HCAHCA Healthcare$255.15ELEstee Lauder$262.25SPGIS&amp;P Global$367.77XPOXPO Logistics$37.76TSCOTractor Supply$220.74Bath &amp; Body Works (BBWI)A Bath &amp; Bodyworks storefrontSource: ShutterstockBath &amp; Body Works (NYSE:BBWI) has a three-month total return of 35.1%. Its three-year total return is 46.7%. On Nov. 16, the company raised its guidance for the 2022 fiscal year. Previously, its earnings estimate was $2.85 per share at the midpoint of its guidance. It now expects EPS of $3.10 at the midpoint. “We are continuing to stay close to our customer, and we remain disciplined in our expense and inventory management,” its Q3 2022 press release stated. “Long-term, we are confident in the fundamentals and potential of our business, and we are excited for Bath &amp; Body Works’ next growth chapter as we officially welcome global personal care and beauty industry veteran, Gina Boswell, as the company’s next Chief Executive Officer in December.”Story continuesBBWI stock jumped on the positive third-quarter results and guidance. Earlier in November, the company announced its new Chief Executive Officer. Gina Boswell is an executive with more than 30 years of experience, including eight at Unilever (NYSE:UL). Between consumers cutting back on spending and shifting toward more experiential products and services, Bath &amp; Body Works braces for lower demand. However, it’s important to remember that it’s facing 2021 comparables that were record-breaking due to Covid-19. As a result, a return to more normal buying patterns was expected. Trading at 1.4-times sales, BBWI stock is still reasonably-priced, despite its gains in the past three months. I wouldn’t be surprised if the momentum continued well into 2023.Nucor (NUE)Steel stocks: rods, bars and other forms of steelSource: ShutterstockNucor (NYSE:NUE) has a three-month total return of 28.5%. Its three-year total return is 43.7%. I’ve admired the North Carolina steel producer for some time. In March 2022, I recommended it, along with nine other S&amp;P 500 stocks to buy. I also recommended NUE stock in September 2021. I thought it was among the best stocks that were down, but not out. In mid-September, the company’s shares tumbled after it announced that its Q3 2022 earnings would be significantly below Wall Street estimates and lower than those from the second quarter. Within a couple of weeks, its shares had fallen to $100. When Nucor reported its Q3 2022 results on Oct. 20, they were better than the company’s September guidance, to $6.50 a share, 10 cents above the high end of its range. “Nucor has already achieved a record-breaking year for earnings per share through the first nine months of 2022 and we continue to believe that we will set a new record for full-year earnings in 2022,” stated its Oct. 20 press release.In recent weeks, analysts have been warming to the innovative steel producer. On Jan. 4, Bank of America reinstated coverage of NUE stock with a buy rating and a $172 price target.  There is no question that the company’s results will moderate from the past year’s record results. Nucor’s return on invested capital is more than double its five-year average of 18.57%.  In my opinion, despite the company likely reverting to the mean over the next 6-12 months, Nucor remains an excellent long-term buy.  HCA Healthcare (HCA)two doctors look over a piece of paper while standing in a hallwaySource: ShutterstockHCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) has a three month total return of 26.1%. Its three-year total return is 19.8%.The 25 analysts that cover the hospital operator give it an average overweight rating with a target price of $255.45. Its return on invested capital is 16.31%, while its earnings yield is 7.09%,. That’s reasonable, if not historically low, for one of the best stocks in this space right now. On Jan. 3, HCA finalized its deal to sell three New Orleans-area hospitals to LCMC Health for $150 million, after obtaining approval from the Louisiana Department of Justice to do the transaction. Nurses represented by National Nurses United opposed the sale, as it would leave New Orleans with a duopoly between LCMC and Ochsner Health System. For the country’s largest hospital owner, the sale of the three hospitals is part of its recycling of assets. In 2021, the company sold 50 home health locations and five hospitals for $1.62 billion. It has one hospital left in Louisiana. That will likely be sold soon enough.HCA finished the third quarter with 182 hospitals, down from 183 a year ago. It also had 125 freestanding outpatient surgery centers, up from 123 in Q2 2022. Nevertheless, it’s a revenue-generating machine with $44.74 billion year-to-date through Q3 2022, 2.4% higher than a year ago.Despite higher costs, the company still made $2.90 billion in EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) profits in the quarter, an EBITDA margin of nearly 20%. HCA has a 27.2% market share in some of America’s biggest growth markets. This makes it an excellent long-term play.Estee Lauder (EL)An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comEstee Lauder (NYSE:EL) has a three month total return of 21.3%. Its three-year total return is 8.3%. Estee Lauder remains one of the best long-term holds in the consumer discretionary sector. I’ve liked it for years. I first recommended the stock to InvestorPlace readers in November 2012. Every time the stock approached $50 on the downside, investors should be buying.From my November 2012 article to the stock’s all-time high of $374.20 hit in January 2022, EL stock gained 545%. So despite losing nearly 23% over the past year, it’s still gained a bunch for shareholders over the past decade.In September, Goldman Sachs analyst Jason English upgraded Estee Lauder to a Buy from Neutral with a $303 price target. “[Estee Lauder] is arguably emerging from Covid as a stronger business than when it entered the pandemic,” Barron’s reported the analyst’s comments.I couldn’t agree more. On Jan. 10, several media outlets reported that fashion designer Tom Ford bought a $51 million mansion in Palm Beach. But, of course, it’s easy to do that when you sell your brand to Estee Lauder for $2.8 billion. Estee Lauder beat out Kering (OTCMKTS:PPRUY), the owner of several luxury brands, including Gucci, Balenciaga, and Yves Saint Laurent, to buy the Ford brand in November. Estee Lauder struck preemptively to ensure it retained the Tom Ford Beauty brand license. It is the company’s largest acquisition in its history, and remains one of the best stocks to buy in the consumer discretionary space.S&amp;P Global (SPGI)Screenshot through a magnifying glass of the official website of the company S&amp;P Global (SPGI)Source: AntonSAN / Shutterstock.comS&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI) has a three month total return of 18.9%. Its three-year total return is 8.0%. The financial services company consistently makes my lists of the best stocks to buy. Most recently, I included it as one of three stocks with high growth and margins. However, you wouldn’t think that, looking at its operating margins for the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 30. They were in the mid-40% range, due to significantly lower revenues from its S&amp;P Global Ratings segment in 2022.Long-term investors shouldn’t be worried by the company’s near-term slowdown. Instead, it’s a function of the current state of the markets. Once another bull market takes hold, the unit’s revenues will head significantly higher. The 22 analysts that cover S&amp;P Global give it an average buy rating with a target price of $395.65. Its return on invested capital is 13.34%, considerably below its five-year average of 42.74%, while its earnings yield is 3.34%, in line with its five-year average. On Dec. 1, the company presented its medium-term financial targets at its 2022 Investor Day. It expects to grow organic revenues by 7-9% annually over the next four years with adjusted operating margins of 48-50%. “We have full confidence in our ability to achieve these ambitious medium-term targets, which reflect the resilience of our financial model, the ability to accelerate growth and innovation by continued investments, and our focus to deliver unparalleled value for our customers,” said S&amp;P Global Chief Financial Officer Ewout Steenbergen. Analysts see EPS in 2022 of $11.12 and $12.59 in 2023. Accordingly, this stock is trading action 28.1-times its 2023 earnings. XPO Logistics (XPO)Self-driving truck stocks: a self-driving truck on the roadSource: Mike Mareen / ShutterstockXPO Logistics (NYSE:XPO) has a three month total return of 14.3%. Its three-year total return is 12.6%. XPO CEO Brad Jacobs is a legend in the trucking industry. He’s also got a good sense of humor. Jacobs appeared in a Yahoo Finance interview in October, where he talked about his company’s spinoff of RXO (NYSE:RXO), its automated freight brokerage business, and his next big challenge. Bloomberg had this to say about the billionaire:“The billionaire chief executive officer of XPO Logistics Inc. is hunting for a new industry in which to invest after spending just more than a decade building  a company that jumped in market value to about $10 billion from about $160 million. He’s now splitting XPO into three parts and, for the most part, exiting the business,” Bloomberg contributor Thomas Black wrote on Oct. 17. At the same time Jacobs looks for his next adventure, he’ll remain Chairman of XPO, GXO Logistics (NYSE:GXO), which it spun off in 2021, and RXO, which will get spun off in the next month.Most everything Jacobs touches turns to gold. Indeed, XPO has a lot to do with him getting this reputation, and is the key reason this is one of the best stocks in this space. I expect it to continue to perform over the long haul.The 23 analysts that cover XPO give it an average buy rating with a target price of $43.95. Its return on invested capital is 18.2%, while its earnings yield is 20.56%, easily its highest in the past decade. Tractor Supply (TSCO)A Tractor Supply Co. StoreSource: ShutterstockTractor Supply (NASDAQ:TSCO) has a three month total return of 13.8%. Its three-year total return is 35.9%.The specialty retailer reported Q3 2022 results in October. Despite missing analyst estimates of $3.29 billion in revenue for the quarter by $20 million, this company remains one of the best stocks in retail. Additionally, on the bottom line, its earnings per share were $2.10, three cents higher than the consensus. “Tractor Supply delivered another record quarter as we continued to gain market share and extended our trend of consistent and stable net sales and earnings growth,” stated CEO Hal Lawton in its Q3 2022 press release.The 33 analysts that cover Tractor Supply give it an average overweight rating with a target price of $232.34. Its return on invested capital for the trailing 12 months ended Sept. 24, 2022, was 17.80%, while its earnings yield is 4.23%, in line with its five-year average. Around the same time Tractor Supply reported its Q3 2022 results, it completed its $320 million acquisition of Orscheln Farm and Home. Tractor Supply is taking 81 of the family-owned specialty retailer’s locations. The other 85 have been sold to two buyers for $72 million. In addition, it is selling Orsheln’s corporate headquarters and distribution center to one of the buyers of the discarded stores for $10 million. Tractor Supply will ultimately pay $238 million or $2.94 million per store.TSCO continues to be one of the best growth stories in retail.On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Oil prices remain elevated, and Russia’s war in Ukraine is keeping pressure on the European market.Energy Transfer (NYSE:ET) operates about 120,000 miles of pipelines in North America, transporting about 30% of crude oil and gas in the United States across 41 states.ET stock is up 37% over the last year, including a 10% gain in the last month that corresponded with the easing of oil prices. Even when the price of oil is dropping, Energy Transfer stock is doing well which is why it’s among the best large-cap stocks to buy right now.But even as Energy Transfer easily topped analysts’ expectations of 26 cents earnings per share by recording 35 cents EPS, the company’s revenue numbers fell short. Analysts had expected $24.04 billion in revenue, more than 5% higher that ET posted.Story continuesIs that a sign of trouble for Energy Transfer? I don’t think so. The stock still has an incredibly cheap valuation of 6.8 times forward earnings, and it provides a dividend yield of more than 8%.ET stock may not give you the crazy returns of 2022, but it’s still worth a spot in your portfolio. It currently has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Cheniere Energy (LNG)Aerial drone photo of LNG (Liquified Natural Gas) tanker anchored in small LNG industrial islet of Revithoussa equipped with tanks for storage, Salamina, Greece.Source: Aerial-motion / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for a smaller energy company, Cheniere Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:LNG) may be the stock for you.As European customers are looking for stable supplies after they were cut off from Russian oil and gas, Cheniere is in an enviable position.It shipped 70% of its production to European customers in the first three quarters of 2022 and expected that to continue through the winter.The company posted revenue in the third quarter of $8.8 billion, which was a 175% increase from a year ago. LNG stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)Person holding cellphone with logo of American company Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) rode the energy stock wave to greater heights in 2022, rising 130% on the year. But what’s really interesting about Occidental is its ambitious plans to combat greenhouse gas emissions and global warming.Occidental is investing in carbon capture technology that would allow it to remove as much as 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere a year.If it is successful in its goal, such a service would be in high demand from nation-states and companies that will be eager to slow or even reverse global warming.OXY stock also is pretty cheap, with a price-earnings ratio of only 8.5. Analysts give it a consensus price target of more than $76, which would indicate a potential 19% upside.OXY stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (SQM)a pile of lithiumSource: Bjoern Wylezich/ShutterStock.comMoving down to South America, Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile (NYSE:SQM) is an interesting materials stock that is best known for its mining of lithium – the raw material critical in powering electric vehicles, mobile phones, laptops, digital cameras and other things that need a battery.Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile happens to be the largest producer of lithium in the world. The demand for lithium is expected to increase from 500,000 metric tons in 2021 to 1.5 million in 2025, and then to 3 million metric tons by 2030.Surprisingly, SQM seems to be flying under the radar. Despite gains of 74% in the last year, SQM stock has a price-earnings ratio of only 4.5. Analysts give it more than 30% additional upside in the next year.SQM stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) logo on sign at office campusSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comArcher-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) has been able to profit from the rising cost of food attributed to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.The stock is up 23% in the last year, and that’s even after a pretty sharp pullback in the last month.Investors may be overly considered that ADM stock would be hurt by a recession in the U.S., but I think those fears are overblown.Commodities companies like ADM would be a safer haven than a company that produces goods that aren’t considered necessary – and food is about as necessary of a product as you can find.Earnings in the third quarter included revenue of $24.68 billion and EPS of $1.86, beating top- and bottom-line estimates of $22.22 in revenue and EPS of $1.41. ADM stock has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Aflac (AFL)the Aflac (AFL) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAflac (NYSE:AFL) is not a traditional insurer. But thanks to its memorable marketing campaigns that feature a duck quacking out the Aflac name, Aflac may be one of the best-known insurers on the market.If you think that people will try to stretch their dollars and skimp on insurance while trying to cover their bases with Aflac, then AFL stock may be a solid bet.But be warned – the insurance space can be somewhat volatile. AFL stock brought in $4.82 billion in revenue in the third quarter, but that was actually a drop of nearly 8% over the last year. And while the company beat expectations on revenue its EPS of $1.15 missed estimates of $1.22.AFL stock does provide a solid dividend yield of 2.3% and I think it makes a good long-term bet. It has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.APA Corporation (APA)Momentum stocks: Natural gas pipeline through green field with blue sky aboveSource: ShutterstockIf you’re not familiar with APA Corporation (NASDAQ:APA), don’t feel bad. APA isn’t a household name because it’s actually a holding company for Apache Energy, which is in the hydrocarbon exploration business. Apache moved to the APA structure in 2021.As Apache, the company operates in the U.S., as well as Egypt and the North Sea. APA also has subsidiaries in Suriname and the Dominican Republic.While the company enjoyed a lot of success in early 2022 from Russia’s war with Ukraine, the stock’s growth slowed substantially over the last six months as U.S. natural gas production increased and Europe had warmer-than-usual weather.However, if China regains its footing this year, as expected, then APA should see demand for natural gas to rise as well. And that should be a strong catalyst for APA stock.In the third quarter, APA recorded revenue of $2.87 billion and earnings per share of $1.97, both better than expectations of $2.32 billion in revenue and EPS of $1.74. APA stock also pays a dividend yield of 2.4%.APA has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in ET, LNG, OXY, SQM and ADM.

If it was a country, Ohio would be in the top 26 countries in the world ranked by GDP. In 2013, the state was ranked among the top 10 states for best business climate by Site Selection. It is also among the biggest states in the U.S. in terms of manufacturing, home to more than 12,000 manufacturers.Recognizing its allure for business headquarters, Ohio has taken significant actions to ensure that it continues to be an attractive proposition for companies. The state also offers performance-based incentives which are in place to assist companies that are either starting, relocating or expanding operations in Ohio. Some of these incentives include the job creation tax credit, which is a tax credit based on performance which is calculated as a percentage of the company's total payroll and credit is set against its commercial tax liability. Another such tax break is the DataCenter tax abatement, which allows a company to take advantage of either a partial of full sales tax exemption if you purchase eligible data center equipment. According to PwC, the state has also modified and enacted new tax incentive programs in the 2022 - 2023 budget such as allowing work from home employees to qualify for tax credits while taxpayers that qualify for megaprojects can receive additional tax benefits, which is great news for the 20 biggest Ohio companies and stocks.20 biggest Ohio companies and stocksPixabay / Public DomainIn addition to these tax credits, there are several loan and grant programs that companies can utilize especially for the development of emerging technologies and products and for businesses which are owned by minorities in the state.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Biggest California Companies and Stocks.California is not just the most populous state in the U.S. with over 39 million residents, but it is also the largest economy in the U.S., with its 2021 GDP worth over $3.4 trillion. Texas is the next biggest with a GDP of just over $2 billion, which shows how wide the gap between the first and the second biggest state is. Just for some perspective on how truly large the economy of California is, it is the biggest subnational economy in the world. If California was a country, it would be the 4th largest economy in the world, surpassed only by China, Germany and Japan!25 biggest California companies and stocksstellamc/Shutterstock.comCalifornia is home to Silicon Valley which is considered to be the technological hub of the world, with many of the biggest tech companies in the world headquartered there, including some of the biggest California companies and stocks. More than 30 businesses in the Fortune 1000 are headquartered in Silicon Valley not to mention thousands of startup companies which are headquartered in the region to take advantage of the wealth of talent not to mention venture capital. After all, around a third of the total venture capital fund in the U.S. is spent in Silicon Valley.Of course, the tech industry isn't the only industry in the state worth over $3.4 trillion. Finance, manufacturing and business sectors are all important contributors to the economy of California while its agricultural output is the highest of any state in the country. Some of the biggest media companies are also located in the state, which shouldn't be surprising. After all, Los Angeles, home to Hollywood, is also located in California. Overall, unemployment in the state is at 4.1%, an increase of 0.1% from October despite almost 27,000 nonfarm payroll jobs being added. However, the state is in a much better situation compared to November 2021 when the unemployment rate was 5.8%.Story continuesOf course, it isn't all doom and gloom for companies in California as the state does provide several financial incentives for businesses including consulting and low-cost training pertaining to loans and grants, startup business plans, strengthening operations and entering new markets among others. While taxes are comparatively high in the state, companies are also provided tax incentive programs which are presented to encourage innovation, development and growth.California is a Democratic state, and unlike most Republican states, it imposes high taxes on corporations to derive revenue that is used to fund the state's budget. Because of this difference in tax rates, many companies have started to move their headquarters from California, with perhaps the most recent high profile move being Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), which moved its headquarters to Texas from California, something that Elon Musk had been threatening for a while. According to a report from the Hoover Institution, the rate of companies leaving California in 2021 was twice that of 2020 and 2019, and three times that of 2018, which includes 11 Fortune 1,000 companies. With costs being exceptionally high in the state, many other companies might follow suit in a bit to reduce costs.MethodologyTo determine the biggest California companies and stocks, we first found out the 25 top companies by revenue headquartered in California from Fortune 500 and then determined their latest market cap from Yahoo Finance. In what has been a volatile year especially for tech stocks, which are well-represented among the largest companies in California, which is why the top 25 stocks in the state had an average loss of 20% over the previous year.

125,70a83fd6-82cc-3fde-8414-09322a20088f,CSCO,2023-01-16,Here's Why Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Can Manage Its Debt Responsibly,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-cisco-systems-nasdaq-130015967.html,1673787615,STORY,['CSCO'],"[The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We note that Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together. See our latest analysis for Cisco Systems What Is Cisco Systems's Net Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Cisco Systems had debt of US$8.93b at the end of October 2022, a reduction from US$9.50b over a year. But on the other hand it also has US$19.8b in cash, leading to a US$10.9b net cash position.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Cisco Systems' Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Cisco Systems had liabilities of US$24.9b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$27.9b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$19.8b as well as receivables valued at US$9.12b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$23.9b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.Story continuesOf course, Cisco Systems has a titanic market capitalization of US$200.8b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Cisco Systems also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.Cisco Systems's EBIT was pretty flat over the last year, but that shouldn't be an issue given the it doesn't have a lot of debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Cisco Systems's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. While Cisco Systems has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, Cisco Systems actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. There's nothing better than incoming cash when it comes to staying in your lenders' good graces.Summing UpAlthough Cisco Systems's balance sheet isn't particularly strong, due to the total liabilities, it is clearly positive to see that it has net cash of US$10.9b. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$13b, being 102% of its EBIT. So we don't think Cisco Systems's use of debt is risky. Given Cisco Systems has a strong balance sheet is profitable and pays a dividend, it would be good to know how fast its dividends are growing, if at all.
