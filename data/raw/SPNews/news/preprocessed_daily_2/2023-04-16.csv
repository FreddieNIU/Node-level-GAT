1,67fa6e35-9f25-35d1-abcd-daf30de3e5fa,TXN,2023-04-16,Those who invested in Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) five years ago are up 105%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-texas-instruments-nasdaq-130025428.html,1681563625,STORY,['TXN'],"[Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. To wit, the Texas Instruments share price has climbed 79% in five years, easily topping the market return of 47% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 6.0% in the last year , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Texas Instruments managed to grow its earnings per share at 21% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 12% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Texas Instruments has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Texas Instruments' TSR for the last 5 years was 105%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's good to see that Texas Instruments has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 6.0% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 15% a year, is even better. The pessimistic view would be that be that the stock has its best days behind it, but on the other hand the price might simply be moderating while the business itself continues to execute. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance.

2,9ef976a0-abb0-3e3f-9a2f-aae436e92ddf,QRVO,2023-04-16,"Qorvo, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:QRVO) Stock Has Been Sliding But Fundamentals Look Strong: Is The Market Wrong?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qorvo-inc-nasdaq-qrvo-stock-142401246.html,1681568641,STORY,['QRVO'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Qorvo's (NASDAQ:QRVO) recent performance, when its stock has declined 6.8% over the past three months. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study Qorvo's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Qorvo How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Qorvo is:11% = US$454m ÷ US$4.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.11 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.A Side By Side comparison of Qorvo's Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo begin with, Qorvo seems to have a respectable ROE. Be that as it may, the company's ROE is still quite lower than the industry average of 18%. However, we are pleased to see the impressive 46% net income growth reported by Qorvo over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also does lend some color to the high earnings growth seen by the company.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Qorvo's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 27%.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for QRVO? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Qorvo Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Qorvo doesn't pay any dividend to its shareholders, meaning that the company has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This is likely what's driving the high earnings growth number discussed above.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Qorvo's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business at a moderate rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

During the peak of March's bank crisis, Charles Schwab felt compelled to come out publicly and reassure investors its liquidity remained strong.Shares of the brokerage firm have lost nearly 40% so far this year, including a more than 30% drop in March alone. Investors have feared pressure on Schwab's deposit base as clients move money from ""sweep accounts"" into higher-yielding alternatives that could impact the company's immediate access to capital.Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) results out Tuesday morning will offer another read on how larger lenders and investment banks fared during turmoil that centered on smaller, regional lenders.Investors will face a lighter schedule on the economic data side, as the monthly run of housing data picks up with homebuilder sentiment, home prices, and housing starts data all set to cross the wires.Wednesday's Beige Book report from the Fed will also set the table for the Fed's discussion of the economic environment at its next policy meeting, which is set to begin in just over two weeks on May 2. Data from the CME Group showed that as of the end of last week investors were placing a nearly 80% on the Fed raising rates by 0.25% in its next policy announcement.Last week's key economic report came Wednesday morning when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March showed headline inflation cooled to an annual rate of 5% in March while ""core"" inflation — which excludes the more volatile costs of food and energy — rose 5.6% over the last year.Retail sales and industrial production data out Friday, in addition to Thursday's initial claims reading, however, suggested the economy is softening on the margins and will likely weaken further in the coming months.""Incoming data signal the economy ended the first quarter on a weak note, with consumers less willing to spend, labor market conditions softening, and industrial sector output on a negative track,"" wrote Oren Klachkin, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients on Friday.""We believe Q1 will end up being the best quarter this year for the economy as tighter credit conditions and elevated interest rates slow GDP growth to a crawl in Q2 and spark a recession in the second half of the year. The weaker economy will ease price pressures, but not enough for the Fed to achieve its 2% inflation target anytime soon.""This combination of a slowing economy and stubborn inflation is likely to make investor debate about the Fed's next move even more robust in the coming months as the central bank balances risks that each call for the opposite policy response.As Barclays economist Marc Giannoni wrote in a note to clients on Friday: ""Fed communication earlier this week suggests that the debate about the course of policy is about to heat up.""Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference at the Federal Reserve, Wednesday, March 22, 2023, in Washington.

On the year, the Nasdaq Composite is up a cool 15% with social media platform Meta up close to 80% and chip darling Nvidia up 84%.“I've been surprised that the market has been as resilient as it has been only because normally when you see this kind of dramatic rise in interest rates over the last 12 months, you would expect GDP to go down and you expect people talking about recession more than they are,"" Rubenstein added. ""So far it seems unlikely we're going to have a recession this year, or less likely than people once thought.”That call could hinge on what the Fed does, as is often the case.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

But in contrast you can make much more than 100% if the company does well. For example, the Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) share price has soared 243% in the last three years. Most would be happy with that. And in the last month, the share price has gained 16%.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Schlumberger moved from a loss to profitability. That kind of transition can be an inflection point that justifies a strong share price gain, just as we have seen here.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Schlumberger has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. Take a more thorough look at Schlumberger's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Schlumberger's TSR for the last 3 years was 263%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Schlumberger shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 23% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 2% per year over the last half decade. We generally put more weight on the long term performance over the short term, but the recent improvement could hint at a (positive) inflection point within the business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. For example, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Schlumberger that you should be aware of before investing here.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

On Friday, JPMorgan (JPM) led a rally in bank stocks, rising more than 7% for its best day since 2020.""This week, the initial earnings from a few very large banks suggest that the quick work of the FDIC and Federal Reserve in the wake of Silicon Valley Bank's failure [has] prevented broader damage,"" strategists at Bespoke Investment Group wrote in a note to clients on Friday.""Lenders including PNC Financial, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, and Citi reported Friday, and the sigh of relief from markets was palpable.""JPMorgan's results revealed the bank ""has been a port in the storm,"" wrote Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo in a note on Friday. Mayo said the set of results released Friday left him asking — What banking crisis?JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon even went so far as to tell an analyst during Friday's conference call, ""I wouldn't use the word credit crunch, if I were you.""Still, Dimon cautioned the US economy will face challenges in the months ahead, writing in the company's earnings release, ""the storm clouds that we have been monitoring for the past year remain on the horizon, and the banking industry turmoil adds to these risks.""Higher rates, the war in Ukraine, and geopolitical tensions are among the factors Dimon cited as posing risks to the economy.Story continuesJamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, testifies during the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee hearing titled Annual Oversight of the Nations Largest Banks, in Hart Building on Thursday, September 22, 2022. (Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)The financial sector will remain in focus in the early part of the week ahead, with results from Charles Schwab (SCHW) on Monday providing a key look at how some firms at the center of last month's bank crisis fared during the quarter. During the peak of March's bank crisis, Charles Schwab felt compelled to come out publicly and reassure investors its liquidity remained strong.Shares of the brokerage firm have lost nearly 40% so far this year, including a more than 30% drop in March alone. Investors have feared pressure on Schwab's deposit base as clients move money from ""sweep accounts"" into higher-yielding alternatives that could impact the company's immediate access to capital.Bank of America (BAC) and Goldman Sachs (GS) results out Tuesday morning will offer another read on how larger lenders and investment banks fared during turmoil that centered on smaller, regional lenders.Investors will face a lighter schedule on the economic data side, as the monthly run of housing data picks up with homebuilder sentiment, home prices, and housing starts data all set to cross the wires.Wednesday's Beige Book report from the Fed will also set the table for the Fed's discussion of the economic environment at its next policy meeting, which is set to begin in just over two weeks on May 2. Data from the CME Group showed that as of the end of last week investors were placing a nearly 80% on the Fed raising rates by 0.25% in its next policy announcement.Last week's key economic report came Wednesday morning when the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for March showed headline inflation cooled to an annual rate of 5% in March while ""core"" inflation — which excludes the more volatile costs of food and energy — rose 5.6% over the last year.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Retail sales and industrial production data out Friday, in addition to Thursday's initial claims reading, however, suggested the economy is softening on the margins and will likely weaken further in the coming months.""Incoming data signal the economy ended the first quarter on a weak note, with consumers less willing to spend, labor market conditions softening, and industrial sector output on a negative track,"" wrote Oren Klachkin, lead US economist at Oxford Economics, in a note to clients on Friday.""We believe Q1 will end up being the best quarter this year for the economy as tighter credit conditions and elevated interest rates slow GDP growth to a crawl in Q2 and spark a recession in the second half of the year. The weaker economy will ease price pressures, but not enough for the Fed to achieve its 2% inflation target anytime soon.""This combination of a slowing economy and stubborn inflation is likely to make investor debate about the Fed's next move even more robust in the coming months as the central bank balances risks that each call for the opposite policy response.As Barclays economist Marc Giannoni wrote in a note to clients on Friday: ""Fed communication earlier this week suggests that the debate about the course of policy is about to heat up.""Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell speaks during a news conference at the Federal Reserve, Wednesday, March 22, 2023, in Washington.

However, there’s a positive consensus outlook among analysts when it comes to TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) stock. After delving into the data, it’s easy to see why the analyst community would favor TJX Companies.TJX Companies is known for operating TJ Maxx, Marshalls and other department store chains. Some investors might be afraid to delve into retail apparel stocks because the economy is on shaky ground. Yet, there’s no need to worry about TJX Companies in 2023.TJX Companies showed impressive resilience when inflation ran hot and recession fears surfaced. Plus, TJX Companies remained committed to respecting its investors by providing consistent dividends and repurchasing its own shares. At the end of the day, you’ll likely agree with the experts that TJX Companies is a standout among U.S. apparel names.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsTJXTJX Companies$77.90Analysts Agree on TJX StockNow, here’s something you probably won’t see every day. Out of 11 analysts, every one of them rated TJX stock a “buy” (or the equivalent of a “buy”). Hence, the consensus rating on the stock is a “strong buy.”The average analyst price target on TJX Companies shares is $90.73, which implies decent upside potential. Analysts with JPMorgan Chase and Telsey Advisory Group are more ambitious, as they separately issued $95 price targets on the stock.There are several reasons that Wall Street’s experts might favor TJX stock. TJX Companies was consistently profitable in 2021 and 2022. Also, if they’re seeking a relatively good value, they may have noticed that TJX Companies’ GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 26.28x is far below the company’s five-year average P/E ratio of 84.66x.TJX Companies’ Impressive ResiliencePerhaps the best reason for analysts to like TJX Companies, however, is the company’s resilience. Elevated inflation has been problematic for some apparel retailers, no doubt. Yet, TJX Companies has actually thrived because the company offers popular clothing brands to shoppers at reasonable prices.Story continuesWithout a doubt, being a discount retailer has helped TJX Companies to demonstrate strength during these challenging times. TJX Companies recently approved a 13% increase the company’s quarterly dividend. TJX Companies plans to implement $2 billion to $2.5 billion worth of share repurchases during fiscal 2024. This is a company that thinks about its shareholders.TJX Companies’ fiscal figures were positive during fiscal 2023’s fourth quarter. The company reported diluted earnings per share of 89 cents, up 14% year over year (YOY) and at the high end of TJX Companies’ plan.Not only that, but TJX Companies’ quarterly net sales increased 4.8% YOU to $14.52 billion, and beat Wall Street’s consensus estimate of $14.07 billion. Clearly, TJX Companies is able to draw crowds of shoppers even when the headlines suggest a recession may be imminent.What You Can Do NowThere’s positive consensus among analysts regarding TJX Companies, but it’s important for each investor to conduct his or her own due diligence. The idea isn’t to own a stock just because the experts like it.Still, it’s easy to see why the experts are optimistic about TJX Companies. The company showed sales and earnings growth during a rocky time for the economy. In addition, TJX Companies will continue to pay out dividends and plans to buy back its own shares.

Silver X Mining Corp. engages in the exploration, acquisition, and development of mineral properties in the Americas. The CA$66m market-cap company announced a latest loss of US$9.2m on 31 December 2022 for its most recent financial year result. Many investors are wondering about the rate at which Silver X Mining will turn a profit, with the big question being “when will the company breakeven?” In this article, we will touch on the expectations for the company's growth and when analysts expect it to become profitable. Check out our latest analysis for Silver X Mining According to some industry analysts covering Silver X Mining, breakeven is near. They expect the company to post a final loss in 2022, before turning a profit of US$6.1m in 2023. So, the company is predicted to breakeven approximately a year from now or less! How fast will the company have to grow to reach the consensus forecasts that anticipate breakeven by 2023? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 106% year-on-year, on average, which signals high confidence from analysts. If this rate turns out to be too aggressive, the company may become profitable much later than analysts predict.earnings-per-share-growthWe're not going to go through company-specific developments for Silver X Mining given that this is a high-level summary, but, take into account that by and large a metal and mining business has lumpy cash flows which are contingent on the natural resource mined and stage at which the company is operating. So, a high growth rate is not out of the ordinary, particularly when a company is in a period of investment.Before we wrap up, there’s one aspect worth mentioning. The company has managed its capital prudently, with debt making up 4.7% of equity. This means that it has predominantly funded its operations from equity capital, and its low debt obligation reduces the risk around investing in the loss-making company.Story continuesNext Steps:There are key fundamentals of Silver X Mining which are not covered in this article, but we must stress again that this is merely a basic overview.

39,69ff59e8-e503-38cf-9525-e98c1717e077,QCOM,2023-04-16,QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 75%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qualcomm-incorporated-nasdaq-qcom-favorite-130031167.html,1681563631,STORY,['QCOM'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies QUALCOMM's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions44% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Insiders have been selling lately To get a sense of who is truly in control of QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 75% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about QUALCOMM. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About QUALCOMM?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.QUALCOMM already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of QUALCOMM, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in QUALCOMM. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.9% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.6% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.2% of the company stock.Story continuesA deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of QUALCOMMThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of QUALCOMM Incorporated. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$162m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 25% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over QUALCOMM. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand QUALCOMM better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for QUALCOMM  that you should be aware of.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

However, recent trends indicate the sector is regaining momentum and returning with a bang.The technology sector heavily relies on the chip industry. These advanced engineering and manufacturing companies are critical to the global economy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, the industry is prone to sales volatility because of its cyclical nature, despite impressive long-term returns.In 2021, the chip industry revenue grew by 25%, surpassing $580 billion worldwide, thanks partly to a global chip shortage that has helped support prices. The demand for microchips and electronic components is growing exponentially because of their use in various products. Hence, semiconductor producers with manufacturing sites are investing to increase production capability.As a result, according to McKinsey, a global management consulting firm, the semiconductor industry will become a trillion-dollar industry by 2030 and experience a decade of growth. It comes as no surprise, considering the critical role chips will play in AI.As a result, countries are battling it out for chip supremacy, and chip companies are in the crossfire.With that kind of momentum, investors covet chip stocks.If you’re an investor interested in chip stocks, this is the perfect moment to invest in these high-quality companies with the potential for further growth.TSMTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company$87.97AVGOBroadcom$620.83QCOMQualcomm$121.13Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM)Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.Source: sdx15 / Shutterstock.comTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is the largest microchip manufacturer. It has achieved this position by investing in increasingly advanced chip fabrication capabilities.Story continuesWith fabs in two countries, Taiwan and the US, TSM can perform intricate chip designs. Its current market share of fabrication surpasses 50%, making them an industry leader.Despite its manufacturing prowess, the company has sustained rising demand and maintained an operating profit margin of at least 30% over the past decade. In 2022, TSM reported a 32.6% YoY increase in annual revenue to $75.881 billion.The company persists in reinvesting in production. It provides shareholders with a modest dividend, despite challenging operating conditions. Plus, any slowdown in demand is temporary.TSMC expects strong chip demand using its 3-nanometer (nm) process in the next three years. The company’s 3nm chip supply for 2023 is fully used, with top customers like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) incorporating these chips into their data centers and smartphones.Investors are flocking to the stock this year because of these factors, leading to a 20.55% year-to-date increase in share price. This puts Taiwan Semiconductor in a rare position among chip stocks. For those looking for a dependable investment in microchip expansion, Taiwan Semiconductor is a good choice.Broadcom (AVGO)broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office buildingSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.comBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) provides crucial electrical parts and components across various sectors, including 5G mobile network development, data centers, and industrial equipment.While not the highest-growth chip business on the list, Broadcom has expanded steadily for years. Acquisitions have been key to Broadcom’s success.Broadcom’s revenue rose by 21% in fiscal 2022 because of strong demand for chips in various markets. This growth sped up from its 15% increase in fiscal 2021.CEO Hock Tan noted that robust infrastructure spending led to sustained demand across most of Broadcom’s end markets despite concerns about a global recession.Thanks to this, the organization could continuously expand its primary business. Broadcom’s scale enabled it to consistently grow margins, with adjusted EBITDA rising 27% and margin expanding to 63.3%. Annual FCF also grew 22% to $16.3 billion, increasing FCF’s margin to 49.1%.Broadcom strives to return approximately 50% of the free cash flow from the previous year back to its shareholders. This has been their policy for quite some time now.This is done through dividends and supplements dividends with share repurchases, making it an attractive option for those seeking investment income from chip stocks.Qualcomm (QCOM)Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.Source: jejim / Shutterstock.comQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM), a leading chip industry player in the 2000s and 2010s, succeeded by tapping into the smartphone boom.However, with the market becoming more mature, Qualcomm shifted its focus to remain relevant. Fortunately, 5G mobile networks has opened up a new growth avenue for the company.Although Qualcomm is primarily known for designing smartphone microchips, it also produces network equipment components that create mobile signals.

Pictured are travelers relaxing in a garden. Source: Unsplash/Priscilla Du Preez Priscilla Du Preez / UnsplashExpedia Group, which is combining its Expedia and Hotels.com rewards programs and extending it to Vrbo, hopes its upcoming One Key program will be used by regular people, or relatively infrequent travelers, and not just those who board first at the front of the line on major airlines.One Key is officially slated to launch “in mid-2023,” but the debut might be as soon as June. When the new loyalty plan launches, it will be U.S. only. Expedia Group has been emailing the 168 million members of its various loyalty programs — several Expedia brands have their own programs now — about various details about the new unified loyalty program.The consolidation of Expedia Group’s various loyalty schemes into one is part of its overall push to simplify the company’s far-flung operations, and to eliminate the complexity of several of its own loyalty plans competing against one another. Over the past couple of years, the Group has also dropped some brands, and combined various teams that were working at cross-purposes at times for its nearly two dozen brands.Travelers with a One Key account will be able to pile up OneKeyCash and use it on eligible bookings through Expedia, Hotels.com, and Vrbo — the Group’s recently anointed three core brands. It would be the first time that loyalty program members would be able to use rewards cash for Vrbo’s vacation rentals.One Key members who book a four-night hotel stay and a roundtrip flight would advance from the lowest Blue status to the Silver tier, where they would save 15 percent at participating hotels instead of 10 percent at the lower rung, the company said.The formerly separate and disparate Expedia Rewards and Hotels.com Rewards programs, the latter of which offered “1 reward night for every 10 nights you stay,” will be consolidated into One Key and extended to Vrbo, which didn’t have a loyalty scheme. The 168 million members of the Expedia Group rewards programs would be able to earn and burn OneKeyCash on all three brands while previously there was no such cross-brand utility.Story continuesTo qualify for a One Key account on day one, Expedia Group customers must have created an account in the U.S. on Expedia, Hotels.com or Vrbo, the company said. Expedia said members of its Orbitz Rewards program and other Expedia Group customers will be able to join One Key, as well.Not everyone will be happy about the transition from Hotels.com Rewards to One Key.“Suffice it to say that this represents a massive gutting of Hotels.com Rewards,” said a One Mile At a Time post. “Savvy travelers will go from earning the equivalent of a 10% reward on their stays, to earning the equivalent of 2% back on their stays. While you can earn up to 6% on some stays, this requires being Platinum, and only applies at ‘eligible VIP Access properties.'”However, an Expedia Group spokesperson said “95 percent of Hotels.com Rewards members do not earn enough stamps to redeem in a given year.”Expedia is also ending its existing triple bonus points on stays at its VIP Access hotels. Rewards on package bookings — typically flights plus hotel — can still be earned, but members won’t be able to use their OneKeyCash to redeem package bookings.In addition to the benefits to travelers, Expedia touted the upside to suppliers, who “will have access to high value travelers who are incremental to their own members.”“Unlike some competitors, Expedia Group funds the base earn and use for OneKeyCash,” Expedia Group stated.That latter statement could be a dig at Booking.com. Participating hotels fund a substantial portion of its Genius loyalty program rewards.Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

However, we decided to study the company's mixed-bag of fundamentals to assess what this could mean for future share prices, as stock prices tend to be aligned with a company's long-term financial performance. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Medtronic's  ROE today.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Medtronic How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Medtronic is:7.9% = US$4.1b ÷ US$52b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.08 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.Medtronic's Earnings Growth And 7.9% ROEWhen you first look at it, Medtronic's ROE doesn't look that attractive. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 10%. Medtronic was still able to see a decent net income growth of 6.1% over the past five years. So, the growth in the company's earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. For instance, the company has a low payout ratio or is being managed efficiently.Story continuesWe then compared Medtronic's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 14% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. If you're wondering about Medtronic's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Medtronic Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 75% (or a retention ratio of 25%) for Medtronic suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Additionally, Medtronic has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company is expected to drop to 53% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 14%, over the same period.SummaryOverall, we have mixed feelings about Medtronic. While the company has posted a decent earnings growth, We do feel that the earnings growth number could have been even higher, had the company been reinvesting more of its earnings at a higher rate of return. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

(“Prometheus”) (Nasdaq: RXDX) today announced that the companies have entered into a definitive agreement under which Merck, through a subsidiary, has agreed to acquire Prometheus for $200.00 per share in cash for a total equity value of approximately $10.8 billion.“At Merck, we are committed to delivering on our purpose to save and improve lives and continue to identify and secure opportunities where compelling science and value creation align,” said Robert M. Davis, chairman and chief executive officer, Merck. “The agreement with Prometheus will accelerate our growing presence in immunology where there remains substantial unmet patient need. This transaction adds diversity to our overall portfolio and is an important building block as we strengthen the sustainable innovation engine that will drive our growth well into the next decade.”Prometheus is a clinical-stage biotechnology company pioneering a precision medicine approach for the discovery, development, and commercialization of novel therapeutic and companion diagnostic products for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases. The company’s lead candidate, PRA023, is a humanized monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-like ligand 1A (TL1A), a target associated with both intestinal inflammation and fibrosis.“Prometheus was established to revolutionize the treatment of immune-mediated diseases through the application of a powerful precision medicine approach,” said Mark McKenna, chairman and chief executive officer of Prometheus Biosciences. “This agreement with Merck, a leader in biopharmaceutical research and development, allows Prometheus to maximize the potential for PRA023, while continuing to apply our technology and expertise to fuel further discoveries to address the needs of patients with immune disorders.”Story continuesPrometheus is developing PRA023 for the treatment of immune-mediated diseases including ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn’s disease (CD), and other autoimmune conditions. In December 2022, the company announced positive results for PRA023 from ARTEMIS-UC, a Phase 2, placebo controlled, study evaluating safety and efficacy in patients with moderate to severely active UC and APOLLO-CD a Phase 2A, open-label, study evaluating safety and efficacy in patients with moderate to severe CD. The findings were recently presented at the 18th Congress of European Crohn’s and Colitis Organisation (ECCO).“By applying a portfolio of powerful analytic tools to a comprehensive collection of IBD samples, Prometheus identified important disease insights that have now yielded a promising late-stage candidate,” said Dr. Dean Y. Li, president, Merck Research Laboratories. “I look forward to working with the talented Prometheus team to establish a new paradigm of precision treatment for immune diseases.”Under the terms of the acquisition agreement, Merck, through a subsidiary, will acquire all of the outstanding shares of Prometheus. The acquisition is subject to Prometheus Biosciences shareholder approval. The closing of the proposed transaction will be subject to certain conditions, including the expiration of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and other customary conditions. The transaction is expected to close in the third quarter of 2023.         A copy of the merger agreement pursuant to the transaction will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and will be publicly available.

The Fed projected rates coming down to 4.3% by the end of 2024.Since the Fed’s March meeting, however, various Fed officials have sent conflicting views to market participants.Boston Fed President Susan Collins and Richmond Fed President Tom Barkin both struck hawkish tones in speeches in the week following the Fed decision.The same inflation-fighting stance was assumed by Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari this week in public comments.“Inflation is still very high,” New York Fed President John Williams said in an exclusive interview with Yahoo Finance Live on Tuesday, striking a hawkish tone of his own.U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell (L) participates in a luncheon discussion hosted by Economic Club President David Rubenstein in Washington, U.S., January 10, 2019. REUTERS/Jim YoungOn the other end of the spectrum is new Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, whose thinking on the rate outlook echoed the plugged-in high financier Rubenstein.""At moments like this of financial stress, the right monetary approach calls for prudence and patience,” Goolsbee told the Economic Club of Chicago.Story continuesThe mixed messages from the Fed reflect an economy that's still showing signs of being too hot for the string-pullers at the institution.The labor market created a solid 236,000 jobs in March, per the latest non-farm payrolls report. And although March’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) cooled from February, it still showed a 5% year-over-year headline increase.CEOs continue to tell Yahoo Finance they are eyeing fresh rounds of price increases due to stubborn inflation in areas such as packaging and labor.Carlyle’s Rubenstein says he has been surprised that the stock market has clung to gains in the face of the aggressive Fed rate hiking campaign and economic growth slowdown that may extend into the fall, much to the dismay of investors.The gains in markets have come especially hot and heavy in tech stocks that historically tend to respond well to a low-rate environment. On the year, the Nasdaq Composite is up a cool 15% with social media platform Meta up close to 80% and chip darling Nvidia up 84%.“I've been surprised that the market has been as resilient as it has been only because normally when you see this kind of dramatic rise in interest rates over the last 12 months, you would expect GDP to go down and you expect people talking about recession more than they are,"" Rubenstein added. ""So far it seems unlikely we're going to have a recession this year, or less likely than people once thought.”That call could hinge on what the Fed does, as is often the case.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

That caveat is the federal $7,500 EV tax credit which then makes it cheaper than the Nissan Leaf, which does not qualify for the tax credit.That said, my choice in the cheap EV segment is the Bolt EUV, which is the larger crossover version of the Bolt, and starts at $27,800. The Bolt EUV has nearly 57 cubic feet of cargo space and slightly more than 39 inches of rear-seat legroom, quite a feat for a car with such a small footprint. With 247 miles on a full charge, the Bolt EUV has more than enough range for most American commuters, who will likely have to charge a couple times a week.Inside, the car is appointed nicely with comfortable seats, and nice tech like dual digital displays and CarPlay (wireless!). Going up a trim level to premier gives you GM’s highly touted SuperCruise highway hands-free assistance tech and nice cabin materials like leather seats.With a front-wheel motor setup, the car handles nicely in and around town with adequate power and agility with its low center of gravity. The Bolt EUV might be the perfect daily driver for those looking for a cheap commuter to gobble up miles.The trusty sedan - Polestar 2Polestar 2 US Launch August 2020 Copyright FreeStarts at $48,400Range: 270 miles (Long range single motor)From the shores of Sweden comes the Polestar 2 sedan. On sale since 2020, the 2023 Polestar (PSNY) 2 features both a front-motor setup or dual motor all-wheel drive configuration, with the AWD version getting huge horsepower numbers (476 hp), but the single-motor version getting the longer range (270 miles).Story continuesAt $48,400, the Polestar 2 is knocking on the door of the luxury segment, though its current price is essentially the average price for a new car in the U.S. Buyers get a lot for the money, however, with good looks, nice interior materials and fit and finish, and Google-powered tech for deep integration with infotainment and the car’s other systems.When I drove the launch edition of the vehicle, the car felt light where it needed to be, with firm steering, and the ability to get you out of trouble quickly with a stab of the accelerator. It's a sporty little sedan, and for the 2024 model year the single-motor version moves the motor to the rear of the car for better performance, and Polestar is promising more range too.America’s choice, the SUV - Ford Mustang Mach-EFord Mustang Mach-E is presented at the New York International Auto Show, in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., April 5, 2023. REUTERS/David 'Dee' DelgadoStarts at $45,995Range: 247 miles (standard range battery and RWD)The debate about whether this crossover SUV is a Mustang or not rages on, but the vehicle's sales are raging as well. Ford (F) sold another 5,500 Mach-E’s in the first quarter, and could have sold more, but the automaker was supply constrained due to downtime at the factory.When I tested the car in 2021, the first year it was on sale, I wrote, “The Mach E, with its dual motor, AWD system is mighty impressive. Like most EVs, the acceleration is brisk right off the bat, and the Mach-E is no exception. What makes it even more of a standout is the chassis and suspension tuning.”While that AWD version will set you back $51,000, the value-oriented standard range with rear-wheel drive setup gets you 247 miles of range, and a 0-60 mph time of 5.8 seconds, all for $45,995. And, the Mach-E qualifies for the federal EV tax credit of $7,500.The pickup truck - Rivian R1TThe Rivian R1T pickupStarts at $73,000Range: 270 miles (dual motor, standard battery pack)A bit of an aspirational play here, the Rivian R1T is more of an adventure truck than a work truck. But let’s be honest, most people these days are buying a pickup as a lifestyle choice.In that vein, the Rivian (RIVN) is the perfect specimen. Clean lines, oodles of utility with a frunk and “gear tunnel,” and a near luxury-car interior give the Rivian the edge in the EV pickup space. Add capabilities like a quad-motor design, air suspension, and upcoming max battery pack and this truck can do it all—and it can drive like a sports car on the pavement with breakneck acceleration.Whether Rivian can ramp up and meet demand is one of the bigger worries for the automaker. The dual motor version of the truck is coming this spring, sporting over 600hp and 270 miles of range with the standard battery pack. At $74,000, this version of the R1T also qualifies for the federal EV tax credit.The luxury GT cruiser - Lucid AirThe Lucid Air Grand TouringStarts at $87,400Range: 410 miles (AWD equipped)If you're in that market for a high-end, super-performing electric sedan, the Lucid (LCID) is an unbelievable package.California-based Lucid made headlines years ago with the stunning design of its Air sedan. Combined with its Formula E motor, inverter, and battery technology, the company has the chops to make a legit luxury sport cruiser, and it has done so with the Air.The Grand Touring Performance I tested earlier this year touted over 1000 hp, 514 miles of range, all packaged in a luxurious cabin that exceeded the levels of any EV-maker today. The power delivery from the powertrain was immense, though tuned in a way that made the drive sublime.Though the company has sold its top trim levels like the Dream and Grand Touring thus far, Lucid’s Pure version of the car will be coming out soon, featuring a rear-wheel motor design, over 400 hp, and price tag of around $87,400.—Pras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

57,b7db42cf-18f6-3a6e-b1a6-1c64da6e23d0,GM,2023-04-16,7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy for 100% Returns,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-blue-chip-stocks-buy-233423283.html,1681342463,STORY,"['BAC', 'BTI', 'PFE', 'CVS', 'PYPL', 'ALB', 'GM']","[Typically, blue-chip stocks to buy don’t attract attention for their sheer upside potential. Rather, these enterprises bank on their established businesses to provide steady rewards for their stakeholders. In perhaps most cases, we’re talking about a modest combination of passive income and capital gains. However, a select few stalwarts may be capable of doubling their market value.Primarily, blue-chip stocks to buy that offer triple-digit return potential do so because of incurring sharp volatility. Basically, investors at large might not see the possible upside return in the discount in the charts. However, for the intrepid market participant, underappreciated blue chips may be quite an opportunity. Below are seven such names to consider.BACBank of America$28.48CVSCVS Health$74.92PFEPfizer$41.37GMGeneral Motors$34.62ALBAlbemarle$201.70BTIBritish American Tobacco$35.45PYPLPayPal$73.50InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBank of America (BAC)a bull next to a stack of blue gambling chips to represent blue-chip stocksSource: ShutterstockAlthough Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) is one of the biggest financial institutions in the nation, it wasn’t completely immune from the banking sector fallout. Since the beginning of this year, BAC stock gave up more than 14% of equity value. Nevertheless, because it ranks among the biggest blue-chip stocks to buy, some contrarians might believe it’s due for big returns.Now, are we talking about 100% returns? Admittedly, I probably wouldn’t go that far. Presently, Wall Street analysts peg BAC as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $37.89, implying nearly 32% upside potential. In fairness, that’s quite a haul for one of the well-known blue-chip stocks to buy.Moreover, the most optimistic target sees BAC hitting $48 a pop. From the time of writing, reaching this level would imply upside of over 67%. That’s pretty darn close to doubling. Plus, BAC might be undervalued based on discounted cash flow (DCF). Therefore, it’s one of the blue-chip stocks to buy for speculators.Story continuesCVS Health (CVS)A close-up shot of a blue casino chip on red carpet.Source: ShutterstockAnother popular name among the large-capitalization enterprises, CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) suffered a decline in relevance. With social normalization trends in full bloom, CVS hasn’t been able to attract positive investor interest. Since the Jan. opener, shares fell nearly 18%. In the trailing year, they’re down 27%.Nevertheless, red ink tends to attract contrarian market participants and that may be the case here. Notably, Wall Street analysts peg CVS as a consensus strong buy. Overall, their average price target stands at $112.10, implying 47% upside potential. Again, that’s quite a forecast for one of the blue-chip stocks to buy.However, the most optimistic expert sees CVS hitting $143 per share. From the present juncture, if the stock reaches that high, it would translate to a return of over 87%. That’s not shabby at all for such a large enterprise. Also, it’s worth noting that the market prices CVS at a forward multiple of only 8.65. In contrast, the sector median value is 14.62 times.Pfizer (PFE)blue chip definition highlightedSource: ShutterstockSeemingly everyone’s favorite pharmaceutical company during the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the fading of the crisis meant that Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) unfortunately lost significant relevance. Check out – it’s always been relevant. However, without the intense fervor surrounding the Covid vaccine, PFE just lost some of its prior edge. Still, it could be one of the compelling blue-chip stocks to buy.On paper, Pfizer doesn’t seem that remarkable. Yes, covering analysts peg PFE as a consensus moderate buy. However, their average price target comes out to $48.36, implying just under 16% upside potential. That’s not exactly a doubling.However, the most optimistic analyst anticipates that PFE might reach $75 per share. If the pharmaceutical giant gets that high, the move would translate to more than 79% up. Now that would be darn close to 100%, especially for a blue chip. Also, Pfizer benefits from a solid balance sheet, strong growth and outstanding profitability. Thus, it wouldn’t be too much of a stretch to see PFE swing sharply northward.General Motors (GM)a pile of blue chips on top of a newspaperSource: ShutterstockAlthough General Motors (NYSE:GM) is a legacy automaker, the company pivoted aggressively toward electric vehicles. Further, by converting some of its marquee models to electric power, it may potentially own an automotive goldmine. Over the long run, GM easily ranks among the blue-chip stocks to buy. And yes, with enough time, shares could conceivably double in value.For now, Wall Street analysts peg GM as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at a whopping $52.91, implying more than 49% upside potential. Right there, we’re already off to a great start. However, the most optimistic target sees GM hitting $86 a pop. If so, a move to this level would mean a return of nearly 143%.Could it get there? Notably, the market prices GM at a forward multiple of 6.15. As a discount to projected earnings, GM ranks better than 83.43% of the competition. Again, it may require patience but GM might return 100% or more.Albemarle (ALB)Source: ShutterstockSpeaking of EVs, everyone seemingly states that the future of mobility will be electric. And that very well might be the case. However, picking out which brands may come out on top will be a difficult endeavor. For those that want to bank more on the infrastructural spectrum, Albemarle (NYSE:ALB) should be on your radar for blue-chip stocks to buy. As a top lithium producer, Albemarle provides what all EVs need.Unsurprisingly, many analysts have high hopes for ALB stock, though it’s a contested arena. Wall Street’s experts peg ALB as a consensus moderate buy. While their average price target stands at $306.19, thereby implying nearly 52% upside potential, three analysts pegged ALB a sell. Therefore, a cautionary approach may be required.That said, the most optimistic expert believes that ALB can hit $498 per share. Should Albemarle reach this lofty objective, it would translate to almost 147% upside. On the financial front, Albemarle benefits from decent balance sheet stability and excellent revenue and profitability metrics. Thus, it might have a chance of doubling.British American Tobacco (BTI)Source: ShutterstockA controversial name among blue-chip stocks to buy, British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) is a multinational company that manufactures and sells cigarettes, tobacco and other nicotine products. Because of declining smoking prevalence, many investors might not see the point in BTI stock. However, the company also makes vaporizer/e-cigarette products, which cynically offer a popular framework. Thus, BTI could be interesting from an investment perspective.Presently, covering analysts peg BTI as a consensus moderate buy. Their highest price target stands at $57.34, implying over 61% upside potential. And because only two experts cover BTI, there’s not much in terms of price forecast diversification.Financially, BTI may also intrigue speculators because of its value proposition. The market prices shares at a forward multiple of 7.36. As a discount to projected earnings, BTI ranks better than 78.57% of companies listed in the tobacco industry. Also, it trades at 6.62-times free cash flow, lower than the sector median value of 11.93 times.PayPal (PYPL)10 Small-Cap Stocks to Buy Before They Grow UpSource: ShutterstockOne of the most relevant blue-chip stocks to buy, digital payments platform PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) appears stuck in a downtrend. Unfortunately, the skyrocketing inflation of 2022 combined with rising competition in the payments space pressured PYPL. So far this year, PYPL is only down a bit more than 1%. However, in the past 365 days, PYPL gave up 32% of equity value.Still, for contrarian investors, PayPal might be an intriguing pickup. Currently, analysts peg PYPL as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $113.45, implying over 54% upside potential. What’s more, the most optimistic target comes in at a staggering $357.40. If PYPL gets there, we’re talking about a return of nearly 386%.Of course, it’s difficult to say if PayPal can reach such an ambitious target. However, the company benefits from a solid cash balance relative to its tech peers. Also, it prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 16.7%, beating out 77.4% of rivals.

58,d7e749bf-bea3-3d65-a04f-f9e65c003586,TGT,2023-04-16,Target (NYSE:TGT) shareholders have earned a 21% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-nyse-tgt-shareholders-earned-140027203.html,1681567227,STORY,['TGT'],"[When you buy a stock there is always a possibility that it could drop 100%. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. Long term Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 129% in five years. It's down 2.8% in the last seven days.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Target While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Target managed to grow its earnings per share at 2.6% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 18% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. And that's hardly shocking given the track record of growth.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Target's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Target, it has a TSR of 157% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 6.7% in the twelve months, Target shareholders did even worse, losing 31% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 21%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   5 warning signs for Target   (of which 1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) you should know about.Of course Target may not be the best stock to buy.

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Genuine Parts' current trading price of US$165 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Genuine Parts’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Genuine Parts What Is Genuine Parts Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 2.20% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Genuine Parts today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $161.51, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. In addition to this, Genuine Parts has a low beta, which suggests its share price is less volatile than the wider market.Can we expect growth from Genuine Parts?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 31% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Genuine Parts. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? GPC’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on GPC, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Genuine Parts as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

Voting closes on Monday and the tally is expected to be released shortly after.The strike authorization vote is meant to turn up the heat on companies such as Netflix Inc and Walt Disney Co and convince them to raise the pay for writers, who say their compensation has suffered because of the streaming revolution, which resulted in shorter TV seasons and smaller residual payments.""We feel like we've been undervalued for years,"" said John August, a screenwriter who sits on the Guild negotiating committee.A prolonged strike could be costly.The last WGA strike, in 2007 and 2008, lasted 100 days. TV networks broadcast re-runs and more reality shows, while the cost to the California economy was estimated at $2.1 billion, according to the Milken Institute. Most TV and film writers live in Los Angeles or New York.Studios do not want another disruption, particularly after COVID-19 shut down production worldwide for months.Film and television work has rebounded, but movie-going remains below pre-pandemic levels, despite blockbusters such as ""Avatar: The Way of Water."" The broadcast television business also is struggling, as viewers and ad dollars migrate to streaming.August said writers believe the timing is right to push for higher pay as media companies work to find the right balance between spending and profits from streaming.""This is the moment to really have a conversation about how we're making television right now and making sure writers are paid properly,"" August said.Story continuesPAY, WRITING ROOMS AND AIThe WGA is seeking increases in minimum salaries plus changes to practices that reduce pay, such as smaller ""mini-rooms"" of writers hired before production.Half of TV series writers now work at minimum salary levels, compared to one-third in the 2013-2014 season, according to Guild statistics. Median pay for scribes at the higher writer/producer level has fallen 4% over the last decade.Sources close to studios counter that budgets are tight at a time when Wall Street wants to see profits from multi-billion dollar streaming investments that are draining balance sheets.Disney, for example, is laying off 7,000 people as it tries to cut $5.5 billion in costs. Warner Bros Discovery, created by a recent merger, recently announced it would re-vamp its streaming efforts as it chases profitability.Writers also have greater opportunities than ever to find work, with a record 599 scripted shows released in 2022. Residuals paid to TV writers hit an unprecedented $493.6 million in 2021.The Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which represents Comcast Corp, Disney, Warner Bros, Netflix and others, said in a statement that it was committed to ""reaching a mutually beneficial deal.""""We're optimistic that we can get through this,"" Warner Bros Discovery Chief Executive David Zaslav said at a recent press conference, but added, ""We're assuming the worst from a business perspective. We've got ourselves ready. We have a lot of content that's been produced.""Another issue is the emergence of artificial intelligence. The WGA wants safeguards to prevent studios from using AI to generate new scripts from writers' previous work. Writers also want to ensure they are not asked to rewrite draft scripts created by AI.A strike authorization does not mean a work stoppage will happen. In 2017, WGA members authorized a strike but reached a deal hours before writers headed to picket lines.If a strike is called, audiences would first see the impact on late-night talk shows, which use teams of writers to pen topical jokes. Daytime soap operas would be next. Many comedies and dramas are filmed months in advance, giving them a longer lead time before fresh episodes would run out.Movies are written at least two years in advance so near-term releases in cinemas would not be affected.

While many of the old tech stocks have done well lately, they seem to be forgotten about by investors. But are they still tech stocks to buy?Many of these stocks bring attractive qualities to the table. In some cases, it’s a nice dividend yield or low valuation. In other cases, the stocks offer surprisingly attractive growth rates. You’d be surprised by how many high-quality firms are still out there generating strong growth in the tech sector.While all eyes seem to be on artificial intelligence and electric vehicles, there are many companies out there still churning out strong results from their legacy businesses. Let’s have a look at these three companies and fish for some tech stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comInvestors may not consider PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) to be an “old tech” name, but it’s a high-quality company that’s been around for quite some time. Now almost 25 years old, the company has played an integral part in online and digital payments.At the present time, though, the stock seems lost.PayPal was a growth stock, but currently its growth rates have decreased considerably. But does that make it a value stock? I’m unsure of the answer, yet I am perplexed on how to classify this one. Analysts expect about 7% revenue growth this year and almost 10% growth in 2024. As for earnings, estimates call for 18% and 15% growth in 2023 and next year, respectively.Despite all this, shares trade at just 15 times this year’s forecasted earnings. That’s darn cheap for solid earnings growth.The company delivered solid earnings and better-than-expected guidance but hasn’t been rewarded. When it will be, I don’t know. But if it keeps growing like this, the stock will eventually go higher.Oracle (ORCL)The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comStory continuesOracle (NYSE:ORCL) stock seems to fly under the radar, but is performing well. The stock is up 15% so far on the year and recently hit a 52-week high. Further, shares are currently down less than 10% from the all-time high.How many tech stocks are within 10% of their highs? Not many, I can tell you that.Analysts expect over 17% revenue growth this year, but just 3% earnings growth. In 2024, estimates call for 7.5% revenue growth and almost 11% earnings growth. While the outlook is admittedly a little mixed — for instance, it would be nice to see stronger earnings growth this year — it’s not necessarily bad. Plus, shares trade at about 18 times this year’s earnings.The stock pays out a 1.7% dividend yield to boot. It’s not the largest yield in the world, but it at least gives investors a little something for the buy-and-hold crowd.ASML Holding (ASML)Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboardSource: Ralf Liebhold / ShutterstockNot many people talk about ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML). This Netherland-based company sports a $267 billion market capitalization. From the company:“We’re moving technology forward. In fact, we’re probably a part of the electronic device you’re using right now. Our lithography technology is fundamental to mass producing semiconductor chips. With it, the world’s top chipmakers are creating microchips that are more powerful, faster and energy efficient.”Founded almost 40 years ago, the company is still chugging along quite nicely. Analysts expect almost 30% revenue growth this year and 10% growth next year. On the earnings front, it’s even more impressive. Consensus expectations call for 35% growth in 2023 and 21% growth in 2024.Admittedly, this one is a bit more expensive, trading at just over 30 times this year’s earnings. However, given the expected growth rates, it’s not surprising.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in PYPL.

These companies are household names with track records of steady growth and operational profitability in some cases over decades. They’ve weathered economic cyclicality and the recessions that come with it, making them particularly timely.We’re exploring those blue-chip stocks that beat the market in 2023. I define that as providing better returns than the average of the 7.35% return from the S&amp;P 500 year-to-date and the 1.05% return from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. So, we’re talking about shares that exceeded 4.2% returns in 2023, also listed here.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBlue-Chip Stocks: American Express (AXP)the American Express logo etched into woodSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.comAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is well-known for providing credit cards catering to more affluent customers. Those same affluent customers tend to be less affected by economic downturns. In turn, it’s logical to guess that the company stands to do better in the difficult environment this year. So far, that has been the case.American Express had a very strong 2022, during which it reached its goal of delivering 25% revenue growth. It did exactly that, reaching $52.86 billion in sales on payments volume that increased by a slightly smaller 21%.The company’s strategy focuses on acquiring more customers and growing that base. American Express established 12.5 million new card accounts in 2022. Investors should expect companywide EPS to increase by 15-17% in 2023. The company has rewarded investors for the strong year by planning to increase its dividend by 15%. American Express’s stable business and customer base give it advantages in this environment, suggesting continued strength.Boeing (BA)It Will Be a Very Long Road to Recovery for BA StockSource: ShutterstockStory continuesBoeing (NYSE:BA) is moving into a new chapter as sales ramp up and problems of the recent past fade. A strong sales trajectory and a backlog of business suggest that Boeing is back. That said, Boeing continues to have operational difficulties that resulted in net losses overall in 2022, a continuation of 2021 results.Boeing’s 2022 sales increased by 7% to $66.61 billion. Boeing suffered a net loss again in 2022 but posted a positive operating cash flow of $3.5 billion, largely due to Q4 results. That led to positive cash flows during the year.BA stock is trending upward in 2023 because the business is now headed in the right direction after major setbacks. Boeing delivered 480 commercial planes and recorded 808 orders overall. With supply chains returning to normal, Boeing should be able to better fulfill that backlog, including a large order of its 787 Dreamliners to Saudi carriers. Thus, it is among the top blue-chip stocks.Disney (DIS)dis stock the Disney logo in red font on a storefrontSource: David Tran Photo / Shutterstock.comDisney (NYSE:DIS) continues to grow at an impressive rate, especially for a firm of its size. Meanwhile, the company is undertaking efforts to reorganize to increase efficiency. Let’s focus on those two aspects of its story to understand why it does well even in a challenging economy.Disney’s fiscal year’s first quarter ends on Dec. 31, which, for most other firms, is the end of the fiscal year. Despite the slight difference, Disney moved into the new year with strong momentum on an 8% increase in sales. That solid growth increased EPS from $0.63 to $0.70 in Q1 year-over-year.Meanwhile, Disney is reorganizing for efficiency as the economy tightens. Structurally, the company has realigned its three core businesses, Entertainment, ESPN, Parks, Products, and Experiences, to be headed separately. The company believes the reorganization will reduce inefficiency leading to $5.5 billion in savings.McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.Source: Tama2u / ShutterstockLet’s face it, current headlines about McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) expose the brutal truth of business. Even when business and stock are strong, restructuring will continue to occur. Like Disney, another thriving business, McDonald’s is restructuring and conducting layoffs.McDonald’s began a round of layoffs beginning April 3, targeting hundreds of corporate employees. I can’t speak to their individual performance. They may indeed be less productive. But McDonald’s grew by 12% in Q4 with double-digit growth across all segments. During 2022, company-wide sales increased by 10%. Business is business, but there’s a human toll exacted that broad metrics simply can’t account for.The result of current layoffs is likely to be a boon to MCD stock from the perspective of the markets. It’ll be viewed as leaner and ready for the next growth cycle. McDonald’s has also continued to focus on affordability and a pared-down menu which are arguably strengths currently.Walmart (WMT)Walmart sign on front of Walmart store at sundownSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.comReaders are likely aware that Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is the world’s largest retailer. But the facts about its massive scale provide a bit more perspective for us to understand its relevance. Let’s look at some of those statistics.The world’s largest retailer tallied $572.75 billion in worldwide revenues in 2022 from its 10,953 locations, 4,650 of which are U.S. located. That means that 140 million customers visit Walmart every week.The company has become the largest grocery store in the U.S. as well. That’s probably not surprising to those of you who have visited recently: The grocery section dominates the store. However, what is interesting – at least to me – is that Walmart became the largest U.S. grocer back in 2001.I’m trying to make a simple point: Walmart continues to dominate in 2023 with low-price offerings, especially on staple items. That is a strong reason that its stock continues to perform well.General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comThe past is not a prologue. And that’s a positive for General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock which has provided negative annual returns over the last decade. The company had long been in a slow decline, and following years of declining revenues, it was dropped from the DJIA in 2018 as the last original component. 2023 has started very differently for the firm as it outperforms the market.The reason for the strong performance has to do with overarching trends and a military build-up. The firm’s new XA100 military jet engine is shrouded in mystery. Few outside the military have seen the engine, and those that recently did were allowed no recording devices in the room where it was displayed.GE hopes the engines will be fitted to sixth-generation fighter jets used by the U.S. and its allies. Rising tension in the Pacific ensures GE will continue to receive serious attention for the next few years at least. Thus, it is one of the top blue-chip stocks in my book.Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate buildingSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.com2022 was an exceptionally strong year for Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) as favorable market prices resulted in $55.74 billion in earnings. That was more than double the earnings Exxon Mobil reported a year earlier.But it’s difficult to maintain strength and grow quarter after quarter. Like all big oil firms, Exxon Mobil rewards investors willing to experience that volatility with revenues and share buybacks. Its dividend is extremely safe, having last been reduced in 1983. In any case, the point here is that Exxon Mobil, as a company, is adept at manipulating its share price to remain smooth despite volatile commodity markets.So, it does well even when the price of Brent crude trends is lower. However, it might not have to worry as much now about playing defensively. OPEC+ cut production, which suggests that per barrel prices should rise as firms scramble to fill the supply gap. That’s a positive catalyst for XOM stock which has done well over the last three years despite the tumult.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

That said, most folks like to take some chances now and again. So, when looking at speculative penny stocks, what should you keep in mind?It’s preferable to own companies that have demonstrated revenue generation and significant market demand. It’s one thing for a company to promise folks the moon and publish a bunch of press releases. It’s quite another to achieve tangible signs of commercial success as a smaller enterprise.Investors should also consider the potential upside. Speculative penny stocks are highly risky and could easily trade down to zero if things go unfavorably.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn return for shouldering that risk, a speculative penny stock must offer a strong payoff in a bullish outcome and have a reasonable chance of paying out. These three speculative penny stocks are among the small group of microcap names that offer traders an intriguing outlook at today’s prices.LLAPTerran Orbital$1.79LTRPALiberty TripAdvisor$0.77MAPSWM Technology$0.64Terran Orbital (LLAP)A vector image of two satellites orbiting above EarthSource: Illus_man / ShutterstockTerran Orbital (NYSE:LLAP) is a space company focused on producing micro-satellites. Shares got off to a bumpy start, with the former SPAC sliding from $10 last year to a low of just $1.29.But shares doubled earlier in 2023. That’s because Terran won a stunning $2.4 billion new contract with Rivada Space Networks. The contract specifies that Terran will build 288 low-earth satellites for Rivada. This deal was many multiples of Terran’s prior market capitalization, and also a massive increase to the company’s $198 million backlog prior to the Rivada deal.Canaccord analyst Austin Moeller has a buy on LLAP stock and sees dramatic upside. Moeller bases this view on the premise that small satellite demand will increase roughly sevenfold over the next decade. The Rivada deal, as large as it is now, would seem like small potatoes if the market grows to that degree.Story continuesAdding to the excitement, defense industry titan Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) invested $100 million in Terran late last year. Not only does that validate Terran’s technology, but it also served as the basis for a Strategic Cooperation Agreement “SCA” between the two firms, which could lead to more business for Terran in the future as well.Liberty TripAdvisor (LTRPA)image of mobile phone screen displaying tripadvisor logo (TRIP)Source: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.comLiberty TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:LTRPA) is an interesting speculative penny stock. That’s because it has a unique structure. Liberty TripAdvisor is part of famed cable investor John Malone’s Liberty family of companies.You may know Malone for using aggressive amounts of leverage in his holdings to maximize returns. Unfortunately, this sometimes backfires. LTRPA stock is a case in point. Liberty TripAdvisor is a holding company that owns a sizeable chunk of travel website TripAdvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP).Prior to the pandemic, this sort of aggressive bullish bet on TripAdvisor’s future probably made sense. With the downturn in global travel demand, however, TripAdvisor’s value sunk, and the leveraged version of that bet, Liberty TripAdvisor, collapsed from $7 a share to less than a dollar today.Liberty TripAdvisor also had to raise capital at an inopportune time during the crisis which diluted shareholders greatly.Here’s the thing though. TripAdvisor has started to recover. It is strongly profitable once again, and TRIP shares go for just 16 times forward earnings. And revenues are strongly rebounding as well.Will it be enough to save LTRPA stock? It remains to be seen. Liberty TripAdvisor currently has a book value of -$1.87 per share, implying a potentially negative net worth if they liquidated the holding company today. However, it has long-term debt that doesn’t mature anytime soon, giving Liberty TripAdvisor time to recover if TRIP shares regain their prior valuation.Is LTRPA stock going to work out? Only time will tell. But for investors that are confident in a recovery in the global travel market, LTRPA stock could deliver highly levered upside to that theme if things go according to plan.WM Technology (MAPS)APPS stock: A digital illustration of software icons surrounding a cellphone.Source: ShutterstockWM Technology (NASDAQ:MAPS) is a software company focused on the cannabis industry. Its Weedmaps platform offers cannabis retailers a variety of services like ecommerce, compliance and payments.It also serves as a marketplace, allowing cannabis customers to search the platform and compare and contrast different stores’ catalogs in their area.Weedmaps initially saw significant success and has grown to an approximately $200 million per year in revenues business. Lately, it has been more challenging for the company.As cannabis retailers have struggled to make money and face lingering competition from the black market, spending on software solutions in the industry has slowed down. Weedmaps has been rumored to provide some listings to unlicensed operators as well.Still, the trend continues to be toward more new legalized marijuana markets in various U.S. states, which expands the opportunity for WM. In addition, at some point, consolidation in the industry should lead to more stable profits and thus more capital to invest in WM’s software solutions.It remains to be seen whether WM can adapt to the more challenging market conditions in the cannabis industry. However, it has already built a strong revenue base, meanwhile the market capitalization has dipped to $115 million. That leaves plenty of room for upside in MAPS stock if and when the company returns to profitability.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in LMT stock.

These companies are household names with track records of steady growth and operational profitability in some cases over decades. They’ve weathered economic cyclicality and the recessions that come with it, making them particularly timely.We’re exploring those blue-chip stocks that beat the market in 2023. I define that as providing better returns than the average of the 7.35% return from the S&amp;P 500 year-to-date and the 1.05% return from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. So, we’re talking about shares that exceeded 4.2% returns in 2023, also listed here.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsBlue-Chip Stocks: American Express (AXP)the American Express logo etched into woodSource: First Class Photography / Shutterstock.comAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is well-known for providing credit cards catering to more affluent customers. Those same affluent customers tend to be less affected by economic downturns. In turn, it’s logical to guess that the company stands to do better in the difficult environment this year. So far, that has been the case.American Express had a very strong 2022, during which it reached its goal of delivering 25% revenue growth. It did exactly that, reaching $52.86 billion in sales on payments volume that increased by a slightly smaller 21%.The company’s strategy focuses on acquiring more customers and growing that base. American Express established 12.5 million new card accounts in 2022. Investors should expect companywide EPS to increase by 15-17% in 2023. The company has rewarded investors for the strong year by planning to increase its dividend by 15%. American Express’s stable business and customer base give it advantages in this environment, suggesting continued strength.Boeing (BA)It Will Be a Very Long Road to Recovery for BA StockSource: ShutterstockStory continuesBoeing (NYSE:BA) is moving into a new chapter as sales ramp up and problems of the recent past fade. A strong sales trajectory and a backlog of business suggest that Boeing is back. That said, Boeing continues to have operational difficulties that resulted in net losses overall in 2022, a continuation of 2021 results.Boeing’s 2022 sales increased by 7% to $66.61 billion. Boeing suffered a net loss again in 2022 but posted a positive operating cash flow of $3.5 billion, largely due to Q4 results. That led to positive cash flows during the year.BA stock is trending upward in 2023 because the business is now headed in the right direction after major setbacks. Boeing delivered 480 commercial planes and recorded 808 orders overall. With supply chains returning to normal, Boeing should be able to better fulfill that backlog, including a large order of its 787 Dreamliners to Saudi carriers. Thus, it is among the top blue-chip stocks.Disney (DIS)dis stock the Disney logo in red font on a storefrontSource: David Tran Photo / Shutterstock.comDisney (NYSE:DIS) continues to grow at an impressive rate, especially for a firm of its size. Meanwhile, the company is undertaking efforts to reorganize to increase efficiency. Let’s focus on those two aspects of its story to understand why it does well even in a challenging economy.Disney’s fiscal year’s first quarter ends on Dec. 31, which, for most other firms, is the end of the fiscal year. Despite the slight difference, Disney moved into the new year with strong momentum on an 8% increase in sales. That solid growth increased EPS from $0.63 to $0.70 in Q1 year-over-year.Meanwhile, Disney is reorganizing for efficiency as the economy tightens. Structurally, the company has realigned its three core businesses, Entertainment, ESPN, Parks, Products, and Experiences, to be headed separately. The company believes the reorganization will reduce inefficiency leading to $5.5 billion in savings.McDonald’s (MCD)McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.Source: Tama2u / ShutterstockLet’s face it, current headlines about McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) expose the brutal truth of business. Even when business and stock are strong, restructuring will continue to occur. Like Disney, another thriving business, McDonald’s is restructuring and conducting layoffs.McDonald’s began a round of layoffs beginning April 3, targeting hundreds of corporate employees. I can’t speak to their individual performance. They may indeed be less productive. But McDonald’s grew by 12% in Q4 with double-digit growth across all segments. During 2022, company-wide sales increased by 10%. Business is business, but there’s a human toll exacted that broad metrics simply can’t account for.The result of current layoffs is likely to be a boon to MCD stock from the perspective of the markets. It’ll be viewed as leaner and ready for the next growth cycle. McDonald’s has also continued to focus on affordability and a pared-down menu which are arguably strengths currently.Walmart (WMT)Walmart sign on front of Walmart store at sundownSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.comReaders are likely aware that Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is the world’s largest retailer. But the facts about its massive scale provide a bit more perspective for us to understand its relevance. Let’s look at some of those statistics.The world’s largest retailer tallied $572.75 billion in worldwide revenues in 2022 from its 10,953 locations, 4,650 of which are U.S. located. That means that 140 million customers visit Walmart every week.The company has become the largest grocery store in the U.S. as well. That’s probably not surprising to those of you who have visited recently: The grocery section dominates the store. However, what is interesting – at least to me – is that Walmart became the largest U.S. grocer back in 2001.I’m trying to make a simple point: Walmart continues to dominate in 2023 with low-price offerings, especially on staple items. That is a strong reason that its stock continues to perform well.General Electric (GE)Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a buildingSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comThe past is not a prologue. And that’s a positive for General Electric (NYSE:GE) stock which has provided negative annual returns over the last decade. The company had long been in a slow decline, and following years of declining revenues, it was dropped from the DJIA in 2018 as the last original component. 2023 has started very differently for the firm as it outperforms the market.The reason for the strong performance has to do with overarching trends and a military build-up. The firm’s new XA100 military jet engine is shrouded in mystery. Few outside the military have seen the engine, and those that recently did were allowed no recording devices in the room where it was displayed.GE hopes the engines will be fitted to sixth-generation fighter jets used by the U.S. and its allies. Rising tension in the Pacific ensures GE will continue to receive serious attention for the next few years at least. Thus, it is one of the top blue-chip stocks in my book.Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate buildingSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.com2022 was an exceptionally strong year for Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) as favorable market prices resulted in $55.74 billion in earnings. That was more than double the earnings Exxon Mobil reported a year earlier.But it’s difficult to maintain strength and grow quarter after quarter. Like all big oil firms, Exxon Mobil rewards investors willing to experience that volatility with revenues and share buybacks. Its dividend is extremely safe, having last been reduced in 1983. In any case, the point here is that Exxon Mobil, as a company, is adept at manipulating its share price to remain smooth despite volatile commodity markets.So, it does well even when the price of Brent crude trends is lower. However, it might not have to worry as much now about playing defensively. OPEC+ cut production, which suggests that per barrel prices should rise as firms scramble to fill the supply gap. That’s a positive catalyst for XOM stock which has done well over the last three years despite the tumult.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

When OPEC wants the oil price to go up, it cuts supply. And when it’s comfortable putting more supply on the market, then the price of oil will go down accordingly. It’s the simple law of price and demand.So earlier this month, OPEC flexed that muscle and announced cuts by Saudi Arabia of 500,000 barrels a day, Iraq by 211,000 daily barrels. Analysts said the cuts indicate that OPEC wants to keep the oil price north of $90 per barrel.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWill that deter summer travelers in the U.S.? Not likely. Oil companies look to be in excellent shape this spring as the price of oil stays elevated.

(OXY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) isn’t the biggest oil stock out there, with a market capitalization of more than $57 billion.What sets it apart is that it’s much more than an oil stock. It has reserves of natural gas and natural gas liquids that nearly equals its oil holdings. And second, Occidental is positioning itself for continued profitability long after the second quarter is over. It’s working on building out carbon capture technology, including a plant in Texas scheduled to open next year, that will scrub the air of carbon dioxide that’s the equivalent of the emissions of 111,000 vehicles. That technology will be important as companies and nations try to remain carbon-neutral. If Occidental is scrubbing the air of carbon dioxide, it can invest more in fossil fuels.Story continuesEarnings for the fourth quarter included revenue of $8.22 billion, an increase of 3.8% from a year ago. OXY stock is up 7% over the last month and has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Exxon Mobil (XOM)XOM Stock Is on the Way Back, but It Will Take Some TimeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comIf you want one of the big oil stocks to buy, look no further than Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM). With a market cap of $450 billion, Exxon is a multinational oil and gas company looking to get even bigger. The Wall Street Journal reported that Exxon was in preliminary discussion with Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD), which has a market cap of $49 billion. If the deal goes through, it would be the company’s most significant move since Exxon and Mobil merged in 1999.Exxon can afford the deal because it’s been a dominant oil stock. Last year the company brought in $55.7 billion in profits, a company record, thanks to high oil prices. And with OPEC’s recent move, those prices will stay elevated.Exxon’s fourth quarter included revenue of $95.43 billion and earnings per share of $3.40, better than analysts’ expectations. XOM stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.ConocoPhillips (COP)a sign in front of the Conoco Philips office buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) does it all. The company has upstream, midstream and downstream operations. It’s the largest producer of crude oil in Alaska – and an essential resource for the U.S. to reduce its reliance on OPEC’s whims.The company has been in the news lately, as environmental groups are fighting the Biden administration’s decision to allow ConocoPhillips to proceed with its $7 billion Willow project in Alaska. And while other oil companies are passing on Alaska oil, ConocoPhillips is committing to those assets.Earnings in the fourth quarter were strong, with revenue of $19.1 billion, an increase of 23% from a year ago. Environmentalists won’t be happy, but the Willow project will give COP investors something to smile about for the next several years – estimates are Willow will produce 576 million barrels of oil over the next 30 years.COP stock is up 2% over the last month and has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Calumet Specialty Products Partners (CLMT)Production operator communicate between central control room by using radio to operate ball valve at offshore oil and gas processing platform for control gases and liquid crude oil process. Energy Stocks. CEI stockSource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.comWhen looking for oil stocks to buy, you should look beyond the traditional oil and gas producers. Sometimes you can find some exciting names in out-of-the-way places.That brings us to Calumet Specialty Products Partners (NASDAQ:CLMT). Headquartered in Indianapolis, Calumet produces base oils, specialty oils, esters and fuels. It also makes lubricants and greases under the Bel-Ray brand and Royal Purple-branded lubricants, among other products.The company recently completed a $90 million expansion of its oil refinery in Great Falls, Montana, which could allow it to be the biggest producer of sustainable aviation fuel in the U.S. Earnings for the fourth quarter were $999.8 million – and while that narrowly missed the $1 billion mark, it still increased 15.5% from a year ago. Calumet stock is roughly flat this year, but I expect the second quarter to be much improved CLMT stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Shell (SHEL)logo on a gas station in Iceland.Source: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comShell (NYSE:SHEL) is a more traditional oil and gas stock. But you may not be familiar with the ticker because it’s still relatively new. Until last year, Shell was better known as Royal Dutch Shell, but it changed its name and ticker when the company relocated from the Hague to London.Like other names on this list, Shell works with traditional oil and gas and green energy. The company plans to build the largest renewable hydrogen plant in Europe, which is expected to be operational in 2025.Earnings in the fourth quarter were solid, with revenue of $101.3 billion, up 18% from a year ago. And things are also looking rosy for the company’s first-quarter earnings report. Shell announced that it expected its performance in the first three months of 2023 to be “significantly higher” than Q4 2022.The stock jumped on that report, but I won’t be surprised to see another one when the company announces earnings in May.SHEL stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.Chevron (CVX)CVX stockSource: tishomir / Shutterstock.comIt’s hard not to think about Exxon without considering Chevron (NYSE:CVX). While it’s not quite as big as Exxon, it still has a global reach with a huge market cap of more than $300 billion.Chevron enjoyed huge revenues in 2022, bringing in $246 billion, roughly 50% more than a year ago. Profits doubled on a year-over-year basis to $35.5 billion.What I appreciate is that Chevron did a great job of taking care of its shareholders by spreading the wealth. It issued $11 billion in dividends, and it spent another $11.25 billion in share buybacks.Analysts are forecasting Chevron to report revenues of $49.8 billion when it reports earnings at the end of the month and earnings per share of $3.46. Chevron has a pretty consistent history of beating estimates, so I wouldn’t be surprised when it does so again.CVX stock has a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.BP (BP)The BP (BP) logo on a sign against a blue sky with cloudsSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comI’ve already put BP (NYSE:BP) on my list of stocks to buy this month. And there’s nothing I’ve seen in the last few trading cycles would get me to change my mind. Like Chevron, BP had a great year last year, setting a company record for profits of $27.7 billion. Now it’s putting that money to use. It bought a 40% stake in a U.K. carbon capture project from Harbour Energy (OTCMKTS:HBRIY), adding to BP’s impressive effort to reduce carbon emissions.And it will complete its purchase of TravelCenters of America (NYSE:TA) later this year, adding nearly 300 more fuel stations to its footprint in 44 states.BP’s revenue in the fourth quarter was $69.3 billion, an increase of 37% from a year ago. The stock is up 14% this year and has an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier held OXY, XOM, COP, SHEL and BP.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Coca-Cola The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Coca-ColaIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman &amp; CEO, James Robert Quincey, sold US$2.8m worth of shares at a price of US$60.50 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$63.05, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 6.7% of James Robert Quincey's holding.In total, Coca-Cola insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Coca-Cola better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Coca-Cola Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Coca-Cola. In total, Chairman &amp; CEO James Robert Quincey sold US$2.8m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Coca-ColaLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Coca-Cola insiders own 0.7% of the company, worth about US$1.8b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Coca-Cola Tell Us?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that Coca-Cola has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.
