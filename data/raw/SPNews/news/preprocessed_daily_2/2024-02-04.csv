The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. This means that investors who purchase Charles Schwab's shares on or after the 8th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of February."", ""The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.25 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$1.00 per share to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Charles Schwab has a trailing yield of approximately 1.6% on its current stock price of US$62.94. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to investigate whether Charles Schwab can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Charles Schwab ', ""Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Fortunately Charles Schwab's payout ratio is modest, at just 39% of profit. Charles Schwab paid a dividend despite reporting negative free cash flow over the last twelve months. This may be due to heavy investment in the business, but this is still suboptimal from a dividend sustainability perspective."", 'When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.', ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Stocks with flat earnings can still be attractive dividend payers, but it is important to be more conservative with your approach and demand a greater margin for safety when it comes to dividend sustainability. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're not enthused to see that Charles Schwab's earnings per share have remained effectively flat over the past five years. It's better than seeing them drop, certainly, but over the long term, all of the best dividend stocks are able to meaningfully grow their earnings per share."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Charles Schwab has lifted its dividend by approximately 15% a year on average."", 'Is Charles Schwab an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Charles Schwab has seen its earnings per share stagnate in recent years, although the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which could bode well for its future prospects. Charles Schwab ticks a lot of boxes for us from a dividend perspective, and we think these characteristics should mark the company as deserving of further attention.', ""On that note, you'll want to research what risks Charles Schwab is facing. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for Charles Schwab (of which 1 can't be ignored!) you should know about."", ""Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

If you want to skip our overview of the latest trends in the world of AI, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. ', 'When it comes to AI, the rapid rise in prominence of the technology is quite striking. If we rewind the hands of time to mid 2022, then few people would be regularly talking about the technology, and media coverage would be limited to a handful of players such as the firm behind ChatGPT, OpenAI. Yet, in just a year, AI is at the forefront of the media, investor, and even government attention as the advances in decision making offered by data science enable organizations to upscale their operations.', 'Since it led the stock market to rise in 2023, AI is naturally at the front of attention in 2024 as well. The first two months of a year are particularly important for markets as they provide them with the perfect data to set the tone for the rest of the year. These come in the form of earnings reports, and for the Q1 2024 earnings season, all that anyone can talk about is AI. The year started off with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) assuring investors during its earnings call that it was in a stable position to capture any growth in the demand for AI chips. Its CEO C.C.\xa0 Wei shared that TSMC is working with all the major players in the global A.I. industry, as he shared:', 'The surge in AI-related demand in 2023 supports our already strong conviction that the structural demand for energy-efficient computing will accelerate in an intelligent and connected world. TSMC is a key enabler of AI applications. No matter which approach is taken, AI technology is evolving to use more complex AI models, as the amount of computation required for training and influence is increasing. As a result, AI model need to be supported by more powerful semiconductor hardware, which requires use of the most advanced semiconductor process technologies. Thus, the value of TSMC technology position is increasing and we are well-positioned to capture the major portion of the market in terms of semiconductor component in AI.', 'To address unassessable AI-related demand for energy-efficient computing power, customers rely on TSMC to provide the most leading-edge processing technology at scale with a dependable and predictable cadence of technology offering. At the same time, as process technology complexity increased the engagement lead time with customer also started much earlier. There is almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC and we are observing a much higher level of customer interest and engagement at N2 as compared with N3 at a similar stage from both HPC and the smartphone applications. Our 2-nanometer technology will adopt narrow sheet transistor structure and be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficient when it is introduced in 2025.', 'After TSMC, it was Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\'s turn. The world\'s largest chip designer and manufacturer, Intel has struggled to keep up the pace with the industry\'s upgrade cycles and is now aggressively targeting rapid iteration and mass production of advanced semiconductor fabrication process node technologies. Leading the charge is Intel\'s CEO Patrick Gelsinger, who highlighted that not only can AI become an industry that drives a ""$1 trillion semiconductor TAM [TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET] by 2030,"" but also confidently asserted that ""given our foundry and product offerings, we\'re the only company able to participate in 100% of the TAM for AI Silicon logic.""', ""Shifting from the hardware side of the AI industry to the software, the next duo up on the earnings stage came in the form of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). As rapidly changing as AI is, if there's one thing that can be said with certainty about the software segment of artificial intelligence companies and stocks, it's that Alphabet and Microsoft sit right at the top of the global AI food chain that some estimates say has as many as 57,000 companies. Of course, the definition of an 'AI company' depends on whether you also include companies that use AI for their business processes as well as counting others who make the hardware and software. Yet, even if we include the former bunch, Alphabet and Microsoft are still likely to come out on top since their deep expertise in all things data science naturally provides them with a competitive advantage."", 'Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai led with AI and aimed right for the money when he explained during the firm\'s earnings call for the fourth quarter that it is heavily invested in improving Search results with AI. These announcements came even as Google\'s advertisement revenue failed to impress investors and led to a post earnings share price drop. Like Pichai, Microsoft\'s Satya Nadella also talked about AI as he shared that the company had evolved from ""talking about AI"" to ""applying AI to scale.""

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $0.32 total annually to $1.60. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 17% over that duration.

', 'When it comes to AI, the rapid rise in prominence of the technology is quite striking. If we rewind the hands of time to mid 2022, then few people would be regularly talking about the technology, and media coverage would be limited to a handful of players such as the firm behind ChatGPT, OpenAI. Yet, in just a year, AI is at the forefront of the media, investor, and even government attention as the advances in decision making offered by data science enable organizations to upscale their operations.', 'Since it led the stock market to rise in 2023, AI is naturally at the front of attention in 2024 as well. The first two months of a year are particularly important for markets as they provide them with the perfect data to set the tone for the rest of the year. These come in the form of earnings reports, and for the Q1 2024 earnings season, all that anyone can talk about is AI. The year started off with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) assuring investors during its earnings call that it was in a stable position to capture any growth in the demand for AI chips. Its CEO C.C.\xa0 Wei shared that TSMC is working with all the major players in the global A.I. industry, as he shared:', 'The surge in AI-related demand in 2023 supports our already strong conviction that the structural demand for energy-efficient computing will accelerate in an intelligent and connected world. TSMC is a key enabler of AI applications. No matter which approach is taken, AI technology is evolving to use more complex AI models, as the amount of computation required for training and influence is increasing. As a result, AI model need to be supported by more powerful semiconductor hardware, which requires use of the most advanced semiconductor process technologies. Thus, the value of TSMC technology position is increasing and we are well-positioned to capture the major portion of the market in terms of semiconductor component in AI.', 'To address unassessable AI-related demand for energy-efficient computing power, customers rely on TSMC to provide the most leading-edge processing technology at scale with a dependable and predictable cadence of technology offering. At the same time, as process technology complexity increased the engagement lead time with customer also started much earlier. There is almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC and we are observing a much higher level of customer interest and engagement at N2 as compared with N3 at a similar stage from both HPC and the smartphone applications. Our 2-nanometer technology will adopt narrow sheet transistor structure and be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficient when it is introduced in 2025.', 'After TSMC, it was Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\'s turn. The world\'s largest chip designer and manufacturer, Intel has struggled to keep up the pace with the industry\'s upgrade cycles and is now aggressively targeting rapid iteration and mass production of advanced semiconductor fabrication process node technologies. Leading the charge is Intel\'s CEO Patrick Gelsinger, who highlighted that not only can AI become an industry that drives a ""$1 trillion semiconductor TAM [TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET] by 2030,"" but also confidently asserted that ""given our foundry and product offerings, we\'re the only company able to participate in 100% of the TAM for AI Silicon logic.""', ""Shifting from the hardware side of the AI industry to the software, the next duo up on the earnings stage came in the form of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). As rapidly changing as AI is, if there's one thing that can be said with certainty about the software segment of artificial intelligence companies and stocks, it's that Alphabet and Microsoft sit right at the top of the global AI food chain that some estimates say has as many as 57,000 companies. Of course, the definition of an 'AI company' depends on whether you also include companies that use AI for their business processes as well as counting others who make the hardware and software. Yet, even if we include the former bunch, Alphabet and Microsoft are still likely to come out on top since their deep expertise in all things data science naturally provides them with a competitive advantage."", 'Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai led with AI and aimed right for the money when he explained during the firm\'s earnings call for the fourth quarter that it is heavily invested in improving Search results with AI. These announcements came even as Google\'s advertisement revenue failed to impress investors and led to a post earnings share price drop. Like Pichai, Microsoft\'s Satya Nadella also talked about AI as he shared that the company had evolved from ""talking about AI"" to ""applying AI to scale.""

With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)."", ""Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' Check out our latest analysis for MetLife ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for MetLife is:', '5.3% = US$1.6b ÷ US$30b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.05 in profit."", ""Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see MetLife has a lower ROE than the average (13%) in the Insurance industry classification."", ""Unfortunately, that's sub-optimal. That being said, a low ROE is not always a bad thing, especially if the company has low leverage as this still leaves room for improvement if the company were to take on more debt. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for MetLife by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here."", ""Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used."", ""MetLife does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.22. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it."", ""Return on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

Its shares are down 25% from their mid-2022 peak thanks to a combination of higher interest rates and economic lethargy. This weakness has been rekindled just since the beginning of the year."", ""Is this pullback a buying opportunity, now that the dividend yield's a healthy 5.6%? Or is the recent weakness a warning of what's to come? Perhaps it's something in between."", 'A real estate investment trust -- or REIT, for short -- is an organization that holds rent-bearing or revenue-producing properties like apartment buildings, shopping malls, or hotels. REIT stocks like Realty Income are bought and sold like any other kind of stock.', ""But their structure offers shareholders one advantage that stocks of more conventional companies don't. That is, as long as the bulk of a REIT's profits are passed along to shareholders, none of its income is taxed at the corporate level first. The end result is more earnings to share with the REIT's owners."", 'Even by REIT standards, however, Realty Income is unusual for a couple of reasons. First is its focus. The company specializes in retail and consumer-facing properties. Walgreens, Dollar General, and Dollar Tree are its top three tenants, although no single renter accounts for more than 4% of its revenue.', ""Its tenants are also spread out across several different slivers of the retail industry. All told, it owns more than 13,000 different properties (mostly in the United States). This diversification and the company's sheer size act as a buffer against economic turbulence."", ""And the other unique characteristic of Realty Income? Unlike most other stocks and REITs, this one pays its dividends on a monthly, rather than a quarterly, basis. It's done so with incredible reliability too. Indeed, this REIT has not only paid 643 consecutive monthly dividends, but has raised its payout 123 times since its formation in 1994."", ""Better yet -- and unlike some other companies -- Realty Income's operating earnings are still more than fully funding its dividend payments. Credit the fact that the real estate investment trust's occupancy rate consistently holds above 98%. This actually makes sense, however. Its tenants tend to be retailers that plan on sticking around once they go to the expense of setting up a new store or site."", 'It all sounds great, so what went wrong in the middle of 2022?', ""You may recall that that's when the Federal Reserve started pushing interest rates higher, in an effort to curb then-burgeoning inflation. While higher interest rates don't pose a catastrophic threat to Realty Income's business, they can be a headwind. Not only will higher rates increase a REIT's own borrowing costs, they can crimp retailers' demand for new retail space."", 'The retail industry is also already feeling plenty of pressure. Numbers from Coresight Research indicate that more than 4,600 storefronts were shuttered in the U.S. alone last year, reflecting the growing competition of online shopping alternatives, as well as waning demand prompted by continued growth in prices.', ""Investors' worry over this REIT's struggle, though, may be overblown."", ""Take the ongoing growth of its portfolio as an example. As of the end of September 2023, Realty Income owned a little over 262 million square feet worth of real estate spread out across 13,282 different properties. That's up from 11,733 properties and a little less than 226 million square feet at the same point in time in 2022. Yet, Realty Income is no less profitable now than it was then. Clearly, it's finding a way to handle higher financing costs and still continue growing."", ""Underscoring its strength as a landlord is the growth of its rental rates despite economic uncertainty. Same-store rental revenue of $716 million for the three-month stretch ending September is up from the year-earlier comparison of $701 million, suggesting that the REIT's still got plenty of pricing power. Moreover, Realty Income recently upped its full-year 2023 rent growth expectations, again pointing to healthy (if selective) demand for retail space."", ""There's the reason Realty Income is a ticker income-minded investors should view as a buy while it's down and the dividend yield is up. This recent weakness seems to be rooted in far more worry than is merited."", ""Never say never, of course. It's possible interest rates could continue creeping higher, chipping away at Realty Income's bottom line. It's also possible that demand for retail space could crumble as the world increasingly does more of its shopping online, or worse, stops shopping altogether."", ""These worst-case scenarios are looking decreasingly likely, though. Traders are still betting that the Fed is going to cut interest rates at least three more times this year, if not four -- in keeping with the Fed's own view. At the same time, the fourth quarter's initial GDP growth reading was a healthy 3.3%, versus expectations of only 2% growth."", ""The U.S.'s economy is faring better than many seem to think it is, and it's doing better without putting a great deal more upward pressure in inflation. That's an ideal backdrop for all REITs, but particularly REITs like Realty Income that depend so heavily on consumer-facing tenants."", ""Bottom line? If you're on the hunt for reliable dividends from a stock with more upside than downside ahead, Realty Income is certainly one to consider."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Realty Income wasn't one of them.

Nonetheless, many tech stocks are in a growth mode, and a few stocks are likely to stand out.', 'To that end, three Motley Fool contributors offer their takes on companies that could outperform the market as stocks trend higher.', 'Jake Lerch (Alphabet): My pick is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of Google and YouTube. What I really like about Alphabet are its solid fundamentals.', ""Let's start with the top line: revenue. In its most recent quarter (the three months ending on Dec. 31, 2023), Alphabet generated $86.3 billion in revenue. For context, that's about the same amount Walt Disney generates in a year."", 'Moreover, Alphabet is growing that revenue by 13% year over year, the quickest pace for the company dating back to early 2022.', ""Second, it's converting much of that revenue into profits. The company's operating margin -- the portion of revenue converted to operating profit -- stands at 27%. That's above the 10-year average of 25.6%."", 'Lastly, the company is built for the future as a major player in both cloud services and artificial intelligence (AI). ', ""Its cloud services segment, Google Cloud, generated $9.2 billion in revenue in its most recent quarter, up 26% year over year. Better yet, the segment reported an operating profit of $864 million, for a 9% margin. That's important, as the unit hasn't always been profitable."", ""And the company's massive reserves (over $100 billion in cash) mean management can increase shareholder returns by introducing a dividend or by expanding its already enormous $70 billion share-repurchase plan."", ""Alphabet remains a company with giant revenue streams and solid profitability. It has cash to burn that could be used to increase shareholder returns. In short, it's a great stock to consider as the bull market rolls on."", 'Justin Pope (Salesforce): Enterprise software provider Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) has successfully evolved from its customer relationship management roots to become a one-stop shop for almost everything a company could need.', 'Today, the business is doing nearly $34 billion in annual sales, and the stock carries a $275 billion market cap. Yet there is still a clear case for further investment upside.', ""Management has leaned into cutting costs to drive higher operating margins. The company posted 31.2% adjusted operating margins in the third quarter, an improvement of 850 basis points year over year. It's also repurchasing stock, reducing outstanding shares by 2% over the past four quarters, with another $10 billion in authorized repurchases remaining. That means fewer shares to spread profits over, so higher earnings per share and share prices."", 'Continued double-digit revenue growth and a leaner business should juice earnings growth. Analysts believe the company, which ended its fiscal year on Jan. 31, will end that period with $34.8 billion in sales and earn $8.20 per share.', ""Estimates average 11% revenue growth and 17% earnings growth over each of the next two years. The stock is arguably fully valued at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 34, but that's OK for long-term investors buying into a high-quality business like Salesforce. It can catch up to the stock's valuation if it hits analysts' estimates."", ""The recently confirmed bull market is now approximately 16 months old. Historically, bull markets last 42 months on average. Nobody knows how long this bull market will last, but the company's strong earnings growth could propel the stock to new heights if market sentiment remains positive for most of the next couple of years."", 'Will Healy (Airbnb): Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) has driven opportunity and prosperity by linking real estate to technology. Its platform has helped spawn a vibrant short-term rental market, allowing landlords to lease a property to short-term tenants in a way that was almost impossible before its inception.', ""Technically, Expedia's Vrbo invented the concept. But Airbnb has leveraged technology to bring creative differentiation, such as renting spaces by the room and subletting unneeded apartments until a lease expires."", 'And investors might like the fact that AI is one of the technologies driving Airbnb. It has long used the technology to enhance its search tool, profile customers, and determine pricing in a local area.', 'More recently, it deepened its knowledge base in the field by acquiring GamePlanner.AI, allowing Airbnb to add a human touch to its AI tools and interfaces. Applying this technology could reinforce its competitive advantage.', 'Such technologies help Airbnb attract tenants and landlords. In the third quarter of 2023, active listings increased 19% over the previous year. Consequently, more than 113 million nights and experiences were booked during the quarter, a 14% yearly increase.', 'In the first three quarters of 2023, Airbnb earned $7.7 billion in revenue, a 19% increase from year-ago levels. That led to $3.8 billion in free cash flow over the same time frame, 29% more than the same period in 2022.', 'Such growth has attracted increased investor interest, and the stock has risen by nearly 35% over the last year. Despite the increase, the stock trades at 23 times its free cash flow, a reasonable valuation considering the growth Airbnb generates.', ""Ultimately, the marriage of short-term real estate leasing and technology has created a virtuous cycle attracting tenants and landlords, and the application of AI brings these parties together in unique ways, bringing new opportunities. Given the rise of revenue and free cash flow, that improvement should extend the returns of Airbnb's shareholders during the bull market."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

Before making this announcement, Marathon Oil was easily earning enough to cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.', 'Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 21.5% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 10%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.', ""The company's dividend history has been marked by instability, with at least one cut in the last 10 years. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $0.68, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $0.44. This works out to be a decline of approximately 4.3% per year over that time. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. Marathon Oil has impressed us by growing EPS at 29% per year over the past five years. A low payout ratio gives the company a lot of flexibility, and growing earnings also make it very easy for it to grow the dividend."", 'Overall, we like to see the dividend staying consistent, and we think Marathon Oil might even raise payments in the future. Earnings are easily covering distributions, and the company is generating plenty of cash. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.', ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable.

The two most significant sources of revenue for Amazon are its flagship e-commerce platform and its cloud computing platform Amazon Web Services (AWS).', ""In 2023, research firm PYMNTS reported that Amazon accounts for about 48% of all retail spending in the U.S. Compare that to well-known retail giant Walmart, whose business accounts for roughly 7% of U.S. retail spending. In cloud computing, Amazon controls a whopping 32% share of the entire global cloud infrastructure market. That market is valued at around $247 billion annually.

If you want to skip our analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Largest Sovereign Wealth Funds in the World.', ""A sovereign wealth fund (SWF), or a sovereign investment fund is a state-owned investment fund made up of wealth generated by the government. In simple terms, a sovereign wealth fund is a state-owned savings portfolio from which a state invests in various financial and non-financial segments to grow capital and increase wealth. A well-managed sovereign wealth fund plays a vital role in a country's economy and adds to its surplus accounts. Popular sovereign wealth funds have investments in real and financial assets such as real estate, stocks, bonds, precious metals, and various other industries.\xa0"", ""Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy has suffered a massive shock as it continues its way back to recovery. Following the pandemic, things got difficult for State-Owned Investors (SOIs). 2022 was one of the most difficult years for SOIs, especially impacted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine which led to an increase in oil prices and drove inflation rates to new levels in almost four decades. Today, the global economy faces more threats due to geopolitical turmoil including rising tensions in the Middle East. Iran and its proxies are up against Israel and its allies, amidst the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war situation. On February 2, BBC reported that the US has approved plans for strikes on Iranian targets in Iraq and Syria.\xa0"", 'According to Global SWF, the sovereign wealth funds shrank for the first year in 2022. However, the scale of the drop in sovereign wealth funds’ wealth in 2022 is debatable as most SWFs report with significant delays. Still, the SWFs lost around $1 trillion in 2022, as per Global SWF.\xa0', ""Compared to 2022, 2023 was much better for sovereign wealth funds as they increased their spending. On January 1, Reuters reported Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) accumulated approximately a quarter of the $124 billion spent by SWFs worldwide in 2023. Saudi Arabia's SWF is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world. Saudi Arabia generates most of its wealth from the oil economy and has designated a share of its oil wealth to the Public Investment Fund (PIF). The PIF spent a whopping $31.5 billion in 2023 compared to $123.8 billion spent for all sovereign wealth funds. Saudi Arabia is one of the richest Arab countries and the government is working on the diversification of its economy through various investments. PIF is playing a vital role in diversifying the country's economy. The PIF owns four of the biggest football clubs from the Saudi Pro League including Al-Ittihad, Al-Ahli, Al-Nassr, and Al-Hilal. Football clubs from the Saudi Pro League have been able to attract global football stars and icons including Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema, and World Cup winner N’Golo Kante.\xa0"", 'In 2023, one of the major growth drivers for sovereign wealth funds worldwide was a strong rally in global stocks, which helped the SWFs gain a record $11.2 trillion. According to research by the Thinking Ahead Institute, the SWFs account for a record share of 38.9% of total assets among the largest 100 global asset owners.\xa0', 'Norway’s giant sovereign wealth fund has made massive gains in 2023. On January 30, Norges Bank Investment Management reported that Norway Government Pension Fund Global recorded a profit of 2.22 trillion Norwegian kroner, or $213 billion, in 2023. The remarkable gains for Norway Government Pension Fund Global were mainly driven by strong returns on its investments in technology stocks. The CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, Nicolai Tangen, said:', '“Despite high inflation and geopolitical turmoil, the equity market in 2023 was very strong, compared to a weak year in 2022. Technology stocks in particular performed very well.”', 'By the end of 2023, Norway’s SWF had almost 71% investments in equities, 27.1% in fixed income, and 1.9% in unlisted real estate, among others. Norway Government Pension Fund Global has a small stake in about 9,000 companies worldwide including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY), and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KRX:005930), among others. The success of these tech companies is a major reason why Norway Government Pension Fund Global gained massive profits in 2023.\xa0', ""Over the past 12 months, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has given returns of almost 24%, while Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has returned 56%, as of February 2. Apple Inc.

Since then, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) have emerged as two AI leaders, defining the category and its applications. Microsoft is a close partner of OpenAI, and Alphabet quickly revealed its answer to ChatGPT -- Bard -- shortly after ChatGPT was released.', 'Nearly a year after Microsoft unveiled its AI-infused Bing Chat and Alphabet launched Bard, the two companies reported earnings for the October-to-December quarter. Investors sold off both stocks on the news they reported, suggesting that the AI stock boom may be overdone. And yet, both companies delivered solid numbers.', ""Let's dig into each company's recently released report and see which one is the better AI stock to buy today."", ""Microsoft recently took the title of the world's most valuable company from Apple, and the company's earnings show why. To be fair, the enterprise software company closed on its acquisition of Activision Blizzard in October, so its results are getting a modest bump from the quarter a year ago."", ""Microsoft's fiscal 2024 second-quarter revenue rose 18% year over year to $62 billion, which topped analyst estimates at $61.14 billion. Its operating income jumped 33% year over year, or 25% on a non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis. On the bottom line, earnings per share (EPS) also rose 33% year over year, or 26% on a non-GAAP basis, to $2.93. That too came in ahead of estimates."", ""Microsoft's cloud was once again a bright spot for the company as its intelligent cloud segment grew 20% year over year with Azure revenue up 30%. Search and news advertising revenue growth was modest at 8% year over year, indicating that Bing Chat hasn't taken off the way the company hoped."", 'Microsoft finished the after-hours session down 0.3%.', 'Alphabet delivered a solid fiscal 2023 fourth-quarter report overall as the company continues to recover from the slowdown in the digital ad market. Revenue rose 13% year over year to $86.3 billion, ahead of the consensus at $85.3 billion, but ad revenue of $65.5 billion was slightly below expectations, which helped drive the stock price down 6% in after-hours trading.', 'The weaker-than-expected ad-revenue growth seemed to indicate that Alphabet was losing ad-market share to competitors or that AI has yet to have a significant impact on ad spending.', 'On the bottom line, EPS surged from $1.05 to $1.64 due to a $2 billion improvement in equity securities. Operating income rose 30% to $23.7 billion.', 'Ad revenue rose 11% to $65.5 billion in part due to continued weakness in Google Network, where revenue declined again. Google Cloud, its other closely watched business segment, posted 26% growth to $9.2 billion, and it reported operating income of $864 million, up from a loss of $186 million in the quarter a year ago.', 'Both Microsoft and Alphabet saw strong stock-price appreciation last year, and each company reported similar growth on the top and bottom lines in the recent quarter. The difference between the two companies comes down to their AI strategies, and Microsoft appears to have the edge here.', 'The company introduced its AI-powered Copilot into a wide range of products, including the Office 365 suite, Github, Azure, and Bing.

Each of them convincingly outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index last year.

Let\'s take a closer look at all five and see why each could lead the market higher from here.', 'It should come as no surprise that any group of stocks named the AI 5 would include Nvidia. Its H100 data center GPU chip is the leading hardware choice among developers to build, train, and deploy their AI models. In early 2023 HSBC analysts estimated Nvidia had a 90% market share in that segment, and its financial results appeared to back that up.', 'In the recent fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29, 2023), Nvidia generated $18.1 billion in total revenue, which was up a whopping 206% from the year-ago period. Its data center revenue accounted for $14.5 billion of that, which marked an increase of 279%. Those incredible growth rates helped Nvidia stock surge 239% last year, and the upside momentum carried into 2024.', ""Nvidia is now gearing up for the wide release of its new H200 data center chip. When it comes to inferencing -- which involves feeding an AI model real live data so it can make predictions -- the H200 is up to twice as fast as the H100. Plus it consumes 50% less energy, so it's far cheaper to run for operators of centralized data centers."", 'Considering Nvidia is struggling to keep up with demand, the strength in its business will likely continue throughout this calendar year. It certainly deserves its spot in the AI 5.', ""Microsoft is another dominant force in the emerging AI industry, but it's playing to its historical strengths and focusing on the software side. Microsoft invested $10 billion in leading AI start-up OpenAI last year, which is responsible for the popular ChatGPT online chatbot."", ""Microsoft has since used OpenAI's technology to integrate generative AI applications into its entire software suite, including the Windows operating system, 365 document suite, Bing search engine, Edge internet browser, and the Azure cloud platform. Copilot for 365, for example, allows users to rapidly create content in applications like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, which boosts productivity, especially in corporate settings."", ""Azure OpenAI Service, on the other hand, delivers OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models to Azure's cloud customers so they can use the technology to develop AI applications for their own needs."", ""Microsoft recently surpassed Apple to become the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Microsoft, it has a TSR of 310% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.

That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 33%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time.

If you want to skip our overview of the latest trends in the world of AI, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. ', 'When it comes to AI, the rapid rise in prominence of the technology is quite striking. If we rewind the hands of time to mid 2022, then few people would be regularly talking about the technology, and media coverage would be limited to a handful of players such as the firm behind ChatGPT, OpenAI. Yet, in just a year, AI is at the forefront of the media, investor, and even government attention as the advances in decision making offered by data science enable organizations to upscale their operations.', 'Since it led the stock market to rise in 2023, AI is naturally at the front of attention in 2024 as well. The first two months of a year are particularly important for markets as they provide them with the perfect data to set the tone for the rest of the year. These come in the form of earnings reports, and for the Q1 2024 earnings season, all that anyone can talk about is AI. The year started off with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) assuring investors during its earnings call that it was in a stable position to capture any growth in the demand for AI chips. Its CEO C.C.\xa0 Wei shared that TSMC is working with all the major players in the global A.I. industry, as he shared:', 'The surge in AI-related demand in 2023 supports our already strong conviction that the structural demand for energy-efficient computing will accelerate in an intelligent and connected world. TSMC is a key enabler of AI applications. No matter which approach is taken, AI technology is evolving to use more complex AI models, as the amount of computation required for training and influence is increasing. As a result, AI model need to be supported by more powerful semiconductor hardware, which requires use of the most advanced semiconductor process technologies. Thus, the value of TSMC technology position is increasing and we are well-positioned to capture the major portion of the market in terms of semiconductor component in AI.', 'To address unassessable AI-related demand for energy-efficient computing power, customers rely on TSMC to provide the most leading-edge processing technology at scale with a dependable and predictable cadence of technology offering. At the same time, as process technology complexity increased the engagement lead time with customer also started much earlier. There is almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC and we are observing a much higher level of customer interest and engagement at N2 as compared with N3 at a similar stage from both HPC and the smartphone applications. Our 2-nanometer technology will adopt narrow sheet transistor structure and be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficient when it is introduced in 2025.', 'After TSMC, it was Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\'s turn. The world\'s largest chip designer and manufacturer, Intel has struggled to keep up the pace with the industry\'s upgrade cycles and is now aggressively targeting rapid iteration and mass production of advanced semiconductor fabrication process node technologies. Leading the charge is Intel\'s CEO Patrick Gelsinger, who highlighted that not only can AI become an industry that drives a ""$1 trillion semiconductor TAM [TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET] by 2030,"" but also confidently asserted that ""given our foundry and product offerings, we\'re the only company able to participate in 100% of the TAM for AI Silicon logic.""', ""Shifting from the hardware side of the AI industry to the software, the next duo up on the earnings stage came in the form of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). As rapidly changing as AI is, if there's one thing that can be said with certainty about the software segment of artificial intelligence companies and stocks, it's that Alphabet and Microsoft sit right at the top of the global AI food chain that some estimates say has as many as 57,000 companies. Of course, the definition of an 'AI company' depends on whether you also include companies that use AI for their business processes as well as counting others who make the hardware and software. Yet, even if we include the former bunch, Alphabet and Microsoft are still likely to come out on top since their deep expertise in all things data science naturally provides them with a competitive advantage."", 'Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai led with AI and aimed right for the money when he explained during the firm\'s earnings call for the fourth quarter that it is heavily invested in improving Search results with AI. These announcements came even as Google\'s advertisement revenue failed to impress investors and led to a post earnings share price drop. Like Pichai, Microsoft\'s Satya Nadella also talked about AI as he shared that the company had evolved from ""talking about AI"" to ""applying AI to scale.""

However, the US jewelry market faced challenges in 2023, experiencing a decline of 5.8%. This downturn was driven by a number of factors, such as the waning impact of the extraordinary COVID-driven demand witnessed in previous years, consumer fatigue in the jewelry sector, and concerns about the overall economy. The US jewelry market can be broadly categorized into three primary segments. Fine jewelry, made from precious metals such as platinum, gold, and silver, constitutes one category. Fashion jewelry, made from non-precious metals like steel and gold-plated metal, combined with semi-precious stones, forms the second category.

There are rumors that a recently acquired business unit could be on the chopping block, and there could be fewer pharmacy retail locations as well."", 'What should investors expect from the company over the course of the next decade, and would investing in the stock now be a good idea?', ""One of the things that's likely to happen over the next decade is that Walgreens becomes smaller in size. The company has a lot of physical store locations, but that means a higher level of staffing needs and resources. It also comes with more costs and challenges."", ""At a time when companies are looking for leaner, more efficient options (e.g., Starbucks launching more drive-thru-only locations), it would be puzzling if Walgreens didn't consider similar moves. In the past, the company has piloted drone delivery, and that would be a logical growth opportunity for the business to help deliver essentials, including pharmaceuticals, to nearby customers."", 'At the very least, investors should brace for fewer stores. New CEO Tim Wentworth, in a recent interview with Jim Cramer, said the company is closing 200 stores this year but is also looking at locations where it can potentially consolidate stores based on geography. As of Nov. 30, 2023, the company had 8,631 stores in its U.S. retail pharmacy division, down from 8,817 a year earlier.', 'How much lower that number goes is the big question, but a decade from now I would expect a sizable reduction of storefronts for Walgreens, perhaps with some locations converted to smaller sizes that are conducive for delivery and pick-up orders.', ""Given Walgreens' tough financial shape -- it is incurring losses and burning through cash -- I also expect the company will need to divest assets to strengthen its cash position. As of the end of last quarter, Walgreens reported just $784 million in cash and cash equivalents, and it burned through $281 million through just the most recent three-month period."", 'In the past, Walgreens has looked at selling its Boots UK pharmacy chain only to end up keeping it. But under the new CEO, the company looks to be considering a sale once again. To reduce complexity and cash burn in its business, this seems like a probable move for Walgreens as it could generate billions. Walgreens reportedly believes the business could be worth approximately 7 billion pounds ($8.9 billion).', 'Another move Walgreens is reportedly considering is the sale of Shields Health Solutions, a specialty pharmacy business it fully acquired in 2022. It could fetch up to $4 billion for Walgreens, according to reports.', 'If Walgreens can close on these deals, it will not only simplify its business model but will also get an important infusion of cash at a time when it desperately needs it. In order to grow its healthcare business and launch more clinics, plus pay a dividend, Walgreens will need all the cash it can get. The new CEO appears to be tipping his hand that asset sales and reducing the number of stores is the right path for the company.', ""If Walgreens becomes smaller and more efficient, that should help improve cash flow and profitability, which will be key to growing the company's future valuation. Assuming that does happen, Walgreens could make for a good contrarian stock, but it does come with a fair bit of risk as transition strategies don't always play out according to plan. If you're comfortable with that risk and uncertainty, it could be an opportune time to invest in Walgreens as it trades at levels it hasn't been at since the late 2000s."", ""But if you're more risk-averse, you may want to hold off until you see some of these moves come to fruition and for improved results that may suggest the business is on the right track. There's reason to be optimistic that under Wentworth, Walgreens may be on a much better path forward, but it's far too early to declare success just yet."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walgreens Boots Alliance right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walgreens Boots Alliance, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walgreens Boots Alliance wasn't one of them.

(NYSE:LUV) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.18 per share on the 27th of March. This means that the annual payment will be 2.4% of the current stock price, which is in line with the average for the industry.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines ', ""We like to see a healthy dividend yield, but that is only helpful to us if the payment can continue. Prior to this announcement, Southwest Airlines' dividend was making up a very large proportion of earnings, and the company was also not generating any cash flow to offset this. This is a pretty unsustainable practice, and could be risky if continued for the long term."", 'Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 191.5%. Assuming the dividend continues along the course it has been charting recently, our estimates show the payout ratio being 32% which brings it into quite a comfortable range.', ""The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $0.16 total annually to $0.72. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 16% a year over that time. It is great to see strong growth in the dividend payments, but cuts are concerning as it may indicate the payout policy is too ambitious."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to see if earnings per share is growing. Southwest Airlines' EPS has fallen by approximately 28% per year during the past five years. A sharp decline in earnings per share is not great from from a dividend perspective. Even conservative payout ratios can come under pressure if earnings fall far enough. On the bright side, earnings are predicted to gain some ground over the next year, but until this turns into a pattern we wouldn't be feeling too comfortable."", ""Overall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. The payments are bit high to be considered sustainable, and the track record isn't the best. We don't think Southwest Airlines is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus."", ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Meanwhile, despite the importance of dividend payments, they are not the only factors our readers should know when assessing a company. For example, we've picked out 1 warning sign for Southwest Airlines that investors should know about before committing capital to this stock. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

', ""The defense industry, despite all the footage of F-16s firing missiles, is a rather less glamorous sector. Defense companies make all kinds of armaments and combat equipment, both lethal and non-lethal. From Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)'s fourth generation war fighters like the F-16, or Superior Group of Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGC)'s uniforms, each product plays a crucial role in sustaining a war machine regardless of whether there's peace or war."", 'However, when it comes to talking about pure play defense stocks, these are firms that make weapons or provide direct services to the military. From bullets to missiles, defense stocks benefit from having a stable customer in the form of governments. So while firms such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are subject to the whims of their customers, others like The Boeing Company. (NYSE:BA) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) know that not only will they be required to service existing stockpiles, but also that a need to continuously keep themselves abreast of the latest developments in high technology industries such as materials science and aerospace engineering is indispensable.', ""After a brief period of stability following America's withdrawal from Afghanistan, the world was plunged into war once again as Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Since then, not only has the Ukraine invasion endured and seen the Eastern European nation take on one of the biggest militaries in the world, but conflict in the Middle East has also expanded. 2024 ushered in the first U.S. deaths in the Middle East since the attack on Israel."", ""When we talk about defense stocks, one common claim is that as soon as there's a war in which their equipment might be involved (i.e. demand creation), the share prices of defense companies surge. (i.e. investors prepare for growth) For U.S. defense stocks, this claim stood the test of time at the onset of the Russian invasion. As an example, consider the shares of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), two of America's biggest nearly pure play defense stocks."", ""After the Russian invasion began on February 24th, 2022, Lockheed's shares surged by over 19% over the next two weeks before losing all their gains over the course of the next seven months. The stock roared back to life over the course of the next weeks, and since the start of hostilities and since Hamas's attack, the stock is up by 6%."", ""Similarly, Northrop's shares also surged during late February and in October after marking a 4% drop earlier this year in the wake of the company's earnings report. This report, which covered Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)'s earnings for the fourth quarter of and full year 2022 saw the American defense stock's earnings share and sales grow 25% and 16%, respectively. However, the stock fell as Wall Street was not impressed by a 30% net earnings drop for the full year."", 'Even though they might experience some periodic turbulence, American defense stocks are nevertheless at the top of the global food chain. As an illustration, consider our coverage of the Top 20 Most Valuable Defense Companies in the World. Within this list, out of the top five most valuable defense stocks, four were American. Along with Lockheed and Boeing, the top four defense stocks included the Charlotte, Carolina based industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) and missile manufacturer RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).', ""But what about Wall Street? After all, if investment banks and hedge funds are such savvy gurus, then they must possess some uncanny ability to 'sense' when an American defense stock's fortunes will rise. Well, we can see if investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) was thinking ahead as it tinkered with its investment portfolio during the second quarter of 2023. We took a look at Goldman Sachs's defense and aerospace stock portfolio as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs Defense Stocks: Top 10 Stock Picks."", ""For reference, during Q2 2023, the Russian invasion of Ukraine had marked its first anniversary and the Hamas attack was on the horizon. During this period, while Goldman Sachs's top five defense stock picks were all American defense stocks, the bank's favorite defense stock was Lockheed whose jets are so far unmatched globally in stealth technology. RTX (formerly Raytheon) and Boeing were the next two American defense stocks. When we analyze Goldman Sachs's stock portfolio for Q3 2023, we find that the bank trimmed its stake in Lockheed and RTX by 11% and in Boeing by 3%. All these American defense stocks were also present in our coverage of Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023, with Lockheed, RTX, Boeing, and General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) taking the first four places."", ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at the best American defense stocks to buy according to analysts.

In the September-ending quarter, it added 7 million new subscribers, pushing DTC segment revenue for the quarter up 12% year over year to $5 billion, which also benefited from higher pricing.', 'Most importantly, Disney reported a $1 billion improvement in operating loss, which puts its streaming business on track to turn a profit by the end of September, as originally planned.', ""What's more, the company might have further pricing power to grow margins. Disney+ is adding a healthy amount of subscribers even as the plan without ads is $13.99 -- slightly lower than Netflix's $15.49 per month."", ""Even with the cheaper $7.99 ad-supported plan, customers are not balking at paying a higher price than Netflix. The company reported that half of new Disney+ subscribers are opting for the ad-supported plan despite its costing $1 more than Netflix's ad plan."", ""Disney's content is unique and valuable. This shows up in box office numbers, where it had four of the 10 top-grossing films last year. It's also showing up at the theme parks, which are generating significantly higher revenue and profits than before the pandemic. This is why Disney stock is worth buying below $100, but there are still other issues that could limit its gains this year."", ""The weak results at Disney's TV networks (like ABC and ESPN) have been a drag on the company's growth. A weak advertising market sent network revenue down 9% year over year in the September-ending quarter."", ""But the strong growth in the rest of the business means the networks are contributing less to Disney's total revenue, which grew 5% year over year in the September-ending quarter."", ""A bigger problem is the company's debt burden. Disney took on a lot of debt to finance the acquisition of Fox's entertainment assets a few years ago. Long-term debt stood at $46 billion in September, which doesn't look good when the company's profits have deteriorated."", 'While Disney generated almost $10 billion in cash from operations in fiscal 2023 and is sitting on $17 billion of cash and investments to offset the debt, the financial hole makes the stock look more expensive.', ""Adding Disney's net debt to its market cap (share price times total shares outstanding), the stock is trading at 14.6 times the company's fiscal 2019 operating income. This is higher than the stock's average valuation of 12.3 times operating income over the last decade."", ""So even if Disney returned to pre-pandemic levels of profitability, roughly $15 billion in annual operating profit, the stock still doesn't look cheap enough to justify significant upside. But if you're patient, the stock should move higher as management pays down debt, reduces interest expense, and improves the economics of the streaming business."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Walt Disney right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Walt Disney, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Walt Disney wasn't one of them.

27,f22d6687-a0b3-3ff1-b4ed-0cce1ba2bb6c,NOV,2024-02-04,Results: NOV Inc. Exceeded Expectations And The Consensus Has Updated Its Estimates,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/results-nov-inc-exceeded-expectations-131121891.html,1707052281,STORY,['NOV'],"[""It's been a mediocre week for NOV Inc. (NYSE:NOV) shareholders, with the stock dropping 16% to US$17.62 in the week since its latest yearly results. Revenues were US$8.6b, approximately in line with whatthe analysts expected, although statutory earnings per share (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$2.50, an impressive 77% ahead of estimates. This is an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance in its report, look at what experts are forecasting for next year, and see if there has been any change to expectations for the business. We've gathered the most recent statutory forecasts to see whether the analysts have changed their earnings models, following these results."", ' Check out our latest analysis for NOV ', ""Taking into account the latest results, the current consensus from NOV's 17 analysts is for revenues of US$9.17b in 2024. This would reflect a credible 6.9% increase on its revenue over the past 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are forecast to nosedive 41% to US$1.49 in the same period. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$9.26b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$1.72 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become more bearish following the latest results. While there were no changes to revenue forecasts, there was a substantial drop in EPS estimates."", ""It might be a surprise to learn that the consensus price target was broadly unchanged at US$25.17, with the analysts clearly implying that the forecast decline in earnings is not expected to have much of an impact on valuation. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently, the most bullish analyst values NOV at US$33.00 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$19.00. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure."", 'Looking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. One thing stands out from these estimates, which is that NOV is forecast to grow faster in the future than it has in the past, with revenues expected to display 6.9% annualised growth until the end of 2024. If achieved, this would be a much better result than the 2.9% annual decline over the past five years. By contrast, our data suggests that other companies (with analyst coverage) in a similar industry are forecast to see their revenue grow 7.9% per year. So it looks like NOV is expected to grow at about the same rate as the wider industry.', 'The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Happily, there were no real changes to revenue forecasts, with the business still expected to grow in line with the overall industry. The consensus price target held steady at US$25.17, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.', ""Following on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. We have estimates - from multiple NOV analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""That said, it's still necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with NOV , and understanding this should be part of your investment process."", 'Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?

Oil and gas prices were down while interest rates rose. As a result, most energy stocks slumped in 2023.', ""Last year's challenges have many energy stocks trading at compelling levels. Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET), and NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) stand out from the pack as great buys this February. Here's why they could energize your portfolio in 2024 and beyond."", ""Shares of Chevron have slumped about 15% over the past year. While lower oil prices have weighed on the oil giant's stock price, it has also been under pressure due to its bold deal to buy rival Hess. Chevron is paying about $60 billion to acquire Hess, which will enhance its growth while adding some risks. "", ""Hess will add two new areas to Chevron's portfolio (Bakken and offshore Guyana). The Bakken will provide it with another cash flow engine, while Guyana should be a major growth driver. However, there are integration risks with both regions. On top of that, Guyana is in a border dispute with neighboring Venezuela over its lucrative off shore oilfields. "", 'Chevron is no stranger to operating in regions with geopolitical risk. It also has a long track record of integrating acquisitions. As a result, the Hess deal looks like a great move by the oil giant. It could help the company more than double its free cash flow by 2027, assuming oil prices remain in the $70s while extending its production growth outlook into the 2030s. That would give Chevron more cash to increase its already attractive dividend (currently yielding 4.1%) and repurchase its beaten-down shares. ', 'Units of Energy Transfer have actually rallied about 10% over the past year. However, the master limited partnership (MLP) still has lots of room to run. One factor driving that view is its bottom-of-the-barrel valuation: ', ""As that slide shows, Energy Transfer has the second-lowest valuation in its peer group. That's a big reason why it has such a high distribution yield (currently 8.7%)."", ""The MLP trades as if it's not growing, which isn't the case. As that slide also indicates, its earnings are increasing, which is giving it the fuel to continue boosting its big-time distribution. The company recently gave investors another raise and has bumped up its payout by 3.3% over the past year. "", ""Energy Transfer generates ample excess cash after covering that payout. That gives it the funds to invest in expansion projects while maintaining a strong balance sheet. The company's financial strength has enabled it to be a consolidator in the midstream sector (it made two deals last year). Acquisitions and organic expansion should continue growing the MLP's earnings and cash flow, giving it the fuel to steadily increase its high-yielding distribution."", 'NextEra Energy stock has lost about 20% of its value over the past year. That was largely due to issues at its affiliate, NextEra Energy Partners. NextEra Energy had another strong year in 2023, growing its adjusted earnings by more than 9%, which exceeded the high end of its guidance range. With its earnings increasing while its stock slumped, the utility now trades at a much more attractive valuation. It also offers a higher dividend yield (3.2%). ', ""NextEra Energy continues to run circles around its peers in the utility sector. It expects to increase its earnings at or above the high end of its 6% to 8% annual target range through 2026. That's much faster than the roughly 5% to 7% annual growth rate many of its peers hope to achieve. "", ""Two notable catalysts are powering NextEra Energy's faster growth: geography and renewable energy. The company's Florida-based electric utility benefits from the state's above-average population growth and abundant sunshine. Meanwhile, NextEra's energy resources segment is capitalizing on accelerating demand for renewable energy. These factors should enable the utility to continue expanding briskly in the coming years. "", 'Chevron, Energy Transfer, and NextEra Energy are compelling investment opportunities this February. The trio trades at lower valuations, giving them attractive dividend yields. Meanwhile, they have lots of fuel to continue growing their earnings and higher-yielding payouts in the future.

The artificial intelligence (AI) boom of 2023 drove share prices through the roof for some of the leading players in this red-hot sector. Meanwhile, a number of less conspicuous AI stocks were left behind for the benefit of astute AI investors."", ""On that note, these three Motley Fool contributors put their heads together to find some undervalued and nigh-on secret AI stocks for your pleasure and benefit. Read on to see why Atkore (NYSE: ATKR), Sirius XM Holdings\xa0(NASDAQ: SIRI), and Mastercard (NYSE: MA) are the best AI investments you didn't know you were missing."", 'Nicholas Rossolillo (Mastercard): Mastercard, much like its larger peer Visa (NYSE: V), just kicked off 2024 in grand fashion. Its digital payments network acts as a global ""railway"" for money movement. Its data centers, private telecom networks, and cloud-based capabilities help connect banks and financial institutions, merchants, and people in one of the most basic of human communications: transacting business.', ""The volume of currency Mastercard moved on its network in the 2023 fourth quarter was up 10% year over year to $2.4 trillion, which led to a 9% increase in net revenue from its payments network. Add in another 19% increase from the company's ancillary services (like its cybersecurity and analytics solutions), and total revenue to close out 2023 rose 13% year over year to $6.5 billion."", ""And Mastercard developed its own generative AI chatbot for its security and fraud detection services, too. So if you're looking for an AI stock for 2024, it checks that box as well."", 'For the full year 2024, management thinks the global economy will remain in a slower but still healthy growth mode. As a result, the early prediction for full-year revenue is for a low- to mid-teens percentage growth rate over 2023.', ""The real beauty of buying and holding Mastercard stock for the long term, though, is its established railway for money movement, which is incredibly efficient. As with Visa, the addition of new payment volumes does little to increase Mastercard's operating expenses -- which has led to incredible profit-margin increases over time, and steadily increasing free cash flow."", ""Mastercard stock doesn't come cheap, trading for 26 times one-year-forward expected earnings per share (EPS). But it's been a market-obliterating investment over the long term, and one I'm happy to keep holding indefinitely as its tollbooth-style business keeps raking in the cash from facilitating digital payments around the globe."", ""Anders Bylund (Sirius XM): I know what you're thinking: Satellite radio veteran Sirius XM isn't an AI stock. That has been true since the beginning of the high-tech entertainment sector, but it's never too late to change. In last week's fourth-quarter earnings call, Sirius unveiled its first direct bet on AI technologies."", 'When discussing the value that Sirius offers to ad buyers with its large user base and platform-agnostic service, CEO Jennifer Witz dropped this unexpected nugget: ""This year, we will focus on expanding advertising services and investing in capabilities, with many powered by generative AI to enhance monetization and efficiency for marketers. In short, we are confident that our strategy in the advertising business is the right one.""', ""Ad sales have supplied a steady 21% to 22% of Sirius' total sales over the last four years. The company chiefly collects ad revenue through its Pandora online music service, but also on satellite radio channels featuring talk shows and other non-music content."", 'Sirius also offers ad-supported podcasts and an ad-sales platform serving 120 million monthly listeners on third-party audio services.', ""While it's quite all right to deliver an unmovable revenue trend across the economic turbulence of recent years, Sirius would certainly be better off with a growing revenue stream from ad sales."", ""I can't wait to hear more about the company's plans to support its advertising with generative AI. Computer-powered narration could deliver audio versions of text ads, for starters. AI can also assist in scheduling and publishing the right spots in the right channels at the perfect time."", ""Sirius hasn't offered any further details on its AI-based advertising plans, and the company walks a minefield of ethical and technical issues here. But if done right, this effort could elevate advertising from a second-class revenue stream to a leading profit center in a few years."", ""Meanwhile, Sirius investments will soon be easier to manage after management simplifies its complex stock structure to a single class of shares and revamps its board of directors. And it's hard to bet against investing genius Warren Buffett, whose company holds a grand total of $2.2 billion in Sirius' three stock classes today."", ""Lastly, the stock is priced to sell. It moved sideways for five years before dropping as much as 41% in 2023. Investors were spooked by slow car sales, limiting the company's most popular listening experience."", 'But, as fellow Motley Fool Rick Munarriz said when the auto industry started to slow down, Sirius might actually benefit from purported headwinds like rising gas prices. Trading in an old gas-guzzler against a newer and more economical model could put a Sirius-compatible radio in your reach for the first time, after all.', 'So, Sirius XM Holdings is dipping a digital toe into the AI-driven advertising market, and its audio-service prospects look surprisingly strong. This year could be the right time to finally take a bite of this controversial innovator.', 'Billy Duberstein (Atkore): With the hypergrowth of artificial intelligence and the passage of the CHIPS Act, it looks like there will be a lot of semiconductor manufacturing capacity built in the U.S. over the next several years.', ""That's great news for Atkore, a provider of electrical and infrastructure materials, since it supplies the building of a wide swath of nonresidential construction. And what's even better news for investors is that unlike a lot of technology stocks that have run up a lot already, the company trades at a lowly 8.5 times earnings."", ""Why the discount? Revenue and earnings have been declining, which on the surface doesn't look great. But this is because Atkore benefited from the inflation spike in 2021, when it was able to raise prices on its electrical conduit products and mint record revenue and profits. But now that the inflationary picture is coming back down to normal, the company's pricing is coming down as well."", ""That's why revenue fell 4.2% last quarter, with adjusted EPS down 8.9% to $4.12. However, that was with a 16% decline in pricing. Atkore actually increased volume by 13% in the quarter on the back of strong U.S. manufacturing growth."", ""Moreover, Atkore's results beat analyst expectations, and the company actually increased full-year EPS guidance to $17 at the midpoint, up $0.50 from the outlook last quarter."", 'Even better, Atkore continues to repurchase stock at bargain-basement valuations, with another $96 million in share repurchases last quarter. And the company will pay its first-ever dividend of $0.32 on March 15. That annualizes to $1.28, or about a 0.9% yield at these price levels. While not exactly a high dividend yield, that payout seems set to grow handsomely in the future.', ""Look for Atkore's stock to potentially turn higher later this year. That's because the pricing headwind the company has seen over the past two years has almost (though not entirely) run its course. And by the second half of this year, just when the summer construction season heats up, pricing declines should be mostly behind the company."", 'Then, investors will be left with a company growing volumes in the high single digits or low double digits, but with a P/E ratio of 10 or lower.', 'That certainly seems cheap, and it makes Atkore the rare bargain in the AI ecosystem today.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Sirius XM right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Sirius XM, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Sirius XM wasn't one of them.

If you want to skip our coverage of the latest events in the defense sector and the top weapons and firms, then you can take a look at the 5 Best American Defense Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. ', ""The defense industry, despite all the footage of F-16s firing missiles, is a rather less glamorous sector. Defense companies make all kinds of armaments and combat equipment, both lethal and non-lethal. From Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)'s fourth generation war fighters like the F-16, or Superior Group of Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGC)'s uniforms, each product plays a crucial role in sustaining a war machine regardless of whether there's peace or war."", 'However, when it comes to talking about pure play defense stocks, these are firms that make weapons or provide direct services to the military. From bullets to missiles, defense stocks benefit from having a stable customer in the form of governments. So while firms such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are subject to the whims of their customers, others like The Boeing Company. (NYSE:BA) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) know that not only will they be required to service existing stockpiles, but also that a need to continuously keep themselves abreast of the latest developments in high technology industries such as materials science and aerospace engineering is indispensable.', ""After a brief period of stability following America's withdrawal from Afghanistan, the world was plunged into war once again as Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Since then, not only has the Ukraine invasion endured and seen the Eastern European nation take on one of the biggest militaries in the world, but conflict in the Middle East has also expanded. 2024 ushered in the first U.S. deaths in the Middle East since the attack on Israel."", ""When we talk about defense stocks, one common claim is that as soon as there's a war in which their equipment might be involved (i.e. demand creation), the share prices of defense companies surge. (i.e. investors prepare for growth) For U.S. defense stocks, this claim stood the test of time at the onset of the Russian invasion. As an example, consider the shares of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), two of America's biggest nearly pure play defense stocks."", ""After the Russian invasion began on February 24th, 2022, Lockheed's shares surged by over 19% over the next two weeks before losing all their gains over the course of the next seven months. The stock roared back to life over the course of the next weeks, and since the start of hostilities and since Hamas's attack, the stock is up by 6%."", ""Similarly, Northrop's shares also surged during late February and in October after marking a 4% drop earlier this year in the wake of the company's earnings report. This report, which covered Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)'s earnings for the fourth quarter of and full year 2022 saw the American defense stock's earnings share and sales grow 25% and 16%, respectively. However, the stock fell as Wall Street was not impressed by a 30% net earnings drop for the full year."", 'Even though they might experience some periodic turbulence, American defense stocks are nevertheless at the top of the global food chain. As an illustration, consider our coverage of the Top 20 Most Valuable Defense Companies in the World. Within this list, out of the top five most valuable defense stocks, four were American. Along with Lockheed and Boeing, the top four defense stocks included the Charlotte, Carolina based industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) and missile manufacturer RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).', ""But what about Wall Street? After all, if investment banks and hedge funds are such savvy gurus, then they must possess some uncanny ability to 'sense' when an American defense stock's fortunes will rise. Well, we can see if investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) was thinking ahead as it tinkered with its investment portfolio during the second quarter of 2023. We took a look at Goldman Sachs's defense and aerospace stock portfolio as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs Defense Stocks: Top 10 Stock Picks."", ""For reference, during Q2 2023, the Russian invasion of Ukraine had marked its first anniversary and the Hamas attack was on the horizon. During this period, while Goldman Sachs's top five defense stock picks were all American defense stocks, the bank's favorite defense stock was Lockheed whose jets are so far unmatched globally in stealth technology.

These are companies that have increased their payouts for at least 50 consecutive years, which strongly suggests they have resilient businesses and can generate consistent profits and cash flow.', ""Many Dividend Kings are worth investing in, but let's discuss just two today: Abbott Laboratories (NYSE: ABT) and Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). These leaders in healthcare have been rewarding shareholders for decades and should continue to do so for a long time. Here is why."", ""At first glance, Abbott Laboratories doesn't seem to be doing well right now. In 2023, the company's sales declined by 8.1% to about $40.1 billion. Adjusted net earnings per share (EPS) came in at $4.44, down from the $5.34 reported in the previous fiscal year."", ""However, this relatively poor performance can be attributed to the company's coronavirus diagnostics segment. Sales of COVID tests declined substantially last year. Excluding this segment, Abbott's revenue increased by 11.6% year over year organically."", ""More importantly, the company still has multiple growth avenues, so last year's performance doesn't indicate what the future holds. Consider the company's work in diabetes care, most notably with its continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) franchise, the FreeStyle Libre."", 'Once again, it was the star of the show for Abbott last year. Libre sales in 2023 increased by 24% year over year to about $5.3 billion.', 'CEO Robert Ford said the following about the FreeStyle Libre during the company\'s fourth-quarter earnings conference call: ""In terms of sales dollars, Libre has become the most successful medical device in history, and it has outpaced market growth in 13 out of the last 16 quarters.""', 'Yet there is still a massive opportunity remaining in this field. There are more than half a billion diabetes patients (and rising) in the world, of whom only about 1% use CGM technology that enables them to constantly monitor their blood glucose levels, a crucial task for people with diabetes.', ""The lion's share of diabetes patients are from developing countries or emerging markets, and Abbott hasn't launched its FreeStyle Libre in many of those nations yet, so this shows the kind of long-term potential available to the company."", ""And it's just one example. Abbott's track record proves that it is an innovative company with what it takes to navigate the tricky and highly regulated healthcare industry."", 'Its financial results have been up and down in the past few years due to the effects of the pandemic, but the company has generally recorded consistently growing revenue, profits, and cash flow.', 'The Dividend King is currently on its 52nd consecutive year of payout increases. Abbott should continue rewarding its shareholders with regular dividend hikes for a long time.', ""Johnson & Johnson also has its share of problems, especially on the legal front. A new law in the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act, could pose some issues for the company. This and other legal developments affected Johnson & Johnson's performance on the stock market last year."", ""However, the drugmaker's financial results remain pretty strong. In the fiscal year 2023, sales of $85.2 billion increased by 6.5% year over year."", ""Even putting aside the effects of acquisitions and divestitures, the pharma company's sales jumped by 5.9%. Meanwhile, Johnson & Johnson's adjusted EPS came in 11% higher at $9.92."", ""Management shed its consumer health business last year since it had, for a long time, become deadweight on its bottom line. The company's goal is to focus more on its pharmaceutical and medical-device units. Within the former segment, Johnson & Johnson also suffered from declining sales of coronavirus products (specifically, vaccines) last year, but that's a temporary problem."", 'Its pharmaceutical pipeline features 90 ongoing programs that sometimes lead to brand-new approvals. Last year, the company earned the green light for a novel cancer therapy, Talvey, which treats multiple myeloma in patients who have previously undergone four lines of therapy. The company sees peak sales potential of at least $5 billion for this new medicine, and there will be more.', ""The drugmaker also has multiple opportunities within its medical device division, including its Hugo robotic-assisted surgery system. Johnson & Johnson's long-term results look solid despite the abnormality of the pandemic years."", 'Meanwhile, the healthcare giant has raised its dividends for 61 years in a row, a fantastic streak that spans many recessions and countless other headwinds. In short, Johnson & Johnson is an incredibly reliable dividend payer, and that is unlikely to change anytime soon.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Abbott Laboratories right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Abbott Laboratories, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Abbott Laboratories wasn't one of them.

Over the past decade, the stock has risen by 55%, and when including the impact of its dividend, the total return is around 96%."", 'And if not for the disruption COVID caused in the healthcare industry, the stock likely would have been up even more by now. If you hang on to Medtronic for 20-plus years, could this realistically be an investment that can generate $1 million?', ""Medtronic has the potential to be a good growth investment because of the wide reach that its business has. The company's devices help patients with more than 70 types of health conditions. And with a presence in 150 countries, it is in an excellent position to benefit from the healthcare industry's growth in the long run."", ""While this isn't a company that you might expect double-digit growth from these days, it can make for a reliable, slow-growing business that achieves significant growth in the long run."", 'In its most recent quarter, for the period ended Oct. 27, 2023, revenue topped $8 billion and rose by more than 5% compared to the prior-year period. For the full fiscal year (which ends in April), the company is expecting an organic growth rate of around 4.8%.', ""Now that hospital operations are back to normal, there could be more normalcy and growth for Medtronic than there has been in recent years due to COVID. Between that and global supply chain issues, it hasn't been an easy couple of years, which is why investors haven't been all that excited about the stock -- it's down more than 21% in three years. But moving forward, there could be more reason for optimism from investors."", ""For 46 consecutive years, Medtronic has increased its dividend payments. The raises have gotten smaller, with last year's bump being just $0.01, but management has nonetheless kept its streak alive, even amid some challenging macroeconomic conditions."", 'Its payout ratio sits around 89%, which is a bit high. And last quarter, its diluted earnings per share totaled $0.68, less than its quarterly dividend payment of $0.69.', ""There are some valid concerns for investors over whether the dividend might have gotten too high for the streak to continue, which means the ability for Medtronic to be a reliable dividend stock for the next couple of decades is questionable. While I wouldn't expect a cut to be imminent, investors probably shouldn't feel too comfortable in assuming the dividend will continue to grow."", 'For Medtronic to be a millionaire-making investment, you should at least expect it to be able to outperform the market. Otherwise, there would be little reason to buy it, and investors would be better off going with a diversified fund that mirrors the S&P 500 and can be safer in the long run.', ""Medtronic should be able to generate single-digit growth and, combined with its dividend, it could potentially get close to double digits. But I'm not confident that it can outperform the market for multiple decades. Plus, if the dividend is in danger and gets cut, the stock could end up in free fall."", ""If a stock were to grow at the S&P's long-run average of 10% for a period of 20 years, then an investment would increase to nearly seven times its original value. That would mean you would need to invest close to $150,000 to become a millionaire."", ""That's not a practical amount for most investors to put into a single stock, let alone one whose dividend might not be the safest right now, such as Medtronic. Plus, if the stock isn't outperforming the market and its growth rate is lower than the S&P's, you would need to invest even more than $150,000."", ""The company still has growth potential, but investors shouldn't expect this to be a stock that gets them to $1 million."", ""Ultimately, I don't see a strong reason for investing in Medtronic today. The stock isn't terribly expensive, trading at 16 times its estimated future profits, but its growth rate isn't terribly high, its dividend doesn't look all that safe, and there are simply safer and better growth stocks for investors to consider."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Medtronic right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Medtronic, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Medtronic wasn't one of them.

(NYSE:ROK) last week released its latest quarterly, and things did not turn out so great for shareholders. It wasn't a great result overall - while revenue fell marginally short of analyst estimates at US$2.1b, statutory earnings missed forecasts by an incredible 27%, coming in at just US$1.86 per share. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year."", ' View our latest analysis for Rockwell Automation ', ""Following last week's earnings report, Rockwell Automation's 23 analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be US$9.24b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Per-share earnings are expected to increase 9.0% to US$11.54. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$9.35b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$12.13 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become a little more negative on the business after the latest results, given the small dip in their earnings per share numbers for next year."", 'The average price target fell 5.8% to US$291, with reduced earnings forecasts clearly tied to a lower valuation estimate. The consensus price target is just an average of individual analyst targets, so - it could be handy to see how wide the range of underlying estimates is. The most optimistic Rockwell Automation analyst has a price target of US$366 per share, while the most pessimistic values it at US$220. These price targets show that analysts do have some differing views on the business, but the estimates do not vary enough to suggest to us that some are betting on wild success or utter failure.', ""One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that Rockwell Automation's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 1.7% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 6.7% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 7.8% annually. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than Rockwell Automation."", ""The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. Fortunately, the analysts also reconfirmed their revenue estimates, suggesting that it's tracking in line with expectations. Although our data does suggest that Rockwell Automation's revenue is expected to perform worse than the wider industry. Furthermore, the analysts also cut their price targets, suggesting that the latest news has led to greater pessimism about the intrinsic value of the business."", ""With that said, the long-term trajectory of the company's earnings is a lot more important than next year. We have estimates - from multiple Rockwell Automation analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", ""Plus, you should also learn about the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Rockwell Automation ."", 'Have feedback on this article?

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) logged a 1.2% gain last month. The move offers a much-needed glimmer of hope that we'll be able to avoid reentering a bear market."", 'Not every Dow name dished out a gain in January, however. A handful of its 30 stocks lost ground in defiance of the overall trend.', ""Of course, that's not necessarily a problem. Veteran investors know the time to scoop up quality stocks is when they're down for all the wrong reasons. That may be the stance we should be taking now with these three particular tickers."", 'Or ... maybe not.', ""There's no need to belabor the point. The Dow Jones Industrial Average's biggest January losers are 3M (NYSE: MMM), Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), and Boeing (NYSE: BA), down 13.7%, 14.2%, and 19% (respectively)."", ""The funny thing is, none of this weakness comes as a real surprise. In all three cases, last month's losses simply extend or rekindle longer-standing headwinds."", 'Take 3M as an example. Long beleaguered because of its waning competitiveness, 3M has also spent the past few years in a serious legal battle over claims of faulty earplugs. This litigation was brought nearer to its end late last year when it agreed to settle the class action suit for $6 billion.', ""That's roughly a full year's worth of its net income though, and isn't an expense the company can quickly or easily shrug off. Neither the claimants nor the courts have officially agreed yet to accept the offer, either."", ""In the meantime, the bulk of last month's loss for the stock took shape after the release of its fourth-quarter numbers, which laid out tentative plans for navigating its post-settlement existence. 3M's shareholders are worried the intended spinoff of its healthy business could prove costly and complicated. Guidance for sales growth of no more than 2% this year is also less than thrilling."", ""Intel's setback also mostly came in one fell swoop late in the month. Namely, shares plunged following the release of its fourth-quarter numbers and its guidance for the first fiscal quarter now underway. Last quarter's sales of $15.4 billion drove earnings of $0.54 per share."", ""While the top line improved to the tune of 10% and earnings topped expectations, the company's only looking for revenue of between $12.2 billion and $13.2 billion this quarter, which should generate non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) per-share earnings of $0.13. Analysts were expecting an average of $14.2 billion in first-quarter revenue to produce profits of $0.34 per share."", ""As for Boeing, more design problems with its flagship commercial passenger jet are the culprit. In early January, United Airlines and Alaska Airlines both discovered loose bolts with some of their Boeing-made 737 MAX jets, with the latter airline also reporting a panel had blown off one of its same kind of aircraft mid-flight. It's a stark reminder of all the recent design problems the company's faced with this particular plane. At least some airline executives are starting to balk at the once-iconic company's aircraft."", 'Still, are these setbacks ultimately opportunities?', ""The headlines are admittedly ugly. There's a difference between news and noise, however."", ""That's not to say you should simply ignore these recent headlines. Rather, it's simply to suggest taking a step back and putting them in their proper context. The news currently in circulation will eventually be forgotten, but the companies will still be around. What's their long-term prognosis?"", ""For 3M, it isn't great. Although its legal headaches and subsequent costs are a recent and temporary challenge, bear in mind that 3M was struggling well before now. Although there was a time when being a one-stop-shop supplier of everything ranging from automotive care products to dentistry supplies to orange safety cones made sense, technology (and the internet in particular) has democratized these businesses, allowing other manufacturers to penetrate these markets while at the same time allowing customers to find alternatives."", ""3M's revenue growth has been rather anemic since 2012, and operating income growth outright stalled three years later. The company also has bigger problems than costly lawsuits that have yet to be solved."", ""Intel's is a similar story. Once a titan within the tech world, the chipmaker has allowed competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia to cultivate businesses that could have been -- and arguably should have been -- Intel's to dominate; artificial intelligence (AI) tech comes to mind."", ""Then there's the company's struggle to remain the premier name in semiconductor manufacturing. You may recall even before the COVID-19 pandemic that Intel repeatedly postponed the debut date of its first-ever 7-nanometer processors, unable to figure out how to mass-produce these chips at a reliable and cost-effective pace."", ""It's since figured it out (although AMD was mass-producing 7-nanometer silicon well before Intel ever did). But, the company's never quite been the same iconic name it was since suffering that series of shortcomings. Overall economic malaise crimping demand for semiconductors only further weakens the longer-term bullish argument."", ""Here's the thing: Although headwinds are currently blowing, the analyst community still believes Intel's sales growth will accelerate later in the year, and then continue accelerating to a pace of nearly 12% next year. Maybe it's not a buy right now. Intel's a name you might want to put on your watch list for later, though, just to see if it's gearing up for the anticipated sales-growth rebound."", 'As for Boeing, sure, the never-ending revelations of its planes\' design problems are getting old for investors. Ditto for its current and prospective customers. Voicing similar feelings from other airline executives, American Airlines CEO Robert Isom bluntly commented early last month that ""Boeing needs to get [its] act together."" Ouch.', ""There's a curious data nugget buried in the company's recently posted Q4 results, though. That is, Boeing's backlog of orders now stands at $520 billion. That's a multiyear high above 2018's figure, before the 737 MAX started showing evidence of design and fabrication problems -- when airlines were still super-stoked about the plane's potential and promise. Clearly, demand for Boeing's jets remains robust despite well-publicized criticism of the company's oversight."", ""There's a larger lesson to be learned here, of course: While one bad month is worth exploring as a potential buying opportunity, it's not a reason in and of itself to buy a stock.

Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining our call today. 2023 was a very strong year for our company with consistent performance and sustained growth. We executed with discipline across our businesses. We delivered for our customers and patients, our employer clients, our health plan partners in the others we serve. And with our expertise and diverse breadth of capabilities, we continue to improve affordability and clinical outcomes as well as continuing our work to expand access and choice. As we look forward, we're carrying momentum into 2024 and we expect another strong year of performance in growth. Now today, I'll focus my comments on key strategic drivers of our performance last year and how we continue to evolve and advance our business to sustain our impact on growth."", ""Brian will then walk through additional details about our performance for 2023 as well as our outlook for 2024. Then we'll take your questions. Now before I go into our results, I want to comment on the announcement we made earlier this week, we reached a definitive agreement to sell our Medicare businesses to HCSC. We expect this transaction to close in early 2025, following customary legal and regulatory approvals. And while we continue to see the seniors market as an attractive growth market, we concluded that our Medicare businesses well large at about $12 billion in revenue would require sustained investments and focus and capital as well as dedicated resources that were disproportionate with their size within the Cigna Group's portfolio."", ""Additionally, with Evernorth's broad high-performing service portfolio, we will continue to serve the needs of seniors and grow our business. I would note that as part of our agreement, HCSC will be served by Evernorth for continued services for the customers we are selling. Additionally, we're expanding the reach of Evernorth's portfolio and see significant continued growth opportunities in Government services, including Medicare. Now as we consider the performance of our Medicare Advantage business in 2023, in the fourth quarter, results were in line with our expectations. And for the year, we balanced high-quality and competitive benefits offerings, continued target market expansion, and disciplined pricing activity. Now with that, let's move into our 2023 headlines."", ""Probably for 2023, we exceeded our financial commitments. Full year total revenue, we delivered $195.3 billion. Full year adjusted earnings per share was $25.09 and cash flow from operations of $11.8 billion. This performance extends our track record of delivering consistent positive results, in the face of dynamic market conditions. It speaks to the power of our franchise and the purposeful way we've constructed our company, continuing to build on the strength of Cigna Healthcare, while also shaping and expanding our Evernorth Health Services platform to lead the way in addressing evolving needs in the marketplace. As a result of our focus, discipline and sustained execution, over the past decade, we've delivered adjusted EPS growth of more than 13% on an annualized basis."", ""In the five years since our acquisition of Express Scripts, we've achieved or surpassed every goal we established for the combined company. Through 2023, we've grown revenue by over $50 billion and met or exceeded our adjusted EPS objectives each year. And we've returned $27 billion to shareholders through share repurchase as well as attractive dividend payments. In 2023, after increasing our outlook for adjusted EPS twice over the course of the year, we had a strong finish and delivered full year adjusted EPS that was better than expectations. In short, we've demonstrated the ability to profitably evolve our business and services that we provide over many years, which enable us to continue to deliver on our commitments and growth. Now I'll discuss our performance in greater detail."", ""I'll start with Evernorth. In our Express Scripts business, we successfully implemented the single largest contract ever in the pharmacy benefits industry. Throughout 2023, thousands of coworkers collaborated and worked with dedication, so we'd be ready to begin fulfilling, well over 400 million annual prescriptions for 20 million Centene customers starting at the beginning of this year. Additionally, Centene was amongst hundreds of additional clients that were ready to serve in 2024 and I'm proud to say we're off to a strong start. The good work of our team has helped us meet the needs of our customers and reinforce the trust that Centene and of the clients place in our company. Another Evernorth highlight for 2023, is that we once again advanced industry-leading innovation."", ""Last spring, we launched a series of innovations, including ClearCareRx, to support affordability, additional transparency and broader choice as well as independent Rx to partner and enable more closely with independent pharmacies. Then in November, we have further an expanding choice for clients funding their pharmacy benefits with Express Scripts clear network. We were the first to launch a scaled pharmacy network model offering cost-based pricing. In addition, our accelerated growth businesses with Evernorth fueled our momentum as well. Accelerated growth in Accredo specialty pharmacy and CuraScript SD businesses and in our care services businesses contributed to Evernorth's strong top and bottom line results. With Accredo and CuraScript SD, we are supporting patients and providers with safe and effective use of the growing volume of high-cost clinically compliant specialty drugs."", ""We also continue building out our care service platforms to ensure patients can access care when and how they need it, while also remaining connected with physical sense of care. Our MDLIVE virtual platform, for example, is now available to over 60 million individuals as part of their benefits offering and is supporting the growing volume of care, including over 2.2 million virtual visits in 2023. Our results clearly demonstrate that with Evernorth's leading capabilities were valued and flexible partner for health plans, employers, governmental organizations and health care providers. In Cigna Healthcare, we drove revenue and customer growth through disciplined pricing and medical cost management. We serve employers and individuals who trust us to guide them through the health care system."", ""Our leading clinical care programs could use to support our customers and patients, equipping them with the right information and insights they need to make the best choices for their health and vitality. Our ongoing pricing and continued progress in affordability initiatives in 2023 resulting in a medical care ratio that was better than expectations. Our U.S. Commercial Employer business had an outstanding year with continued strong growth. This was driven by our team's continued success in strengthening our competitive position through improved affordability and leveraging our high-performance networks and digitally enabled services as we expand care access, coordination of care and overall value. Our individual exchange business performed broadly in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter."", ""And with the actions we've taken, we are on track to deliver improved profitability in 2024. In international health, we achieved another positive top and bottom line results. Our high-quality and localized health solutions, supported by our global provider network continue to resonate very well with the globally mobile population and employees of multinational corporations as well as intergovernmental organizations. Now turning to 2024. We will sustain our growth in high performance by sharply focusing on the greatest opportunities with a well-balanced portfolio of complementary businesses and a clear durable strategic growth framework. First, we will drive continued steady predictable growth from our high-performing foundational growth businesses."", ""Pharmacy benefit, U.S. commercial employer and our international health business. Our clients depend on our pharmacy services, for example, and our expertise as well as our leadership in lowering cost for prescription drugs and addressing growing needs such as the high demand for the GLP-1 class of drugs for weight loss in diabetes. We have a long history of guiding appropriate access to medications and providing specialized clinical support and we will continue to build on these efforts with new programs such as our EnCircleRx program. We're also supporting customers in additional ways, including by offering enhanced digital tools to help them better understand the value of their pharmacy benefits. We've been successful in growing our U.S. Commercial Employer business for more than a decade and continue to view this as a growth market for the Cigna Group."", ""We continue to leverage the strength in coordinating a growing number of point solutions for our clients and improving clinical outcomes for our clients. Additionally, we continue to act as a disruptive innovator for small and middle-sized client needs. Second, we will build on further momentum for our accelerated growth portfolio, our fast-growing scaled specialty pharmacy business and our care service businesses. We have tremendous opportunities in these large and expanding markets with our differentiated specialty capabilities, supporting patients with high cost and clinically complex treatments. And within Care Services, we're advancing our capabilities in behavioral health, virtual and home care, as well as coordinated care programs for specific conditions."", ""In summary, for 2024, we will grow our customer and revenue base again and our earnings and operating cash flow at the higher end of our long-term strategic targets. We've increased our expectations for full year 2024 adjusted EPS to at least $20.25, we expect our consolidated adjusted revenues to grow at least 20%, and we expect to generate at least $11 billion of operating cash flow. And we will continue to return capital to our shareholders, including a 14% increase in our quarterly dividend. Now before I wrap it up and turn it over to Brian, I also wanted to mention the announcement we made last month about expanding roles for Brian and Eric. Brian has been our Chief Financial Officer for the past three years and will continue in that role."", ""He will also expand his responsibilities as President and CEO of Cigna Healthcare. Eric is expanding his responsibilities as Executive Vice President of Enterprise Strategy for the Cigna Group, while also continuing as President and CEO of Evernorth Services. Brian and Eric's expanded positions, as well as other leadership changes we announced provide further clarity of our priorities and strategy, as well as the extent of reach and impact lucid to have. Importantly, it also reinforces the depth of our management bench. At our Investor Day on March 7 in New York City, you'll hear more from me, Brian and Eric, as well as other key leaders from across our company. We look forward to sharing with you our views of the expanded addressable markets we see and how we've positioned the Cigna Group to advance our next chapters of attractive growth."", ""Now I'll briefly summarize. With the momentum we carried out of 2023, we are raising our guidance for EPS in 2024. We are building on a strong year of disciplined execution, performance and growth across our company. We deliver for our customers and clients and partners. We kept our commitments to our shareholders, including delivering adjusted EPS for 2023 of $25.09, which was above our outlook, and we generated $11.8 billion of cash flow from operations. We have sharpened the focus of our portfolio further to ensure that we are positioned to drive another strong year for our company. We are building on a consistent track record of disciplined execution, innovation and differentiated partnerships. We've increased our outlook for 2024 and now expect EPS of at least $28.25, and we will continue to advance the strategic deployment of capital, including using the majority of our discretionary cash flow for share repurchase in 2024."", ""We'll have another strong year of performance, continue our track record for more than a decade of delivering against our 10% to 13% long-term adjusted EPS growth target, while maintaining an attractive dividend. And with that, I'll turn it over to Brian."", ""Brian Evanko: Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, I'll review the Cigna Group's fourth quarter and full year 2023 results and provide our outlook for full year 2024. We're proud to deliver another strong year for the Cigna Group, reflecting focused execution and growth across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. Looking at full year 2023, some key consolidated financial highlights include revenue of $195.3 billion, adjusted earnings per share of $25.09 and cash flow from operations of $11.8 billion, all well exceeding our initial expectations for the year. Fourth quarter enterprise results were particularly strong with revenue growing 12% to $51.1 billion, after-tax adjusted earnings growing to $2 billion, and adjusted earnings per share growing to $6.79."", ""These results reflect broad-based strength across the company, and this momentum positions us well for growth in 2024. Regarding our growth platforms, I'll first comment on Evernorth. 2023 marked another year of sustained growth and profitability in Evernorth. As our market-leading clinical capabilities and innovative solutions continue to create differentiated value for our health plan, employer and government, clients and customers. Fourth quarter 2023 Evernorth revenues grew 12% to $40.5 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings grew 10% to $1.9 billion, both of which exceeded expectations. Evernorth's results in the quarter were driven by continued strong performance in our specialty pharmacy business, which saw a double-digit year-over-year revenue growth to reach $60 billion in revenues for full year 2023."", ""And our unwavering focus on reducing net costs for our clients as new drug innovations come to market, including GLP-1 agonists, biosimilars, specialty generics and other emerging therapies for clinically complex conditions. The fourth quarter capped a strong 2023 for Evernorth with pre-tax adjusted earnings growing 5% for the year, above expectations. We achieved this even while incurring meaningful spending related to the implementation of our Centene relationship. Evernorth's favorable revenue and adjusted earnings growth in full year 2023, reflected strong execution and expansion across our foundational business, Express Scripts and our scaled accelerated growth business, Accredo specialty pharmacy. Now turning to Cigna Healthcare. We outperformed expectations with full year 2023 pre-tax adjusted earnings growing 9%, reflecting another year of highly effective execution."", 'Fourth quarter 2023 adjusted revenues were $13 billion and pre-tax adjusted earnings were $969 million, representing strong year-over-year growth. The medical care ratio was 82.2%, favorable to expectations. Our medical care ratio favorability was primarily driven by our U.S. Commercial Employer business, particularly within our stop-loss products, which outperformed expectations due to lower cost trends on high dollar claimants. Additionally, we saw lower-than-expected viral costs in the quarter with the combination of flu, COVID and RSV running below projections. As David noted in his comments, we have entered a definitive agreement with HCSC to sell our Medicare businesses. We expect to close this transaction in early 2025, following regulatory approvals.', 'And our full year 2024 outlook assumes full year contributions from our Medicare businesses. For fourth quarter specifically, our Medicare Advantage business generated performance broadly in line with expectations. Across Cigna Healthcare, our full year 2023 medical care ratio was 81.3%, better than expectations, benefiting from our disciplined pricing execution, continued affordability initiatives, and the favorability in our Stop Loss products. The full year MCR of 81.3% was 70 basis points better than the midpoint of our initial 2023 guidance, and is an improvement of 40 basis points from full year 2022. Moving to Cigna Healthcare medical customers. We ended 2023 with 19.8 million total medical customers, growth of approximately 1.8 million or 10% from year-end 2022, ahead of our initial guidance.', ""This growth was driven by U.S. healthcare, primarily from U.S. commercial employer fee-based customers, as well as growth in individual exchange and Medicare Advantage. Cigna Healthcare continues to perform well with strong underlying fundamentals. Our results reflect the strength of our differentiated value proposition and focused execution across the business as well as the stability and consistency of the U.S. commercial employer market. Overall, we're very proud of our strong 2023 results in a disrupted market environment, reflecting the intentional design of the company's growth platforms and our ongoing disciplined execution. This provides us with considerable momentum for 2024 and beyond. Now turning to our outlook for full year 2024, specifically."", 'We continue to expect strong underlying growth in Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. We expect full year 2024 consolidated adjusted revenues of at least $235 billion, and we expect full year 2024 consolidated adjusted income from operations to be at least $8.025 billion or at least $28.25 per share, an increase from our prior outlook. When considering earnings seasonality, we would expect the adjusted earnings per share pattern to be similar to 2023. Now turning to our 2024 outlook for each of our growth platforms. At Evernorth, we expect full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $7 billion. We expect adjusted earnings within Evernorth to ramp as we move throughout the year with first quarter adjusted earnings contributing slightly below 20% of full year Evernorth adjusted earnings.', 'The earnings ramp reflects the effect of early year client-specific onboarding spend. These investments are more concentrated in the first half of the year and taper off over the course of the year. For Cigna Healthcare, we expect full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $4.75 billion. Assumptions in our Cigna Healthcare outlook for 2024 include approximately 19.3 million total medical customers at year-end, and we expect our medical care ratio to be in the range of 81.7% to 82.7%, with the first quarter 2024 medical care ratio expected to be below the low end of the full year guidance range to reflect typical seasonal patterns. Additionally, for the Enterprise, we project an adjusted SG&A ratio of approximately 6.1% for 2024, reflecting a higher proportion of Enterprise revenue from Evernorth, which carries a lower SG&A ratio.', 'And we expect the consolidated adjusted tax rate to be in the range of 20.5% to 21%. Turning to our 2023 capital management position and 2024 capital outlook. We finished 2023 strong and delivered $11.8 billion of cash flow from operations. In 2023, we repurchased 7.8 million shares of common stock for approximately $2.3 billion, and we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders via dividends. Additionally, our debt-to-capital ratio finished the year at 40.1% and an improvement of approximately 100 basis points from year-end 2022. Now, framing our 2024 capital outlook, we expect to deliver at least $11 billion of cash flow from operations through our efficient service-based business model. We expect to deploy approximately $1.5 billion to capital expenditures.', 'And we expect to deploy approximately $1.6 billion to shareholder dividends, reflecting our quarterly dividend of $1.40 per share, a 14% increase on a per share basis In 2024, we intend to use a majority of our discretionary cash flow for share repurchase. As we previously shared, we anticipate to, repurchase at least $5 billion within the first half of 2024. Finally, we expect full year weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of $282 million to 286 million shares. Now to recap, our full year 2023, consolidated results exceeded expectations, reflecting continued focused execution and discipline across Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. And our 2024 outlook reflects continued strength and momentum across our two growth platforms, Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare.', ""We are confident in our ability to deliver full year 2024 adjusted earnings of at least $28.25 per share.

', ""The defense industry, despite all the footage of F-16s firing missiles, is a rather less glamorous sector. Defense companies make all kinds of armaments and combat equipment, both lethal and non-lethal. From Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)'s fourth generation war fighters like the F-16, or Superior Group of Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGC)'s uniforms, each product plays a crucial role in sustaining a war machine regardless of whether there's peace or war."", 'However, when it comes to talking about pure play defense stocks, these are firms that make weapons or provide direct services to the military. From bullets to missiles, defense stocks benefit from having a stable customer in the form of governments. So while firms such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are subject to the whims of their customers, others like The Boeing Company. (NYSE:BA) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) know that not only will they be required to service existing stockpiles, but also that a need to continuously keep themselves abreast of the latest developments in high technology industries such as materials science and aerospace engineering is indispensable.', ""After a brief period of stability following America's withdrawal from Afghanistan, the world was plunged into war once again as Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Since then, not only has the Ukraine invasion endured and seen the Eastern European nation take on one of the biggest militaries in the world, but conflict in the Middle East has also expanded. 2024 ushered in the first U.S. deaths in the Middle East since the attack on Israel."", ""When we talk about defense stocks, one common claim is that as soon as there's a war in which their equipment might be involved (i.e. demand creation), the share prices of defense companies surge. (i.e. investors prepare for growth) For U.S. defense stocks, this claim stood the test of time at the onset of the Russian invasion. As an example, consider the shares of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), two of America's biggest nearly pure play defense stocks."", ""After the Russian invasion began on February 24th, 2022, Lockheed's shares surged by over 19% over the next two weeks before losing all their gains over the course of the next seven months. The stock roared back to life over the course of the next weeks, and since the start of hostilities and since Hamas's attack, the stock is up by 6%."", ""Similarly, Northrop's shares also surged during late February and in October after marking a 4% drop earlier this year in the wake of the company's earnings report. This report, which covered Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)'s earnings for the fourth quarter of and full year 2022 saw the American defense stock's earnings share and sales grow 25% and 16%, respectively. However, the stock fell as Wall Street was not impressed by a 30% net earnings drop for the full year."", 'Even though they might experience some periodic turbulence, American defense stocks are nevertheless at the top of the global food chain. As an illustration, consider our coverage of the Top 20 Most Valuable Defense Companies in the World. Within this list, out of the top five most valuable defense stocks, four were American. Along with Lockheed and Boeing, the top four defense stocks included the Charlotte, Carolina based industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) and missile manufacturer RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).', ""But what about Wall Street? After all, if investment banks and hedge funds are such savvy gurus, then they must possess some uncanny ability to 'sense' when an American defense stock's fortunes will rise. Well, we can see if investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) was thinking ahead as it tinkered with its investment portfolio during the second quarter of 2023. We took a look at Goldman Sachs's defense and aerospace stock portfolio as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs Defense Stocks: Top 10 Stock Picks."", ""For reference, during Q2 2023, the Russian invasion of Ukraine had marked its first anniversary and the Hamas attack was on the horizon. During this period, while Goldman Sachs's top five defense stock picks were all American defense stocks, the bank's favorite defense stock was Lockheed whose jets are so far unmatched globally in stealth technology. RTX (formerly Raytheon) and Boeing were the next two American defense stocks. When we analyze Goldman Sachs's stock portfolio for Q3 2023, we find that the bank trimmed its stake in Lockheed and RTX by 11% and in Boeing by 3%.

However, I believe that pullback represents a golden buying opportunity for three simple reasons.', 'On develops shoes with its proprietary CloudTec technology, which forms interlocking ""cloud"" cushions under a runner\'s feet. These cushions, which were developed by researching the flexibility of garden hoses, stretch when a foot is airborne and contract upon hitting the ground to provide a firmer foundation for the next step.', ""That unique approach, along with the support of famous Swiss athletes like Nicola Spirig and Roger Federer, turned On into Switzerland's top footwear brand and gave it a firm foothold in overseas markets like the U.S. and China. As a result, it's now growing much faster than the market leaders; revenue rose 59% in 2020, 70% in 2021, and 69% in 2022."", 'On expects its revenue to have risen 46% to 1.79 billion Swiss francs (US $2.07 billion) for the full 2023 year -- which would equal a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 61% from 2020. The consensus forecast calls for 28% growth from 2023 to 2025, but UBS analysts believe it could grow at an even higher CAGR of 45% over the next five years.', ""By comparison, analysts expect revenue for giant competitor Nike to grow at a CAGR of 7% from fiscal 2024 (which started last June) and fiscal 2026.

If we rewind the hands of time to mid 2022, then few people would be regularly talking about the technology, and media coverage would be limited to a handful of players such as the firm behind ChatGPT, OpenAI. Yet, in just a year, AI is at the forefront of the media, investor, and even government attention as the advances in decision making offered by data science enable organizations to upscale their operations.', 'Since it led the stock market to rise in 2023, AI is naturally at the front of attention in 2024 as well. The first two months of a year are particularly important for markets as they provide them with the perfect data to set the tone for the rest of the year. These come in the form of earnings reports, and for the Q1 2024 earnings season, all that anyone can talk about is AI. The year started off with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) assuring investors during its earnings call that it was in a stable position to capture any growth in the demand for AI chips. Its CEO C.C.\xa0 Wei shared that TSMC is working with all the major players in the global A.I. industry, as he shared:', 'The surge in AI-related demand in 2023 supports our already strong conviction that the structural demand for energy-efficient computing will accelerate in an intelligent and connected world. TSMC is a key enabler of AI applications. No matter which approach is taken, AI technology is evolving to use more complex AI models, as the amount of computation required for training and influence is increasing. As a result, AI model need to be supported by more powerful semiconductor hardware, which requires use of the most advanced semiconductor process technologies. Thus, the value of TSMC technology position is increasing and we are well-positioned to capture the major portion of the market in terms of semiconductor component in AI.', 'To address unassessable AI-related demand for energy-efficient computing power, customers rely on TSMC to provide the most leading-edge processing technology at scale with a dependable and predictable cadence of technology offering. At the same time, as process technology complexity increased the engagement lead time with customer also started much earlier. There is almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC and we are observing a much higher level of customer interest and engagement at N2 as compared with N3 at a similar stage from both HPC and the smartphone applications. Our 2-nanometer technology will adopt narrow sheet transistor structure and be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficient when it is introduced in 2025.', 'After TSMC, it was Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\'s turn. The world\'s largest chip designer and manufacturer, Intel has struggled to keep up the pace with the industry\'s upgrade cycles and is now aggressively targeting rapid iteration and mass production of advanced semiconductor fabrication process node technologies. Leading the charge is Intel\'s CEO Patrick Gelsinger, who highlighted that not only can AI become an industry that drives a ""$1 trillion semiconductor TAM [TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET] by 2030,"" but also confidently asserted that ""given our foundry and product offerings, we\'re the only company able to participate in 100% of the TAM for AI Silicon logic.""', ""Shifting from the hardware side of the AI industry to the software, the next duo up on the earnings stage came in the form of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc.

Of course, the definition of an 'AI company' depends on whether you also include companies that use AI for their business processes as well as counting others who make the hardware and software. Yet, even if we include the former bunch, Alphabet and Microsoft are still likely to come out on top since their deep expertise in all things data science naturally provides them with a competitive advantage."", 'Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai led with AI and aimed right for the money when he explained during the firm\'s earnings call for the fourth quarter that it is heavily invested in improving Search results with AI.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 States with the Oldest Population in the US. ', 'As recorded by the Population Reference Bureau, it has been forecasted that Americans aged 65 and above will increase from 58 million in 2022 to 82 million by 2050. The share of this age group in the total population will also rise over time. The median age of the nation has also climbed between 1980 and 2022. In 2022, 17 US states recorded a median age above 40 years. The education level in the group is expected to advance and their participation in the labor force has been projected to increase. Some of the best places to retire for active adults and the best retirement communities for them have also been previously covered.', 'Despite the developments, older Americans have been subject to certain challenges. Life expectancy in the US declined significantly during the outbreak of the global pandemic. It has not yet recovered even after improving in 2022. Economic disparity has also been prevalent since the poverty statistics for Latino and African American adults were relatively higher. Medicare expenditures are also expected to rise as the old population in the US grows.', ""Furthermore, the adult population in the United States experiences a burden of chronic diseases. A majority of American adults suffer from one or more chronic conditions. Diabetes, dementia, hypertension, and cancer are some of the costliest chronic illnesses. Obesity, which is also common among older people, tends to increase the chances of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and various cancers. 74% of the US adults tend to be overweight or obese while 96 million adults are pre-diabetic. As reported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, heart disease, cancer, and diabetes substantially add to the country's annual healthcare costs. While a healthy diet and physical activity can limit vulnerability to these diseases, only 54% of adults engage in sufficient aerobic physical activity. Other issues include excessive use of tobacco and alcohol. Many Americans are regularly exposed to first or secondhand smoke. Simultaneously, numerous working-age adults pursue excessive drinking which leads to many deaths every year and reduces the lifespan of those who die by 26 years, on average.\xa0"", ""As mentioned before, the occurrence of chronic diseases is quite common among American adults. Companies that offer treatment options against such diseases include AstraZeneca plc (NYSE:AZN), Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO), and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE). Let's take a look at what these firms have been up to."", 'AstraZeneca plc (NASDAQ:AZN) is a reputable pharmaceutical and biotechnology company. On January 29, the company reported a development regarding the treatment of metastatic HER2-positive solid tumors among adults in the United States. AstraZeneca plc (NASDAQ:AZN) is working with Daiichi Sankyo on Enhertu, a HER2-directed antibody drug conjugate. The supplemental Biologics License Application for Enhertu has been given Priority Review. If it gets approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Enhertu could turn out to be a potential treatment targeting HER2.', 'Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO) is another known global healthcare company. On January 8, Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO)\xa0reported the successful completion of the COMBINE 3 phase 3a trial of once-weekly IcoSema. Icosema has the potential to help those suffering from type 2 diabetes by replacing 28 injections per week with just 1 every week. The COMBINE 3 was a 52-week trial that proved that IceSema was safe and superior to insulin glargine U100 and insulin aspart.', 'Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) manufactures medicines and vaccines that cater to oncology, cardiology, immunology, and neurology. On January 9, Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE)\xa0reported that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Priority Review to the supplemental Biologics License Application for TIVDAK®, a way to treat patients with recurrent and metastatic cervical cancer.

But this month is a special time to do so for one simple reason: There's an extra day for investors to buy stocks because it's a leap year."", ""Three Motley Fool contributors have picked what they believe are fabulous dividend stocks to buy in February. Here's why they chose AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), Novartis (NYSE: NVS), and Pfizer (NYSE: PFE)."", ""Prosper Junior Bakiny (AbbVie): Drugmaker AbbVie was hardly a hot commodity last year. The company lost patent exclusivity in the U.S. for the most important growth driver in its arsenal in the past decade: immunology medicine Humira. AbbVie's revenue dropped as a result."", ""However, this ordeal didn't stop management from raising the company's dividend. AbbVie is currently in its 52nd straight year of payout increases, and despite the Humira-associated sales decline, there are good reasons to be optimistic about the company's future."", ""For one, AbbVie plans to fill the hole left by its former crown jewel with several medicines, including Skyrizi and Rinvoq, a pair of immunology therapies whose indications substantially overlap with those of Humira. The company's pipeline, bolstered by acquisitions, will also help it move on from Humira."", ""It isn't rare for drugmakers to run into patent cliffs for key drugs, and when they do, their sales often decline for a while. Developing newer medicines is the cure for this disease, and that's exactly what AbbVie is doing. The company expects to get back to top-line growth in 2025. And in several more years, Humira's effect on its financial results will completely disappear."", ""In the meantime, given the strength of AbbVie's underlying business and its track record, investors should continue to expect regular dividend increases. The drugmaker offers a competitive yield of 3.76% and a cash payout ratio of 42%."", ""AbbVie is more than capable of boosting its dividends even more, an excellent sign for income-seeking investors. The bottom line: Though AbbVie has had its share of troubles over the past year, it's far too early to give up on this excellent dividend stock."", 'David Jagielski (Novartis): Swiss pharma giant Novartis gives investors a great mix of value, dividends, and growth. The stock yields 3.3%, which is an above-average payout. The company also has an impressive dividend growth streak going back to 1996, which suggests that long-term investors could see their dividend income rise in the future.', 'Novartis is now focused more on growth after spinning off its generics and biosimilars business last year. By having a leaner operation, it can focus more on innovative medicines, which should pave the way to better growth opportunities, higher profits, and potentially higher dividend payments as well. Novartis projects that until 2027, its sales will be able to grow at an average of 5% per year, which is an upgrade over an earlier forecast that called for just 4% annual growth.', 'In 2023, the company had multiple drugs that generated at least 30% revenue growth while bringing in more than $1 billion in sales: Entresto, Kesimpta, and Kisqali. Its top 20 brands brought in just under $35 billion in revenue, and when excluding the impact of foreign exchange, grew at a rate of 12% year over year.', ""Novartis has a promising business, and with the stock trading at just 15 times its estimated future profits, it's a relatively cheap buy as well; the average healthcare stock trades at multiple of 21. For long-term investors, Novartis is an excellent buy today."", 'Keith Speights (Pfizer): At face value, the only thing going for Pfizer these days is its dividend. The big drugmaker\'s dividend yield stands at nearly 6.2%. CFO Dave Denton stated in the recent fourth-quarter conference call that Pfizer\'s first capital allocation priority is ""growing our dividend.""', ""I like Pfizer's dividend -- and so should most income investors. However, I don't think that it's the only good thing going for the company. My view is that Pfizer is arguably one of the most underrated high-yield dividend stocks on the market."", ""Exhibit A in my argument is valuation. Pfizer's shares trade at below 12.2 times expected earnings. That's well below the average forward earnings multiple of 18.7 for the healthcare sector and cheaper than most of its big pharma peers."", ""Exhibit B is Pfizer's growth prospects. Sure, the company's COVID-19 revenue is sinking. And yes, Pfizer faces patent expirations for multiple top-selling drugs over the next few years. But the company also projects roughly $45 billion in new annual revenue by 2030 from new product launches, new indications for existing drugs, and business development deals."", ""I think that Pfizer's new revenue target is realistic. The big drugmaker has already launched several new products with huge commercial potential. Pfizer received the most U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals last year for new drugs in its history. It has also closed on several major acquisitions, notably including Seagen."", 'It could take some time before Pfizer convinces the majority of investors that its future is brighter than the COVID sales and patent losses reflect. In the meantime, though, those who already recognize that the company is underrated can sit back and enjoy those fantastic dividends.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

For instance, medical device specialist Tandem Diabetes Care (NASDAQ: TNDM) encountered economic troubles recently, while fintech leader PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) dealt with slowing revenue growth and a change in leadership that may have spooked investors last year.', 'Both stocks have substantially lagged the market over the past 12 months. Even so, there remain good reasons to invest in PayPal and Tandem Diabetes Care.', ""Tandem Diabetes Care focuses on developing insulin pumps. That is an incredibly important business. The diabetes epidemic now affects more than half a billion people worldwide, according to some estimates. Insulin pumps are a convenient alternative to painful and cumbersome multiple daily injections (MDIs). Many pumps are discreet and easy to conceal. That applies to Tandem's t:slim X2, which is smaller than many competitors without sacrificing the amount of insulin it holds."", ""This gadget also has other perks, including the fact that patients can pair it with continuous glucose monitoring systems to automate the insulin delivery process. However, over the past two years, the somewhat tricky economic environment affected purchases of Tandem's insulin pumps. In the third quarter, the company's pump shipments declined by almost 24% year over year, while its revenue of $185.6 million was 9% lower than the year-ago period."", ""Tandem also remains unprofitable although its net loss per share in the third quarter came in at $0.51, much better than the $0.76 loss it reported in the third quarter of 2022. Still, there is hope for the company. For one, the challenging economy won't disrupt its business forever. And Tandem still sees massive growth potential. For instance, the company does business in 25 countries outside the U.S., where the penetration rate for insulin pumps is typically only between 10% and 20%."", 'That gives Tandem plenty of opportunity for growth. Further, the company earned approval for a brand new product last year, the Mobi system, which is smaller and, just as important, 10% to 15% cheaper to manufacture than the t:slim X2. In other words, greater adoption of its newer device should have a positive impact on the bottom line.', 'While Tandem competes with companies much bigger in this field, it has remained competitive. The medical device specialist estimates that about half of its customers switched from a competitor, while the other half switched from MDIs. Even with the troubles it encountered recently, Tandem should reward patient investors given how important its products are to diabetes patients and its growing installed base. It ended the third quarter with 444,000 patients, an increase of 11% year over year.', ""Its goal is to reach the 1 million mark, creating a massive ecosystem of people constantly buying pump-related supplies and ordering new ones every few years -- a constant stream of revenue that will work wonders for the company's growth, margins, and bottom line. In short, though Tandem Diabetes Care is down, it is far from out."", ""PayPal's business hit all-time highs in 2020 when the COVID-19 pandemic first hit, with its revenue and net new accounts soaring. Things have cooled down since then. In the third quarter of 2023, PayPal's top line grew by 8% year over year to $6.8 billion. Here's what PayPal's revenue growth trends look like over the past three years."", 'Last year, its longtime CEO Dan Schulman stepped down from his role. Schulman had been at the head of PayPal since it split from eBay and became a publicly traded company. Leadership changes can be stressful for investors, but in my view, PayPal will be just fine.', ""First, PayPal's reach remains impressive. For the 12 months ended Sept. 30, the company processed an impressive $1.5 trillion in payment volume. Besides the scale and reach of PayPal's business, here's why that matters. The company arguably benefits from the network effect, so the larger its ecosystem, the more attractive it becomes to merchants and consumers."", 'This is a good sign PayPal can continue growing its number of accounts, payment volume, and revenue for years. On the CEO front, PayPal hired Alex Chriss, a former executive with Intuit, a company that offers financial services to individuals, self-employed workers, and small and medium-sized businesses.', 'Only time will tell whether that was a great choice, but it is worth pointing out that Chriss has a successful track record of leading and managing financial services directed at both consumers and businesses, which is right up PayPal\'s alley. Under his guidance, PayPal continues to improve its business and recently launched half a dozen new artificial intelligence-centered features. They include solutions to the slow checkout process and ""smart receipts"" that help customers predict what else they might want to buy from the same merchants.', ""These innovations are aimed at increasing customer satisfaction and the productivity of merchants, all things that should result in more business for PayPal. Meanwhile, the company still has vast opportunities in the fintech market, an industry with miles of growth left ahead. Given PayPal's competitive edge, name recognition, and improving business, it looks like a top stock to profit from the fintech revolution."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Tandem Diabetes Care right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Tandem Diabetes Care, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Tandem Diabetes Care wasn't one of them.

The thinking is that past winners should keep winning well into the future."", 'In the past five years, PayPal (NASDAQ: PYPL) shares have fallen an eye-opening 34% (as of Jan. 31). This is a huge disappointment, especially when compared to the 111% gain of the Nasdaq Composite Index.', ""Is there any hope that the fintech stock could reverse course, reward investors, and potentially even double in the next five years? Here's what it would take."", 'PayPal is in a special position because it has two powerful tailwinds working in its favor. One is the proliferation of electronic payments, which this business helped pioneer. The other is the continuing penetration of e-commerce relative to in-person shopping. These two trends should support healthy growth for PayPal over the next five years.', ""To be more specific, the business will need to continue increasing the total payment volume (TPV) that its network processes. Despite the stock's performance, growing TPV hasn't been an issue, as it has soared from $143 billion in the third quarter of 2018 to $388 billion in Q3 2023. There's no reason to believe this can't continue for the foreseeable future."", ""That's because PayPal is the most widely accepted digital wallet among the top 1,500 retailers in North America and Europe. Being ubiquitous as a checkout option helps drive payment activity."", 'Moreover, because PayPal has both merchants and individual consumers as its customers, it is able to collect valuable data from both sides of a transaction. The result is both better authorization rates and improved fraud detection.', ""Speaking more to PayPal's two-sided platform, the company has a strong competitive position thanks to its network effect. With more merchants and more consumers, PayPal has become increasingly valuable to all stakeholders. This helps to keep existing rivals and new entrants at bay."", ""A platform like PayPal needs to start benefiting from operating leverage. Payments is typically an extremely scalable business model that should see expanding margins over time, so it can be discouraging to know that PayPal's operating margin in the most recent quarter of 15.7% is lower than the year-ago period."", 'I think that for the stock to double over the next five years, earnings will have to rise at a faster rate than the top line. There are some reasons to be optimistic about this scenario.', 'Alex Chriss, the new chief executive officer, has already made moves that support his comments about driving greater efficiencies across the organization. PayPal recently laid off 9% of its workforce after laying off 2,000 employees last year. This should help to eliminate unnecessary bloat that PayPal might have added over the past few years.', ""Another factor that could help the bottom line is management's increased focus on boosting engagement from existing users. The strategy can require much less marketing spend, which can help profitability."", ""Shareholders can also appreciate PayPal's friendly capital allocation policy. It had expected to spend $5 billion to repurchase stock in 2023, an activity that can increase earnings per share."", ""Besides strong revenue growth and an expanding bottom line, there's another key ingredient necessary for shares to double in the next five years. And that is a higher valuation multiple."", ""It's not surprising that, based on the stock's poor performance in the past few years, it trades at a ridiculously cheap forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 11.1. This proves that expectations for PayPal are extremely low right now."", ""Should the business start producing results in line with what I discussed, namely strong revenue growth and an expanding bottom line, there's a very good chance the valuation will be higher in five years, potentially setting the stock up to double."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in PayPal right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PayPal, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PayPal wasn't one of them.

Nothing can stop it. ThinkAdvisor.com interviewed investment strategist Harry Dent Jr. about the 2024 market outlook. Dent argued that the S&P 500 could lose 86% of its value in 2024.', 'However, try not to take the doom and gloom too seriously. He also suggested that January would foretell the pain ahead.\xa0Well, Nvidia’s up 28% this month, while the index has gained over 3%, a respectable number given its convincing performance in 2023. Is it too late to buy NVDA stock? I’ll look at both sides of the argument.', 'Well, it is if you listen to Harry Dent. He believes the apocalypse will soon be upon us. In Dent’s defense, I saw a chart recently (I’ll be damned if I could remember where) that made a convincing case that stocks were ready for a bit of a shakeup.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'On Jan. 24, Nvidia’s market cap hit $1.5 trillion for the first time. It hit $1 trillion in May 2023. With 2.47 billion shares outstanding, it can get to $2 trillion with another 33% gain. If successful, that would be a 631% gain from its October 2022 low of around $112.', 'Based on the analyst EPS estimate for 2024 of $11.07 a share, it’s currently trading at 56x earnings. Its five-year average forward P/E is 42, so there’s no question it’s not a cheap buy right now. However, with 49 of 53 analysts rating it Overweight or Buy, anything’s possible.', 'InvestorPlace’s Josh Enomoto declared in early November that Nvidia had a high price-to-earnings ratio relative to its AI and machine learning peers. Further, he suggested NVDA stock was more expensive than 90% of its tech peers. As a result, he was near-term bearish on the stock.', 'I don’t think there’s any doubt that Nvidia has to hit its ambitious growth targets. The average analyst estimate for revenue growth in 2024 is 119% and 58% in 2025, with 2024 and 2025 EPS of $3.34 and $12.31, respectively, for its share price to keep moving higher.', 'That’s not a slam dunk.', 'In July 2017, I wrote about why the perception Nvidia’s stock was expensive at the time — it traded at 55x its trailing earnings and 14x sales — wasn’t entirely accurate. I used McCormick & Company’s (NYSE:MKC) acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser’s (OTCMKTS:RBGLY) French’s and Frank’s Hot Sauce brands to illustrate why value is relative.', '“Nvidia’s fiscal 2017 free cash flow was $1.5 billion, or 22% of its annual revenue. McCormick’s free cash flow was $658 million or 15% of its annual revenue,” I wrote in 2017.', '“If McCormick is willing to pay seven times sales for a business that likely doesn’t generate free cash flow equal to or greater than 15% of its annual revenue, Nvidia shareholders paying 14 times sales is the price you pay to own a business that generates 50% more free cash flow relative to annual revenue.”', 'The most impressive part of that quote concerns free cash flow. In fiscal 2017, it was $1.5 billion. Bank of America recently highlighted that Nvidia should be able to generate $100 billion in free cash flow over the next two years, more than 3x what it generated over the past two and 56x what it did seven years ago.', '“Of the ~$100 billion [of] free cash flow, we estimate only ~$30 to $35 billion could be deployed for buybacks, leaving a meaningful $65 to $70 billion in ammunition for new organic and inorganic growth initiatives,” Business Insider reported BofA analyst Vivek Arya’s comments from a Jan. 4 note to clients.', 'While there’s no question we are in the early innings of AI, and the leadership positions could change over time, I don’t think there’s any doubt that it’s Nvidia’s game to lose.', 'Until someone can show they’re up to the challenge of toppling the company from the top of the AI mountain, its stock seems destined to keep moving higher.', 'I believe it’s still a buy.', 'However, pick up half a position now, and the other half should it correct into the low $500s or high $400s.', 'On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our overview of the latest trends in the world of AI, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. ', 'When it comes to AI, the rapid rise in prominence of the technology is quite striking. If we rewind the hands of time to mid 2022, then few people would be regularly talking about the technology, and media coverage would be limited to a handful of players such as the firm behind ChatGPT, OpenAI. Yet, in just a year, AI is at the forefront of the media, investor, and even government attention as the advances in decision making offered by data science enable organizations to upscale their operations.', 'Since it led the stock market to rise in 2023, AI is naturally at the front of attention in 2024 as well. The first two months of a year are particularly important for markets as they provide them with the perfect data to set the tone for the rest of the year. These come in the form of earnings reports, and for the Q1 2024 earnings season, all that anyone can talk about is AI. The year started off with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) assuring investors during its earnings call that it was in a stable position to capture any growth in the demand for AI chips. Its CEO C.C.\xa0 Wei shared that TSMC is working with all the major players in the global A.I. industry, as he shared:', 'The surge in AI-related demand in 2023 supports our already strong conviction that the structural demand for energy-efficient computing will accelerate in an intelligent and connected world. TSMC is a key enabler of AI applications. No matter which approach is taken, AI technology is evolving to use more complex AI models, as the amount of computation required for training and influence is increasing. As a result, AI model need to be supported by more powerful semiconductor hardware, which requires use of the most advanced semiconductor process technologies. Thus, the value of TSMC technology position is increasing and we are well-positioned to capture the major portion of the market in terms of semiconductor component in AI.', 'To address unassessable AI-related demand for energy-efficient computing power, customers rely on TSMC to provide the most leading-edge processing technology at scale with a dependable and predictable cadence of technology offering. At the same time, as process technology complexity increased the engagement lead time with customer also started much earlier. There is almost all the AI innovators are working with TSMC and we are observing a much higher level of customer interest and engagement at N2 as compared with N3 at a similar stage from both HPC and the smartphone applications. Our 2-nanometer technology will adopt narrow sheet transistor structure and be the most advanced semiconductor technology in the industry in both density and energy efficient when it is introduced in 2025.', 'After TSMC, it was Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\'s turn. The world\'s largest chip designer and manufacturer, Intel has struggled to keep up the pace with the industry\'s upgrade cycles and is now aggressively targeting rapid iteration and mass production of advanced semiconductor fabrication process node technologies. Leading the charge is Intel\'s CEO Patrick Gelsinger, who highlighted that not only can AI become an industry that drives a ""$1 trillion semiconductor TAM [TOTAL ADDRESSABLE MARKET] by 2030,"" but also confidently asserted that ""given our foundry and product offerings, we\'re the only company able to participate in 100% of the TAM for AI Silicon logic.""', ""Shifting from the hardware side of the AI industry to the software, the next duo up on the earnings stage came in the form of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). As rapidly changing as AI is, if there's one thing that can be said with certainty about the software segment of artificial intelligence companies and stocks, it's that Alphabet and Microsoft sit right at the top of the global AI food chain that some estimates say has as many as 57,000 companies. Of course, the definition of an 'AI company' depends on whether you also include companies that use AI for their business processes as well as counting others who make the hardware and software. Yet, even if we include the former bunch, Alphabet and Microsoft are still likely to come out on top since their deep expertise in all things data science naturally provides them with a competitive advantage."", 'Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai led with AI and aimed right for the money when he explained during the firm\'s earnings call for the fourth quarter that it is heavily invested in improving Search results with AI. These announcements came even as Google\'s advertisement revenue failed to impress investors and led to a post earnings share price drop. Like Pichai, Microsoft\'s Satya Nadella also talked about AI as he shared that the company had evolved from ""talking about AI"" to ""applying AI to scale."" ', 'So, as AI continues to remain the topic in technology and finance, we decided to see what AI stocks analysts believe are worth watching out for. Some top picks are The Trade Desk, Inc.

Digital payments leader Visa (NYSE: V) just had yet another solid earnings report. After reporting a 9% increase in total payments volume in fiscal 2023 (for Visa, the 12-month period that ended in September 2023), it kicked off fiscal 2024 (its first quarter ended in December 2023) with another 8% year-over-year increase in payments volume. Not bad for a ""recession-like"" economy in the last year or so.', ""There remain some persistent calls for slowing economic growth, with some economists remaining stubborn in their call for a recession, in 2024. But Visa thinks all is well. It's predicting stable growth in its global payment volume that could lead to high-single-digit to low-teens percentage growth in revenue."", 'If you\'re looking for a quick and easy way to invest in the ""new bull market,"" Visa stock could be your ticket in 2024.', 'Visa operates four of its own data centers and a dedicated global telecom network to process tens of billions of transactions every quarter (57.5 billion last quarter). Its core business is simple: It acts as a toll booth, taking a percentage cut of transactions that use its network. It also acts as the connective tissue between various banks and financial institutions, merchants, and purchasers, making it a type of sprawling communications enterprise (with the ""communication"" in this instance being details regarding a transaction and the parties involved in it).', 'However, as the world goes increasingly digital, Visa has been expanding its services to accommodate other financial networks too -- its ""network of networks"" strategy. Whether it\'s traditional card-based digital payments or newer cloud computing-based ones, Visa aims to facilitate them as a type of railway of global money movement. It has numerous add-on services like data security and analytics, business payment management solutions, and cloud-based integrations for upstart fintechs.', ""With such a sprawling enterprise based on a foundational capability like movement of money, Visa is thus a solid barometer of global economic health. As digital technology continues to expand the options available to move money and transact business around the world, Visa's revenue will be able to outpace average annual low-single-digit percentage economic growth -- much as it has since its debut as a publicly traded company in 2008."", 'Of course, revenue growth is no reason to invest in a company. The amount of profit a company is able to capture is of far more importance. In this department, Visa excels. In first-quarter fiscal 2024, earnings per share increased 20% year over year (or up 11% on an adjusted basis).', 'Visa can accomplish this feat with that efficient global network of data centers, telecom infrastructure, and cloud-based solutions. Once built, these assets have the ability to facilitate a seemingly near-infinite amount of transaction volume, with each new increase in transactions adding very little in the way of new expenses for Visa.', 'Along the way, it doles out plenty of excess cash to shareholders with dividend increases and stock buybacks.', 'Shares do trade for a premium (30 times trailing 12-month earnings, or about 25 times one-year forward expected earnings), as has been the persistent norm for the duration of its existence as a publicly traded stock.

Higher rates increased their borrowing costs and made lower-risk alternative investments like bonds and bank CDs more attractive, which caused dividend yields to rise to compensate investors for their higher risk profiles.', 'However, that headwind should fade in 2024. Because of that and some company-specific factors, dividend yields could compress this year as share prices rise.', ""That makes now the time to buy high-quality, high-yielding dividend stocks before their yields fall from their more attractive levels. Stanley Black & Decker (NYSE: SWK), Enbridge (NYSE: ENB), and Clearway Energy (NYSE: CWEN)(NYSE: CWEN.A) currently stand out to these three Motley Fool contributors as higher-yielding dividend stocks that income-focused investors will want to scoop up before it's too late."", ""Reuben Gregg Brewer (Stanley Black & Decker): The last couple of years have been really bad for this Dividend King. Adjusted earnings hit a record in 2021 of $10.48 per share. In 2022, Stanley earned less than half of that at $4.62.

But management has been hard at work streamlining the business, by increasing efficiency, paying down debt, and raising prices, among other things."", 'Success in its efforts has come in many forms, but one of the most notable is that adjusted gross margins have now increased for four consecutive quarters.', 'Meanwhile, when Stanley Black & Decker released its fourth-quarter earnings, it provided adjusted earnings guidance for 2024. At this point, management is expecting the figure to fall to between $3.50 and $4.50 per share. After a few bad years on the earnings front, it looks like Stanley could finally be in for a good one.', 'If the company can actually turn the earnings trend higher again, Wall Street is likely to materially alter its view of the stock. The 3.4% dividend yield offered today remains near historically high levels, but perhaps not for long.', ""Matt DiLallo (Enbridge): Shares of Enbridge have shed more than 10% of their value over the past year. That has pushed the Canadian infrastructure company's dividend yield up to 7.5%. "", ""Two factors have weighed on the company: interest rates and a massive acquisition. Higher interest rates have increased the borrowing costs of companies like Enbridge while weighing on the valuations of higher-yielding dividend stocks. On top of that, Enbridge agreed to buy three natural gas utilities from Dominion Energy in a $14 billion transaction. That's a sizable acquisition, which adds some risk. "", ""These headwinds could turn into tailwinds in 2024. The Federal Reserve has said it will begin cutting interest rates in 2024, which should reduce Enbridge's borrowing costs while lifting some of the weight off its stock price. "", ""Meanwhile, Enbridge sees the Dominion deal as a once-in-a-generation opportunity to acquire three high-quality natural gas utilities at a historically attractive valuation. That deal will also significantly enhance the company's cash flow and growth profile. "", 'Besides that deal, Enbridge should continue benefiting from its massive organic growth backlog. After closing the Dominion deals, the company will have over 24 billion Canadian dollars ($17.9 billion) of expansion projects in its backlog. ', 'And it has many more projects under development. Enbridge believes it can grow its earnings about 5% annually over the medium term. That should give it the power to continue pushing its high-yielding payout higher.

It offers a high yield of 6.4% and aims to increase its dividend by 7% this year, in line with its long-term target range of 5% to 8% in divided growth through 2026. Even better, Clearway Energy is confident of supporting its dividend growth through cash flows without resorting to debt or stock sales.', 'Clearway Energy sells power it produces under long-term contracts and therefore generates steady cash flows, which is the primary reason it can afford to pay regular dividends.', 'The company also has manageable debt and is consistently investing in growth projects to generate higher cash available for distribution (CAFD) and support bigger dividends. Last quarter, for instance, Clearway Energy reiterated its 2023 CAFD guidance of $330 million to $360 million while projecting CAFD of $395 million for 2024. The sale of its thermal business in 2022, in particular, left the company with a lot of cash to deploy into new growth with high CAFD yields.', ""Since it increases dividends quarterly, you can expect this year's first dividend raise from the stock in the coming weeks close to the fourth-quarter earnings release on Feb. 22.

Most of the world's top AI companies -- including Microsoft, ChatGPT's creator OpenAI, and Amazon -- currently use its high-end GPUs to process complex AI tasks. That market is growing rapidly as more organizations harness the power of generative AI tools to predictively generate fresh content instead of simply crunching large amounts of data."", ""That's why analysts expect Nvidia's revenue and adjusted earnings to soar 119% and 268%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 (which ended this January). They expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to grow another 58% and 69%, respectively, in fiscal 2025 as the AI market continues to expand. Those growth rates are remarkable, but Nvidia's stock isn't exactly a screaming bargain at 30 times forward earnings and 16 times next year's sales."", 'Therefore, investors who want some exposure to the AI market at lower valuations might consider buying three stocks -- Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) -- instead of Nvidia.', ""Super Micro Computer, more commonly known as Supermicro, produces high-performance servers. It controls a much smaller slice of the global server market than Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Dell Technologies, but it's carved out a high-growth niche with its dedicated AI servers."", ""Supermicro's long-standing partnership with Nvidia grants it access to the chipmaker's top-tier data center GPUs before its larger competitors. As a result, its sales of pre-built AI servers skyrocketed as the AI market expanded."", ""Supermicro's revenue surged 46% in fiscal 2022 (which ended in June 2022) and rose 37% in fiscal 2023, and analysts expect an acceleration to 103% growth in fiscal 2024. Its adjusted EPS more than doubled in both fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2023, and analysts anticipate 70% growth in fiscal 2024. But at $535 per share, Supermicro trades at just 27 times this year's earnings."", ""Supermicro might seem pricier than HPE and Dell, but it's not a slow-growth server company. Instead, it's an AI company that is tightly tethered to Nvidia and should keep growing as long as the market is starved for Nvidia-powered AI servers."", 'Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, more commonly known as TSMC, is the world\'s largest and most technologically advanced contract chipmaker. It manufactures chips for a long list of ""fabless"" chipmakers, including Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, Apple, and Qualcomm.', ""Nvidia designs its own GPUs, but it outsources the production to TSMC's foundries, which are capable of manufacturing the world's smallest, densest, and most power-efficient chips. AMD, which is trying to catch up to Nvidia with its own data center GPUs, also outsources the production of those chips to TSMC. OpenAI has even reportedly been holding talks with TSMC to form a joint venture to manufacture its own AI chips."", 'Simply put, TSMC is a linchpin of the global semiconductor and AI markets. But its growth is also cyclical. In 2023, TSMC\'s revenue and earnings fell 9% and 21%, respectively, in USD terms as the smartphone and PC markets cooled off. But in 2024 the company expects its revenue to rise by more than 20% as those markets recover, it ramps up its production of its latest 3nm chips, and profits from the ""robust"" growth of the AI market.', ""Analysts expect TSMC's revenue and earnings to grow 23% and 10%, respectively, this year. However, its stock trades at just 18 times forward earnings -- which makes it a cheaper way to profit from the expansion of the AI market than Nvidia."", ""Alphabet's Google owns the world's largest search engine and online advertising business, and the third-largest cloud infrastructure platform. Its sprawling ecosystem also includes the world's most popular streaming video platform (YouTube), top mobile operating system (Android), and leading webmail service (Gmail)."", ""Google ties together all of those services with its own AI algorithms, and it's been expanding into the generative AI market with its Bard chatbot and Gemini large language models. It's already one of the world's largest buyers of Nvidia's data center GPUs, and it's been developing its own AI accelerators to gradually reduce its dependence on those chips."", ""Alphabet's revenue only rose 9% in 2023 as Google's advertising business struggled with tough macro headwinds throughout the first half of the year. However, its growth accelerated again in the second half as its cloud platform -- which it's been beefing up with new AI tools -- continued to generate double-digit sales growth with rising operating margins."", ""Analysts expect Alphabet's revenue and earnings to grow 11% and 16%, respectively, in 2024. Those growth rates are stable, but it trades at just 21 times forward earnings, which makes it another cheap play on the growing AI market."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

For instance, the FAANG acronym was coined by CNBC financial analyst Jim Cramer in 2017 to describe five of the largest technology companies at the time:"", 'Facebook, which now trades as Meta Platforms', 'Apple', 'Amazon ', 'Netflix ', 'Google, which now trades as Alphabet ', 'Then in 2023, Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett named a new group of technology stocks the ""Magnificent Seven."" Each of them convincingly outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 index last year. These seven stocks also have something more important in common: Each company is developing artificial intelligence (AI) in its own unique way:', 'Meta Platforms', 'Apple', 'Amazon', 'Alphabet', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)', 'Tesla', ""However, the connection to AI might not be enough to keep this band together. Most of the Magnificent Seven stocks opened 2024 with more upside. The exception was Tesla, which plunged 23% in January alone. CNBC's Cramer thinks Tesla should be booted from the Magnificent Seven, and Glen Kacher from Light Street Capital thinks the group needs to be entirely reconstructed."", 'Kacher has identified five stocks and named them the ""AI 5."" Let\'s take a closer look at all five and see why each could lead the market higher from here.', 'It should come as no surprise that any group of stocks named the AI 5 would include Nvidia. Its H100 data center GPU chip is the leading hardware choice among developers to build, train, and deploy their AI models. In early 2023 HSBC analysts estimated Nvidia had a 90% market share in that segment, and its financial results appeared to back that up.', 'In the recent fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended Oct. 29, 2023), Nvidia generated $18.1 billion in total revenue, which was up a whopping 206% from the year-ago period. Its data center revenue accounted for $14.5 billion of that, which marked an increase of 279%. Those incredible growth rates helped Nvidia stock surge 239% last year, and the upside momentum carried into 2024.', ""Nvidia is now gearing up for the wide release of its new H200 data center chip. When it comes to inferencing -- which involves feeding an AI model real live data so it can make predictions -- the H200 is up to twice as fast as the H100. Plus it consumes 50% less energy, so it's far cheaper to run for operators of centralized data centers."", 'Considering Nvidia is struggling to keep up with demand, the strength in its business will likely continue throughout this calendar year. It certainly deserves its spot in the AI 5.', ""Microsoft is another dominant force in the emerging AI industry, but it's playing to its historical strengths and focusing on the software side. Microsoft invested $10 billion in leading AI start-up OpenAI last year, which is responsible for the popular ChatGPT online chatbot."", ""Microsoft has since used OpenAI's technology to integrate generative AI applications into its entire software suite, including the Windows operating system, 365 document suite, Bing search engine, Edge internet browser, and the Azure cloud platform. Copilot for 365, for example, allows users to rapidly create content in applications like Word, Excel, and PowerPoint, which boosts productivity, especially in corporate settings."", ""Azure OpenAI Service, on the other hand, delivers OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models to Azure's cloud customers so they can use the technology to develop AI applications for their own needs."", ""Microsoft recently surpassed Apple to become the most valuable company in the world, with a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion. It's one of only a few companies successfully monetizing AI software already, and that could drive its next phase of growth."", ""Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) makes some of the world's most popular chips for computers, mobile devices, cars, and data centers. All eyes are on its new MI300 lineup of data center GPUs, which were designed to rival Nvidia's industry-leading hardware, and it's off to a great start."", ""The MI300 comes in two configurations. The MI300X is a pure GPU, whereas the MI300A combines GPU and CPU hardware to create the world's first accelerated processing unit (APU) for data centers. The latter is the chip of choice for the new El Capitan supercomputer at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which is slated to be the fastest in the world when it comes online this year."", ""Tesla might also be using the MI300 soon to train its AI and autonomous self-driving models, according to CEO Elon Musk. Nvidia's GPUs are the company's first choice, but a lack of supply means it has to source chips from elsewhere too. AMD is an obvious choice for Tesla, given AMD chips already power the infotainment systems inside its electric vehicles."", 'AMD stock is off to a flying start to 2024 with a gain of 28% already. Investors will learn more about MI300 demand throughout the year, but the early signs make AMD a worthy member of the new AI 5.', ""Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is arguably the most important company in the chip industry. It manufactures more than half of the world's chips, including the advanced GPUs designed by companies like Nvidia and AMD. Without TSMC, who knows where the AI industry would be right now?"", ""The company's revenue was down in 2023. It suffered from the supply glut of chips that began in 2022, as consumers trimmed their spending on big-ticket electronics in the wake of high inflation and rising interest rates. However, in the fourth quarter (ended Dec. 31) it saw 17% quarter-over-quarter growth in its high-performance computing segment as demand for AI chips ramped up. It also delivered 27% quarter-over-quarter growth in its smartphone segment, as companies like Apple transitioned to 3-nanometer chips, which lay the foundation for on-device AI."", ""Wall Street now expects TSMC's revenue to grow by 22% in 2024 to $85 billion. Analysts are looking for a further 20% growth in 2025, taking the company's revenue above $100 billion for the first time. Considering TSMC's crucial role in manufacturing AI chips in all categories, its stock is likely a great bet going forward, and it certainly belongs in the AI 5."", ""Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) probably isn't at the top of many investors' watchlists when it comes to AI, but the company is developing the technology in several different ways. Not to mention Broadcom stock has more than quadrupled over the last five years, so it's worth paying attention."", ""Broadcom was founded in 1991, but it merged with Avago Technologies in 2016, which transformed the company. It's now a conglomerate featuring the original Broadcom, Avago, semiconductor device supplier CA Technologies, cybersecurity provider Symantec, and cloud software developer VMware."", ""Broadcom is a leader in networking and server connectivity. It develops data center switches that determine how fast data travels from one point to another, and its latest Tomahawk 5 is an industry-leading product that is accelerating AI workloads. Plus, Symantec recently signed a deal with Google Cloud's Vertex AI platform to deliver faster and more accurate cybersecurity solutions."", ""Broadcom closed its VMware acquisition last year, so VMware's financials will be consolidated with the conglomerate from fiscal 2024 (which began in November 2023). Broadcom's guidance suggests its revenue will soar 40% during fiscal 2024 as a result, so this overlooked stock might have plenty of growth left in the tank."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

While Intel is still well behind TSMC technologically, the company's roadmap calls for a dramatic shift by the start of 2025. Over the next year, Intel is set to launch three new process nodes, with the final Intel 18A node expected to be the best in the industry, or at least on par with what TSMC has to offer."", 'Intel has won a handful of customers for Intel 18A so far, but converting those commitments to meaningful revenue will take time. And of course, Intel still needs to prove to prospective customers that it can not only launch Intel 18A on time but also that the process can deliver the expected performance and efficiency characteristics.', ""A quicker path to meaningful revenue for Intel's foundry business will come from advanced-packaging services. The process of packaging a semiconductor following manufacturing is critical, and as chips have become more advanced, packaging techniques have evolved. While traditional-packaging technology will remain widely used for the foreseeable future, advanced-packaging technologies enable 3D-chip stacking and other capabilities that have become increasingly necessary for the most advanced AI, smartphone, PC, and server chips."", 'Intel disclosed in its fourth-quarter report that it had won a total of five advanced-packaging customers, with the majority of revenue generation set to kick in starting in 2025. A recent rumor suggests that Intel may have recently added another advanced-packaging win.', 'United Daily News, a Chinese-language publication out of the Philippines, reported last week that NVIDIA had chosen Intel to provide advanced-packaging services for a portion of its AI chip production. TSMC has been struggling to keep up with demand for its own advanced-packaging services, so it would certainly make sense for NVIDIA to seek out other providers.', ""Intel recently opened a brand new advanced-packaging facility in New Mexico, the result of a $3.5 billion investment. Intel's 3D-packaging technology is called Foveros, and it was first used in high-volume production for Intel's own Meteor Lake laptop CPUs that launched in December."", 'For Intel, selling advanced-packaging services for chips manufactured elsewhere has the benefit of acting as an on-ramp into its foundry ecosystem. By choosing Intel, an advanced-packaging customer can become comfortable with that company as a partner and eventually move some manufacturing over to Intel as well.', ""If this rumor is true, NVIDIA will only be using Intel for advanced packaging, not actual semiconductor production. However, if Intel succeeds in surpassing TSMC technologically in 2025, the company's manufacturing services will become far more appealing to NVIDIA and any other major chip designer. Winning NVIDIA as an advanced-packaging customer would also be a huge vote of confidence in Intel's fledgling foundry business."", ""As always, unconfirmed reports like this should be taken with a grain of salt. If Intel is indeed joining NVIDIA's supply chain, that would be incredibly good news for Intel's foundry initiative and shareholders holding on tight as Intel invests heavily to take on TSMC."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Intel wasn't one of them.

But unlike rival Nvidia, which has seen revenue and profits surge, AMD's rally relies on future expectations more than current results. Let's discuss the company's recently reported fourth-quarter earnings and explore how its chip business could evolve over the coming years. "", ""AMD's fourth-quarter earnings report was a mixed bag. Total revenue grew by 10% year over year to $6.17 billion on strength in its data center segment, which rose 38%. The company recently released the latest versions of its AMD Instinct graphics processing units (GPUs) designed for training and running AI applications. And these products likely contributed to the healthy expansion in the period."", ""With that said, AMD sells more than just data center chips. Other segments like gaming and embedded hardware fell 17% and 24%, respectively, leading to an overall lackluster showing. The company's future guidance also left much to be desired. "", ""Management projects first-quarter sales of $5.4 billion, a steep discount to the $5.73 billion analysts expected. But most alarmingly, the company expects data center revenue to be flat as declines in central processing unit (CPU) sales offset growth in the new AI GPUs. For the full year of 2024, CEO Lisa Su expects data center GPUs to add $3.5 billion to AMD's top line. But this won't mean much if the company's other segments continue to decline by a similar or greater amount. "", ""Right now, AMD's bull thesis rests on Lisa Su's projection that the AI chip market could rise to $400 billion by 2027. If AMD can capture just 5% of that opportunity, it could add a whopping $20 billion to its revenue in just three years -- probably enough to overcome any possible weakness in its other businesses. The company has already secured large cloud customers like Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta, which will use its Instinct GPUs to help power both internal and external workloads."", ""To grow market share, AMD must make its chips competitive with Nvidia's flagship H100. And it can do this by focusing on performance and price. "", ""The Financial Times estimates that each Nvidia H100 costs $40,000. And Nvidia's gross margin rose from 54% to 74% in the third quarter, which suggests it is taking advantage of the lack of alternatives to hike prices. The market looks ripe for more lower-cost options. "", ""But talk (and estimates) are cheap. Over the coming years, AMD will have to take advantage of this opportunity to grow its AI chip business. And so far it has not shown concrete results that justify its stock's rally."", ""The AI industry is expected to expand massively over the next three years, and AMD is in a prime position to capitalize on this growth. But that doesn't mean the stock lives up to its lofty price tag. "", 'With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) of 44, AMD has a higher valuation than Nvidia, which trades for a forward P/E of 30. This means it has very little room for error, and the next three years will be a make-or-break period for the company. Shares remain a buy, but more cautious investors may want to wait for more quarters of data before taking a position.

However, chip companies at earlier stages in their ventures into AI could have more room to run. This is part of why Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) is an attractive investment option in the space.', 'In 2023, Nvidia became the first chipmaker to exceed a market cap of $1 trillion. AMD still has a long way to go before coming anywhere close to that figure, with its market cap at $286 billion. However, that could mean it has far more growth potential over the long term.', ""AMD is on a promising growth trajectory as it gears up to challenge Nvidia with a new AI GPU and benefits from an improving PC market. The company's shares are up 123% year over year but are nowhere near hitting their ceiling."", ""Here's why AMD's stock could soar higher in 2024."", ""According to Grand View Research, the AI market reached nearly $200 billion last year and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. That trajectory would see the industry surpass $1 trillion before the end of the decade. As a result, it's not surprising that tech companies like AMD are investing heavily in the budding sector."", ""AMD unveiled the next installment in its line of MI300 chips last December, debuting its most powerful GPU ever: the MI300X. The new chip is designed to compete with Nvidia's H100 AI GPU. In fact, AMD is promising that the MI300X is on par with Nvidia's offerings for training. AMD also claims that it beats the H100 for inference by 10% to 20%."", ""However, the AI market's rapid growth rate suggests AMD won't need to dethrone Nvidia to still see major gains from the industry. Nvidia could retain a leading market share in AI GPUs while AMD carves out a lucrative role in the sector. And its MI300X is already attracting some of tech's most prominent players."", ""Last November, Microsoft announced Azure would become the first cloud platform to implement AMD's new GPU to optimize its AI capabilities. Microsoft has a close partnership with OpenAI, making the company a powerful ally for AMD. Alongside an agreement with Meta Platforms -- which will see it utilize the new chips as well -- AMD's future in AI looks bright."", 'In addition to AI, AMD is benefiting from a gradually improving PC market. Data from Gartner\xa0shows global PC shipments increased 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, rising for the first time in over a year. Macroeconomic headwinds are subsiding, with the PC market expected to continue improving throughout 2024.', ""The improvements are already reflected in AMD's earnings. In its Q3 2023, revenue in its client segment rose 42% year over year to $1.4 billion. Alongside potential in AI, AMD could be in for a stellar growth year in 2024."", ""Earnings-per-share (EPS) estimates align with the company's potential, with its stock projected to soar in its next fiscal year."", ""This chart shows AMD's earnings could hit just over $5 per share by the end of its next fiscal year. Multiplying that figure by the chipmaker's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 45 yields a stock price of $239."", ""If projections are correct, AMD's shares would rise 35% by the end of fiscal 2024, outperforming the S&P 500's increase of 20% over the last 12 months."", 'AMD is on a promising growth trajectory, making its stock a no-brainer in the new year.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Advanced Micro Devices wasn't one of them.

Robinson Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHRW) shares in the week since its full-year report, with the stock down 15% to US$74.13. Revenues were in line with forecasts, at US$18b, although statutory earnings per share came in 18% below what the analysts expected, at US$2.72 per share. Following the result, the analysts have updated their earnings model, and it would be good to know whether they think there's been a strong change in the company's prospects, or if it's business as usual. So we collected the latest post-earnings statutory consensus estimates to see what could be in store for next year."", ' See our latest analysis for C.H. Robinson Worldwide ', ""Following last week's earnings report, C.H. Robinson Worldwide's 21 analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be US$17.7b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory earnings per share are predicted to surge 24% to US$3.45. Before this earnings report, the analysts had been forecasting revenues of US$18.1b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$3.88 in 2024. The analysts seem to have become more bearish following the latest results. While there were no changes to revenue forecasts, there was a real cut to EPS estimates."", ""The average price target fell 6.2% to US$81.14, with reduced earnings forecasts clearly tied to a lower valuation estimate. Fixating on a single price target can be unwise though, since the consensus target is effectively the average of analyst price targets. As a result, some investors like to look at the range of estimates to see if there are any diverging opinions on the company's valuation. Currently, the most bullish analyst values C.H. Robinson Worldwide at US$104 per share, while the most bearish prices it at US$60.00. As you can see, analysts are not all in agreement on the stock's future, but the range of estimates is still reasonably narrow, which could suggest that the outcome is not totally unpredictable."", ""One way to get more context on these forecasts is to look at how they compare to both past performance, and how other companies in the same industry are performing. We would highlight that C.H. Robinson Worldwide's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 0.8% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 8.4% p.a. growth over the last five years. By way of comparison, the other companies in this industry with analyst coverage are forecast to grow their revenue at 4.2% per year. So it's pretty clear that, while revenue growth is expected to slow down, the wider industry is also expected to grow faster than C.H. Robinson Worldwide."", 'The most important thing to take away is that the analysts downgraded their earnings per share estimates, showing that there has been a clear decline in sentiment following these results. On the plus side, there were no major changes to revenue estimates; although forecasts imply they will perform worse than the wider industry. Furthermore, the analysts also cut their price targets, suggesting that the latest news has led to greater pessimism about the intrinsic value of the business.', ""With that in mind, we wouldn't be too quick to come to a conclusion on C.H. Robinson Worldwide. Long-term earnings power is much more important than next year's profits. We have estimates - from multiple C.H. Robinson Worldwide analysts - going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here."", 'Before you take the next step you should know about the 2 warning signs for C.H.

Its core entertainment business -- parks and streaming services -- is growing. The problem areas are largely centered around the returns the company is earning on capital spending. It simply needs to be more efficient with expenses."", ""Here's where Disney is making progress to fix the issue, and what it will take to move the stock higher."", ""The company's losses sent the stock down, but higher profits can send it back up.

In the September-ending quarter, it added 7 million new subscribers, pushing DTC segment revenue for the quarter up 12% year over year to $5 billion, which also benefited from higher pricing.', 'Most importantly, Disney reported a $1 billion improvement in operating loss, which puts its streaming business on track to turn a profit by the end of September, as originally planned.', ""What's more, the company might have further pricing power to grow margins. Disney+ is adding a healthy amount of subscribers even as the plan without ads is $13.99 -- slightly lower than Netflix's $15.49 per month."", ""Even with the cheaper $7.99 ad-supported plan, customers are not balking at paying a higher price than Netflix. The company reported that half of new Disney+ subscribers are opting for the ad-supported plan despite its costing $1 more than Netflix's ad plan."", ""Disney's content is unique and valuable. This shows up in box office numbers, where it had four of the 10 top-grossing films last year. It's also showing up at the theme parks, which are generating significantly higher revenue and profits than before the pandemic. This is why Disney stock is worth buying below $100, but there are still other issues that could limit its gains this year."", ""The weak results at Disney's TV networks (like ABC and ESPN) have been a drag on the company's growth. A weak advertising market sent network revenue down 9% year over year in the September-ending quarter."", ""But the strong growth in the rest of the business means the networks are contributing less to Disney's total revenue, which grew 5% year over year in the September-ending quarter."", ""A bigger problem is the company's debt burden. Disney took on a lot of debt to finance the acquisition of Fox's entertainment assets a few years ago. Long-term debt stood at $46 billion in September, which doesn't look good when the company's profits have deteriorated."", 'While Disney generated almost $10 billion in cash from operations in fiscal 2023 and is sitting on $17 billion of cash and investments to offset the debt, the financial hole makes the stock look more expensive.', ""Adding Disney's net debt to its market cap (share price times total shares outstanding), the stock is trading at 14.6 times the company's fiscal 2019 operating income. This is higher than the stock's average valuation of 12.3 times operating income over the last decade."", ""So even if Disney returned to pre-pandemic levels of profitability, roughly $15 billion in annual operating profit, the stock still doesn't look cheap enough to justify significant upside.

But over the last half-century, dividend-paying stocks in the S&P 500 have crushed the average stock's performance in that broad market index (9.2% average annualized return versus 7.7% for an S&P 500 equal-weight index). The best performance has come from stocks that grow their dividends (a 10.2% average annualized total return). "", ""Public Storage (NYSE: PSA), Prologis (NYSE: PLD), and CareTrust REIT (NYSE: CTRE) stand out to these three Motley Fool contributors for their ability to deliver market-beating total returns. Here's why they don't want investors to miss out on these above-average dividend stocks. "", 'Tyler Crowe (Public Storage): There are few businesses as durable as personal storage units.', 'Paying for a storage unit is one of those expenses people are hesitant to stop, and unlike long-term contracts for other types of commercial real estate, storage unit contracts tend to adjust to market rates sooner with shorter-term contracts. Self-storage real estate investment trusts (REITs) have been stellar investments over the years.', 'One business in this industry that stands out today as particularly interesting is Public Storage. While its stock has not performed as well as others over the past decade and its dividend increases have been sporadic, it has maintained a much more conservative balance sheet than its peers.', 'Having a superior balance sheet and the capacity to borrow could be extremely valuable should interest rates remain high in 2024 and beyond. Companies facing debt maturities and potentially higher interest rates could be in the market to sell assets. Public Storage appears to be incredibly well positioned to take advantage of this.', ""Public Storage's dividend increases have been sporadic, but the REIT has either maintained or increased its dividend since 1990, and its current yield of 4% is on the high end of its historical average. A higher-than-average yield coupled with a chance to pounce on distressed assets could be a winning formula in the coming years."", 'Matt DiLallo (Prologis): Prologis has been a dividend-growth powerhouse. The leading industrial REIT has raised its payout at a 15% compound annual rate since its initial public offering (IPO).', ' That ranks it 13th in the S&P 100 (the 100 biggest publicly traded companies in the country) for dividend growth. It has continued to increase its payout at an above-average rate even as it has grown into one of the largest REITs. ', ""Over the last five years, Prologis has raised its payout at a more than 12% compound annual rate. That's over twice as fast as the S&P 500 and REIT sector average during that period. "", 'The company is in an excellent position to continue growing its above-average dividend (it currently yields 2.7% compared to 1.5% for the S&P 500) at a brisk pace. Prologis grew its core funds from operations (FFO) by 11% per share last year.', "" Meanwhile, it expects to deliver around 9% growth in core FFO per share in 2024 at the midpoint of its guidance range. That's at the low end of its projected average annual growth range of 9% to 11% in FFO per share through 2026. "", ""Another factor driving Prologis' ability to deliver above-average dividend growth is its industry-leading balance sheet. It has the lowest weighted average interest rate among the largest REITs and the longest average remaining life on its debt. "", 'Prologis also has a low leverage ratio and a sterling credit rating. On top of all that, it has a lower dividend payout ratio. Those qualities give it lots of financial flexibility to invest in high-return development projects and accretive acquisitions to accelerate its growth rate. ', 'Prologis has also delivered above-average total returns (17.4% annually compared to 14.9% for the S&P 500 over the last decade). With its dividend likely to continue rising briskly, Prologis is ideal for those seeking an above-average dividend stock.

Information concerning risk factors that could cause such differences are described in the press release covering our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results, as well as having been posted on our website."", 'Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Greg Case, CEO of Aon plc.', ""Greg Case: Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our fourth quarter conference call. I'm joined by Christa Davies, our CFO; and Eric Andersen, our President. As in previous quarters, we posted a detailed financial presentation on our website. We want to start with a very sincere thank you to our Aon colleagues around the world for all they've done in 2023 pivotal for our clients and support each other. As we reflect on 2023, we observed that the client demand driving our Aon United journey. Trends around increasing volatility and interconnected risk have accelerated. Specifically, we see four broad areas of focus that increase the relevance of our core business and create opportunity to deliver more value to clients. These four megatrends revolve around trade and the consequence of sustained geopolitical uncertainty."", ""Technology, particularly the rise of AI, weather reflecting the rate of natural catastrophes and workforce where the pandemic has fundamentally impacted talent. These profound transitions described in our Global Risk Management Survey and Human Capital Trends Report require clients to both deliver against today's expectations and evolve to make better decisions on new risk and people challenges. Against that backdrop, we've taken significant steps to accelerate our Aon United strategy in ways that drove performance in 2023 and set the stage to build momentum and deliver stronger performance in 2024. Most notably, we're executing our three-by-three plan to leverage our risk capital and human capital structure and capability, embed the Aon Client leadership model across the firm and utilize Aon Business Services to set a new standard of innovation and client service."", 'We then doubled down on this plan by announcing a $900 million investment into our business to accelerate Aon Business Services as a catalyst for the three-by-three plan and the complete workforce strategy effort to reflect our simplified and more connected go-to-market strategy. We closed the year with strong operating momentum and also took action to build upon our ABS driven capability to deliver innovative and accretive new products into the middle-market by announcing our intent to acquire NFP. NFP under the leadership of Doug Hammond and an exceptional team is the premier operating platform in the middle-market segment with tremendous client relationships and distribution. And together, we can bring stronger analytics and innovation to this space and not just capability but content that can serve the middle market like Aon Cyber Quotient Evaluation or CyQI, a proprietary platform that helps clients identify, measure and manage cyber risk.', ""NFP's operating platform will enable quick and efficient connections to Aon Business Services content driving meaningful growth in the middle market. And we're incredibly excited about the top and bottom-line growth potential for NFP, given our complementary businesses and expected synergies and the value it will create. For Aon overall and barely one month into 2024, we already feel the momentum from these actions that's demonstrated through the client benefits of our integrated risk capital and human capital capabilities. On the risk capital side, our recent weather, climate, and catastrophe report highlights the growing frequency and severity of events around the world as clients look to manage volatility, enhance resilience and unlock opportunity."", ""To do this, organizations must have more actionable analytics, exactly the insight we bring with risk capital through the combined power of reinsurance, commercial risk analytics and expertise for our clients. We recently saw this in action at our Annual Property symposium with over 1,000 clients in insurance markets in the room where we demonstrated a new suite of advanced analytic tools that bring together content and capability across reinsurance and commercial risk. One example is our property risk analyzer giving clients a better understanding of the risk profile in real time, which allows us to work more closely together to provide better insight into the risk mitigation options and enable them to make better decisions. From the overwhelming feedback and engagement, it's clear our clients are demanding better solutions and greater support."", ""And because of the steps we've taken and progress we've made with Aon Business Services on products and platforms, we can develop and roll these tools out more quickly for our largest clients, and the clients of all sizes deliver efficiently at scale. Equally compelling for Human Capital, our Human Capital trends report highlights the rising importance to clients, but having a unique and differentiated value proposition for employees. We see clients facing significant rising healthcare costs and lower overall population health at a time they need to provide broad health and well-being offerings is greater than ever. We also saw attracting and retaining top talent as the fourth ranked risk in our Global Risk Management Survey. Our clients realize it's more important than ever to have a compelling strategy across health, wealth and talent needs that's delivered in an efficient way to maximize the benefit rewards offering."", ""Together, this creates significant opportunity to work with clients to design and optimize their programs including core offerings to improve colleague health. Our operations drive workers' compensation costs, choosing optimal partners in their health model and supporting top talent is a strong employee value proposition, to ultimately maximize return on investment or their people spend. All these are examples of our three-by-three plan in action. It's human capital and risk capital delivered through our Aon Client leadership model and enabled by our Aon Business Services. These three pillars reinforce and accelerate our Aon United strategy, which has driven financial performance and gives us great confidence in our outlook. On financial performance, we delivered strong results in the quarter that contribute to full-year progress against our key financial metrics."", ""Organic revenue growth of 7% in the quarter and 7% for the full-year was highlighted by full-year double-digit growth in reinsurance solutions and health solutions. And we've maintained strong overall growth throughout the year on top of 6% organic in the prior year. In the fourth quarter, commercial risk grew 4% organically with strength in property, casualty and construction even against the headwind communicated in prior quarters of ongoing pressure from trends in the M&A and IPO markets. Wealth solutions, organic growth of 5% in Q4 reflects strong growth in retirement, which includes growth from ongoing pension risk transfer projects and work to help clients address changing regulatory requirements. Reinsurance solutions organic growth was 14% contributing to full-year organic growth of 10% with our team closed the year strong, while also helping clients prepare for and execute an early one-one renewal."", ""Health solutions delivered 11% organic growth, reflecting the strength around the world in the core, driven by net new business and retention, as well as strong growth in the U.S. consumer benefit solutions. This performance gives us confidence in our ability to drive ongoing growth across the portfolio, fully reflecting the strength of Aon United. For the full-year, 7% organic growth and ongoing operational improvement contributed to 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 10% adjusted operating income growth. These strong results demonstrate our progress and momentum, as well as the power of Aon United strategy and Aon Business Services platform. This performance builds on our long-term track-record of results. Over the past 12 years, we've strengthened and accelerated organic revenue growth to mid-single digits or greater, delivered over 400 basis points of adjusted operating margin, expansion and growth in EPS and free-cash flow at 11% compounded annual rate ending 2023 with nearly $3.2 billion in free cash flow."", ""The steps we've taken to accelerate Aon United with our three-by-three plan reinforce and strengthen our long-term financial guidance for the firm including mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth in 2024 and over the long-term, adjusted operating margin expansion over the long-term and long-term double-digit free-cash flow growth. As we've communicated initiatives like our restructuring program and expected acquisition of NFP impact this guidance in the near-term and over time, we believe these initiatives will contribute to significant ongoing shareholder value creation. More important we view the opportunity is higher over the next five years than at any time in our history. And in closing, we're pleased to report another strong year of progress against our Aon United strategy, which we're accelerating with our three-by-three plan, deliver risk capital and human capital at scale fully reinforced through Aon Business Services."", 'Looking back on a year, we delivered accelerating growth across three or four solution lines and built momentum across the firm. Including 7% full-year organic revenue growth, 80 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion, 10% adjusted operating income growth and nearly $3.2 billion of free cash flow. Equally important, we took a series of major actions that position Aon for stronger performance in 2024 and over the coming years. Now. I would like to turn the call over to Christa for her thoughts on our financial results and long term outlook. Christa?', ""Christa Davies: Thanks so much Greg, and good morning everyone. As Greg highlighted, we delivered strong operating results in the fourth quarter to finish the year strong. In the quarter, we translated 7% organic revenue growth into 60 basis points of adjusted operating margin expansion and 10% adjusted operating income growth. The full year 2023, we delivered 7% organic revenue growth, 80 basis points of margin expansion, 6% EPS growth and generated $3.2 billion of free cash flow. In the quarter, we announced out definitive agreement to acquire leading broker NFP, enabling us to unlock the fast-growing mid-markets with Aon Business Services enabled enhanced distribution and further accelerate our Aon United strategy. The steps that we've taken around Aon Business Services now enables us to address this attractive market in a compelling way that delivers risk capital and human capital at scale to clients of all sizes."", 'The expected acquisition of NFP builds on our long-term proven track record of strategically allocating capital at scale to high return opportunities to create long-term value for clients, colleagues and shareholders. And as Greg mentioned, we see the expected acquisition and our restructuring program, reinforcing our Aon United Strategy and our three-by-three plan. We are extremely well-positioned to build on this momentum as we head into 2024. As I reflect on our results, as Greg noted, organic revenue growth was 7% in Q4 and for the full-year, highlighted by double-digit organic revenue growth in Reinsurance Solutions and Health Solutions. I would note that reported revenue growth of 8% in Q4 includes this favorable impact from changes in FX of 2%, and there is no net impact from changes in FX to full-year reported revenue.', ""I'd also highlight fiduciary investment income, which is not included in organic revenue growth, was $78 million in Q4 and $274 million for the full-year. If you were to include fiduciary investment income, organic revenue growth would have been 8% in both Q4 and the full-year. We continue to expect mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth for the full-year 2024 and over the long-term. Moving to operating performance. We delivered strong operational improvement in Q4 with adjusted operating margins of 33.8%, an increase of 60 basis-points, driven by revenue growth, efficiencies from Aon Business Services, overcoming expense growth, including investment in colleagues and technology to drive long-term growth. For the full-year, adjusted operating margins of 31.6% reflect margin expansion of 80 basis points."", ""As previously communicated, there was no impact on margin from restructuring savings. Looking forward, we expect to deliver margin expansion in 2024 and over the long-term, as we continue our track-record of cost discipline and managing investments in long-term growth on ROIC basis. We expect restructuring savings will fall to the bottom-line and contribute to full-year adjusted operating margin expansion. Restructuring actions completed in 2023 are expected to generate $70 million of run-rate savings in 2024. At this time, we continue to expect a $100 million of run-rate savings in 2024 as we continue to execute against our plans at Aon Business Services and our business. As we've previously communicated, we conservatively modeled the expected acquisition of NFP to close mid-year 2025."", ""While the combined adjusted operating margin will initially be lower than Aon standalone, we expect over time to continue to improve Aon's overall margins through operational improvement and the impacts from previously communicated cost synergies. Turning to EPS. Adjusted EPS was flat in Q4. Operating income grew 10%, but was offset by a headwind from a higher tax-rate in the quarter and non-operating expense. For the full-year, organic revenue growth and margin expansion translated into adjusted EPS growth of 6%, overcoming a headwind from non-operating expense. I'd note, the change in other non-operating expense had a $0.15 per share or 4% unfavorable impact in Q4 and a $0.98 per share or 7% unfavorable impact for the full-year. This reflects an unfavorable impact from balance sheet FX remeasurement in the current period, an increase in non-cash net periodic pension expense, as well as a gain on sale of businesses in the prior year period."", ""Also, as noted in our earnings materials, FX translation had a favorable impact or approximately $0.03 per share in Q4 and an unfavorable impact of $0.17 per share for the full-year. If currency to remain stable at today's rates, we would expect no material net translation impact results for the full-year 2024. Additionally, in 2024 we expect non-cash pension expense NOI to be $43 million, spread evenly across quarters, compared to $71 million in 2023. And as we've previously communicated based on a mid-2025 close, the expected acquisition of NFP is expected to be dilutive in 2025, breakeven to adjusted 2026 EPS and accretive in 2027 and beyond. At this time, there are no further updates on the regulatory process or deal timeline for NFP. Turning to free-cash flow, we generated $3.3 billion of free-cash flow in 2023."", ""For the full-year, cash from operations increased $216 million Year-over-Year, or 7%, reflecting double-digit operating income growth and overall working capital optimization, partially offset by higher cash tax payments. I'd note, the negative impact to working capital, caused by temporary invoicing delays associated with the new system implementation, which we communicated last quarter persisted in Q4 and impacted our overall continued progress on working capital. Free-cash flow increased 5% as cash-flow from operations was offset in-part by a $56 million or 29% increase in CapEx. CapEx was $252 million in 2023 as we executed technology projects to drive long-term growth. Going forward, we expect CapEx to grow in-line with the business managed on a disciplined ROIC basis."", 'Looking forward, free-cash flow will be impacted in the near-term by restructuring, higher interest expense and the expected NFP deal and integration costs. We expect to return to our trajectory of double-digit free-cash flow growth over the long-term, driven by operating income growth and a $500 million opportunity in working capital. As we contemplate the expected acquisition of NFP, the transaction strengthens our long-term free-cash flow outlook. We expect the transaction to add over $300 million of free-cash flow in 2026 and $600 million of free-cash flow in 2027. Now let me provide an update on our accelerating Aon United program which is enabling Aon Business Services and our three-by-three plan. As Greg highlighted, three-by-three plan is accelerating our Aon United strategy.', ""We see particular opportunity around Aon Business Services as the catalyst. We are investing to standardized platforms and operations, drive data analytic-based product innovation and deliver at scale to create better tools, better experiences and greater relevance to clients and colleagues. In the fourth quarter, we incurred a $129 million of restructuring-related charges with a cash outflow of $13 million. We're pleased with the progress we made in the quarter and we've incurred 12% of total expected cash restructuring charges. The actions we've taken in 2023 are expected to generate $70 million of run-rate savings in 2024, contributing to the $100 million of cumulative savings we expect for full-year 2024. As mentioned, program savings were not material in 2023."", ""As we've said previously, we look at the opportunity in Aon Business Services and across our client-facing capabilities. We now are delivering our strategy will result in long-term progress against our key financial metrics and will drive more value for clients, colleagues and shareholders. Turning now to capital allocation. We allocate capital based on return on capital and long-term value creation. I'd note, over time, we've driven value creation through core business results, share buyback and acquisitions. As you look historically, we have a successful track record of balancing acquisitions and dispositions of all sizes and share buyback. Given our strong outlook for free-cash flow over the long-term, we expect share repurchases to continue to remain our highest-return on capital opportunity for meaningful ongoing capital allocation."", ""We believe we are significantly undervalued in the market today, highlighted by the $2.7 billion of share repurchase in 2023. We expect to continue to invest organically in content and capabilities we can scale across the firm and we'll continue to assess priority as inorganic investments noting our M&A pipeline continues to be focused on our global priority areas that will bring scalable solutions to our clients growing and evolving challenges. We will continue to assess all capital allocation decisions on an ROIC basis. Noting we ended 2023 with an ROIC of 33.1%, an increase of nearly 2,100 basis-points over the last 12 years, reflecting our track record of balancing growth and returns to create long-term value. I'd note ROIC will initially be negatively impacted after the expected acquisition of NFP."", ""We expect it to improve over time as we execute our Aon United strategy to drive long-term value creation. Our expected acquisition of NFP is consistent with our proven capital allocation framework. It enables us to put capital to work at-scale and strengthen our free-cash flow profile in the long-term, which will continue to allocate to drive shareholder value creation. Between now and the expected close of the deal, we expect discretionary capital allocation will continue to be much more weighted towards share buyback, given the commitments we've made around NFP. Following the expected close of NFP, free-cash flow will be impacted in the near-term by deal and integration costs and higher interest expense, transaction-related debt, and as we take steps to delever our balance sheet and return metrics to levels consistent with our current credit ratings profile."", ""Turning now to our balance sheet and debt capacity. We remain confident in the strength of our balance sheet and manage liquidity risk through a well-laddered debt maturity profile. We remain committed to maintaining our current investment grade credit ratings. We expect to continue adding debt supported by EBITDA growth until we complete the expected acquisition of NFP and expect to maintain our current ratings. As we've previously communicated, we expect to fund the cash portion of the purchase with approximately $7 billion of new debt with $2 billion borrowed at close and $5 billion raised in 2024 across a range of maturities, subject to market conditions. Following the transaction related debt issuance in 2024, we expect to incur approximately $12.5 million of negative interest carry expense per quarter until deal close."", 'As we previously communicated, the financing and capital management plan contemplated in this transaction is consistent with maintaining our current investment grade credit profile. We expect our credit ratios to be elevated over the 12 to 18 months post close. And we expect to bring our leverage ratios back in line with levels consistent with our credit profile, driven by substantial free cash flow generation and incremental debt capacity from EBITDA growth noting our track-record of effectively managing leverage within current ratings. In summary, in 2023, we delivered strong operational performance contributing to continued progress against our Aon United strategy. Our strong financial results and disciplined capital management enables us to return to $3.2 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.', ""The steps we've taken around our three-by-three plan are accelerating our Aon United strategy catalyzed by Aon Business Services and reinforced by the restructuring program and our expected acquisition of NFP. We remain incredibly excited about the opportunity to continue to drive top and bottom-line results to drive value for clients, colleagues and shareholders and look forward to building on this momentum in 2024 . With that, I'll turn the call-back over to the operator and we'd be delighted to take your questions."", 'See also 35 Low-Stress High-Paying Jobs In The World and 15 Countries that Produce the Best Software Engineers.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

But over the last half-century, dividend-paying stocks in the S&P 500 have crushed the average stock's performance in that broad market index (9.2% average annualized return versus 7.7% for an S&P 500 equal-weight index). The best performance has come from stocks that grow their dividends (a 10.2% average annualized total return). "", ""Public Storage (NYSE: PSA), Prologis (NYSE: PLD), and CareTrust REIT (NYSE: CTRE) stand out to these three Motley Fool contributors for their ability to deliver market-beating total returns. Here's why they don't want investors to miss out on these above-average dividend stocks. "", 'Tyler Crowe (Public Storage): There are few businesses as durable as personal storage units.', 'Paying for a storage unit is one of those expenses people are hesitant to stop, and unlike long-term contracts for other types of commercial real estate, storage unit contracts tend to adjust to market rates sooner with shorter-term contracts. Self-storage real estate investment trusts (REITs) have been stellar investments over the years.', 'One business in this industry that stands out today as particularly interesting is Public Storage. While its stock has not performed as well as others over the past decade and its dividend increases have been sporadic, it has maintained a much more conservative balance sheet than its peers.', 'Having a superior balance sheet and the capacity to borrow could be extremely valuable should interest rates remain high in 2024 and beyond. Companies facing debt maturities and potentially higher interest rates could be in the market to sell assets. Public Storage appears to be incredibly well positioned to take advantage of this.', ""Public Storage's dividend increases have been sporadic, but the REIT has either maintained or increased its dividend since 1990, and its current yield of 4% is on the high end of its historical average. A higher-than-average yield coupled with a chance to pounce on distressed assets could be a winning formula in the coming years."", 'Matt DiLallo (Prologis): Prologis has been a dividend-growth powerhouse. The leading industrial REIT has raised its payout at a 15% compound annual rate since its initial public offering (IPO).', ' That ranks it 13th in the S&P 100 (the 100 biggest publicly traded companies in the country) for dividend growth. It has continued to increase its payout at an above-average rate even as it has grown into one of the largest REITs. ', ""Over the last five years, Prologis has raised its payout at a more than 12% compound annual rate. That's over twice as fast as the S&P 500 and REIT sector average during that period. "", 'The company is in an excellent position to continue growing its above-average dividend (it currently yields 2.7% compared to 1.5% for the S&P 500) at a brisk pace. Prologis grew its core funds from operations (FFO) by 11% per share last year.', "" Meanwhile, it expects to deliver around 9% growth in core FFO per share in 2024 at the midpoint of its guidance range. That's at the low end of its projected average annual growth range of 9% to 11% in FFO per share through 2026. "", ""Another factor driving Prologis' ability to deliver above-average dividend growth is its industry-leading balance sheet. It has the lowest weighted average interest rate among the largest REITs and the longest average remaining life on its debt. "", 'Prologis also has a low leverage ratio and a sterling credit rating. On top of all that, it has a lower dividend payout ratio. Those qualities give it lots of financial flexibility to invest in high-return development projects and accretive acquisitions to accelerate its growth rate. ', 'Prologis has also delivered above-average total returns (17.4% annually compared to 14.9% for the S&P 500 over the last decade). With its dividend likely to continue rising briskly, Prologis is ideal for those seeking an above-average dividend stock. ', 'Jason Hall (CareTrust REIT): February 2020 through 2022 was brutal for CareTrust, which mainly owns skilled-nursing and senior housing properties, and leases them to operators.', ""During and immediately after the height of the pandemic, this was one of the hardest businesses to run, and many of its tenants struggled mightily. Over that three-year period, CareTrust's stock lost over 20% of its value; even after factoring in dividends paid, investors were down more than 6%."", ""Don't worry, I'm not here to highlight a below-average stock. To the contrary; when you zoom out and look at CareTrust's results since going public, even with the overhang of the pandemic, it's a best-in-class stock, and set to ride a very large tailwind in the decades ahead."", 'Since going public in late 2014, CareTrust has earned its investors 378% in total returns, nearly lapping the S&P 500.', 'Part of those gains are a special dividend paid soon after being spun off Ensign Group, but a ton of value is from the 124% growth in its base dividend over that time.', 'Looking ahead, the aging of baby boomers continues to drive the need for more seniors-focused housing, skilled nursing, and memory care. With only 206 properties, CareTrust has significant room to continue consolidating market share. Maybe most importantly, it has probably the best cash flows and balance sheet of its peers, with a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 5.7 and 35% debt to assets.', 'With a dividend yield of 5.3% at recent prices, a strong record of growing the payout, and a payout ratio of 80% of funds from operations, CareTrust is positioned to deliver extraordinary total returns.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Prologis right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Prologis, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Prologis wasn't one of them.

Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Accordingly, Capital One Financial investors that purchase the stock on or after the 9th of February will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of February."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.60 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.40 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Capital One Financial has a trailing yield of 1.8% on the current stock price of US$136.48. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Capital One Financial's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Capital One Financial has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Capital One Financial ', 'Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Capital One Financial is paying out just 20% of its profit after tax, which is comfortably low and leaves plenty of breathing room in the case of adverse events.', 'When a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.', ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies that aren't growing their earnings can still be valuable, but it is even more important to assess the sustainability of the dividend if it looks like the company will struggle to grow. Investors love dividends, so if earnings fall and the dividend is reduced, expect a stock to be sold off heavily at the same time. That explains why we're not overly excited about Capital One Financial's flat earnings over the past five years. It's better than seeing them drop, certainly, but over the long term, all of the best dividend stocks are able to meaningfully grow their earnings per share."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the past 10 years, Capital One Financial has increased its dividend at approximately 7.2% a year on average."", ""From a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Capital One Financial? Capital One Financial has seen its earnings per share stagnate in recent years, although the company reinvests more than half of its profits in the business, which could bode well for its future prospects. In summary, Capital One Financial appears to have some promise as a dividend stock, and we'd suggest taking a closer look at it."", ""With that in mind, a critical part of thorough stock research is being aware of any risks that stock currently faces. In terms of investment risks, we've identified 1 warning sign with Capital One Financial and understanding them should be part of your investment process."", ""If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article?

That's the billionaire investor's ownership of dividend stocks. These companies have paid him annually, regardless of their performance or the market's performance, ensuring a certain level of guaranteed income."", ""One stock in particular has been interesting, paying millions of dollars annually since the late 1980s when the Berkshire Hathaway chairman first scooped up the shares. I'm talking about Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). In 2022, Coca-Cola paid Berkshire Hathaway $704 million in dividends, up from $75 million back in 1994. Why such an increase? Because the world's biggest non-alcoholic beverage maker has prioritized dividend growth and has a track record of lifting its dividend annually for more than 50 years."", ""Most of us don't have Buffett's investing budget -- but could this dividend powerhouse still represent a valuable addition to your portfolio? Let's find out."", ""First, a little background on a company most of us know pretty well for one reason. Its products populate our refrigerators, and I'm not just talking about the eponymous drink. When you reach for a Dasani water, a Costa coffee, or a Minute Maid juice, you're about to enjoy a Coca-Cola product. People around the globe are doing the same, because the company sells its beverages in more than 200 countries and territories."", ""Coca-Cola has a terrific moat, or competitive advantage, and that's its brand strength. Other companies, large and small, make beverages and can even carve out market share, but it's unlikely they'll oust Coca-Cola from the top spot. The company has proven its strength -- for example, it's lifted prices in recent times to combat higher inflation, but revenue continued to climb. So, consumers, even as they watch their budgets, are willing to pay a bit more for their favorite Coca-Cola beverages."", 'In the most recent quarter, Coca-Cola reported growth in global unit case volume, net revenue, and earnings per share -- and it lifted its full-year earnings forecast. The company also continued to gain value share in the total non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages market.', ""So you can count on Coca-Cola for earnings strength over time, and this is key because it ensures the company's ability to continue growing dividends. The beverage giant has increased free cash flow to about $10 billion, and the cash dividend payout ratio shows that, in recent years, it's generally paid out about 72% to 84% of free cash flow in the form of dividends."", 'Coca-Cola pays a dividend of $1.84 a share, representing a dividend yield of 3.02% -- surpassing the 1.47% dividend yield of the S&P 500.', ""Now, let's get back to our question. Warren Buffett loves this top dividend player, but should you? Even if your investment in this beverage powerhouse doesn't bring in hundreds of millions of dollars in dividends, it still could offer you a very satisfactory level of passive income that you can count on. Coca-Cola's earnings strength and its commitment to dividend growth over the years mean it's likely the company will continue increasing its dividend payments. These can add to your winnings in good times and minimize your losses in difficult market environments."", 'As we can see in the chart below, showing total returns, dividend payments can add significantly to your gains over time.', ""Now, let's look at another point Buffett considers important, and that's valuation. Today, Coca-Cola trades for 21 times forward earnings estimates, down from about 24 a year ago. Even at last year's levels, the price looked reasonable considering the company's market leadership and passive income growth potential -- but today if you buy the stock, you're getting a real bargain."", ""All this means that, even if you don't generate as much passive income as Buffett, you still can score a big win year after year by investing in this top dividend stock."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coca-Cola wasn't one of them.

But one year earlier, Charles Alderton had served up his first glass of Dr Pepper in Waco, Texas -- a carbonated beverage owned by Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ: KDP) today. This makes Dr Pepper older than Coca-Cola.', ""With its first-mover advantage and tasty product, one would think that Dr Pepper went toe-to-toe with Coca-Cola in the early days. However, its sales really underwhelmed for a long time, and companies such as PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) and Canada Dry were Coke's true competition for many decades."", 'In 1961, Coca-Cola had net sales of $537 million and was way out in first place in the carbonated soda industry. PepsiCo (or The Pepsi-Cola Company as it was known at the time) was in a distant third place with sales of $174 million. However, Dr Pepper languished in fifth place with a mere $15 million in annual sales.', ""In other words, Dr Pepper beat Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola to market by one year and eight years, respectively. But Coca-Cola's business was nearly 36 times larger than Dr Pepper's more than 70 years later. And even Pepsi-Cola was nearly 12 times bigger."", 'By the 1960s, it would have seemed as though Coca-Cola and Pepsi had built an insurmountable moat around their businesses -- otherwise known as a competitive advantage. But that all changed with a pivotal court case in 1963.', ""Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola were working with hundreds of independent bottling companies -- that's still true today, with companies such as Coca-Cola Consolidated earning profits by working with Coca-Cola. These two soda giants made bottling companies sign agreements that they wouldn't work with their cola rivals. This left Dr Pepper with meager opportunities to expand. Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola had already locked down most of the bottlers."", ""However, in 1963, a federal court ruled that Dr Pepper was not a cola since the drink didn't contain any kola nut. That loophole allowed the Texas beverage company to sign deals with the same bottling companies used by Coca-Cola and Pepsi. By 1977, Dr Pepper had sales of $227 million, according to the Texas State Historical Society."", ""For those keeping score, that's an 18.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for Dr Pepper from 1961 through 1977. That's an enviable CAGR for any growth stock."", 'Dr Pepper started gaining market share in the carbonated beverage market following the court ruling, and it continues to gain market share even to this day.', ""According to Statista, Keurig Dr Pepper had 21.3% market share in 2022, trailing PepsiCo's 24.7% market share by only a hair. Through the first three quarters of 2023, sales volume for Keurig Dr Pepper's drinks fell 0.9% year over year. By comparison, sales volume for Pepsi's beverages in North America fell by 4.5% during roughly the same period, meaning Keurig Dr Pepper gained a little more ground toward second place."", ""There are some high-level takeaways to this story. Investment advisors will often point out the desirability of finding first-movers in a growing industry and finding companies with competitive advantages. But as I've laid out here, being first to market didn't lead to enormous success for Dr Pepper for the first 70 years. Moreover, Coca-Cola and Pepsi did have a competitive advantage with bottlers but this went away following a single court ruling."", ""Therefore, the high-level takeaway here is that investors need to do more research when it comes to a business -- being a first-mover isn't enough. Moreover, competitive advantages are great but many are finite. Investors consequently need to be aware of risks even with strong businesses."", 'Drilling down further to a more specific takeaway for Keurig Dr Pepper stock, the company surprisingly still has a relatively large opportunity to exploit today -- six decades after the infamous court case that catalyzed its growth.', 'Consider how big international beverage sales are for Pepsi and Coca-Cola. In the third quarter of 2023, PepsiCo generated nearly $7.2 billion in beverage sales in North America and around $2.9 billion in beverage sales internationally. For its part, Coca-Cola had international revenue of $6.9 billion in its third quarter or nearly 63% of its total revenue.', 'By comparison, Keurig Dr Pepper had just $523 million in international net sales in its third quarter, less than 14% of its total net sales and a fraction of competitors Coca-Cola and PepsiCo.', 'As Keurig Dr Pepper CEO Bob Gamgort said on the company\'s Q3 earnings call, ""Our international segment has become a scaled contributor to the overall portfolio with significant growth runway ahead.""', ""Keurig Dr Pepper might not be a market-beating stock opportunity today -- its overall growth is tepid right now. However, the company's international business is growing nicely and could provide some upside for patient investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Keurig Dr Pepper right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Keurig Dr Pepper, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Keurig Dr Pepper wasn't one of them.

The down move in January follows a double-digit gain in December. The volatility in its share price reflects the market's sentiment toward interest rate-sensitive stocks."", ""Whirlpool's exposure to the interest rate cycle comes from its reliance on the U.S. housing market. North America is the company's highest-margin region and biggest revenue generator. As such, North America generated more than 5 times the segment profit of its next-largest profit-generating region, Latin America, in 2023. Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) came in a distant third, with almost 20 times less profit."", 'As readers know, rising interest rates result in higher monthly mortgage payments, slow the housing market and, in turn, slow discretionary demand for household appliances.', ""Since the Federal Reserve hasn't reversed its rate hikes, Whirlpool continues struggling to generate growth. In fact, management's guidance for 2024 calls for flat like-for-like sales in 2023, with an ongoing earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin of 6.8%, similar to 2023. This comes as the company was forced to pull forward promotional activity in response to weakening end markets."", 'CEO Marc Bitzer noted that Whirpool\'s overall margin performance was below its initial expectations in 2023, and ""we were not able to reduce our inventories fast enough, which negatively impacted our full-year cash flow.""', 'Bitzer said, ""Obviously, these results were impacted by a still unfavorable housing cycle in 2023. The rapid and steep increase of U.S. mortgage rates led essentially to a freeze of existing home sales.""', ""The company enters 2024 facing challenging near-term conditions, and the results and full-year 2024 guidance released at the end of January reminded investors of the stock's near-term risk.\xa0That said, the interest rate cycle will turn at some point, possibly this year, as inflation data appears to be moderating. That will help Whirlpool's sales."", ""The company also continues this year to take $300 million to $400 million out of its costs, following $800 million in 2023. In addition, it's on track to contribute its European business to forming a new company with an Arcelik subsidiary (Whirlpool will take a 25% stake in the new company) by the end of April."", ""The deal will help Whirlpool's management focus on its core North American market, and management expects to exit 2024 with its North American business generating 10% EBIT margins, compared to 8.4% in 2023. It points to a company that could recover strongly in 2024, provided the interest rate cycle turns sooner rather than later, and its valuation (less than 8 times forward estimated earnings with a dividend yield of 63%) is compelling."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Whirlpool right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Whirlpool, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Whirlpool wasn't one of them.

We will also discuss current market dynamics and our near-term outlook. With that being said, I would now like to turn the call over to Peter."", ""Peter Vanacker: Thank you, David, and welcome to all of you. We appreciate you joining us today as we discuss our fourth quarter and full year 2023 results. Let's begin as we always do, with our safety results on Slide 3. During 2023, our employees and contractors demonstrated their commitment to outstanding safety performance. LYBs total recordable injury rate was 0.14, which is approximately 20% lower than the average of the prior three years. I want to congratulate our APS segments where injuries were 38% lower than 2022, a significant improvement from historical levels. We always use safety performance as a leading indicator of operational excellence and business performance. But there is no greater value than seeing every member of our team return home to their families every day in the same health has when they began to work their working day."", 'So turn to Slide four to discuss our financial results. 2023 was another challenging year for petrochemicals. While energy prices moderated in an environment of geopolitical unrest, markets were extremely cautious due to uncertainty about inflation and the potential for a more pronounced downturn in economic activity. Reported GDP growth in U.S. and China improved relative to 2022, the growth in petrochemicals was far below norms for our industry. Against that backdrop, LYB delivered earnings of $8.65 per share with an EBITDA of $5.2 billion. Cash generation was exceptional, and resulted in $4.9 billion of cash from operations. We have a highly efficient cash conversion ratio of 98%. We ended the year with $7.6 billion of liquidity supported by a strong investment grade balance sheet.', ""And we exceeded our cost of capital with an 11% return on invested capital. In March of last year, we successfully launched our new strategy at our Capital Markets Day in New York. Now let's turn to Slide five and briefly review the strategy. Our goal was to create focus, clarity, and alignments about direction LyondellBasell would be moving over the next five years and provide a clear vision of what the company would look like in 2027. Our strategy is built around three pillars, growing and upgrading the core, building a profitable circular and low carbon solutions business and stepping up performance and culture. In growing and upgrading the core, we are investing in businesses that fit with our competitive advantages and long-term strategy."", 'Our circular and low carbon solutions business is driving leadership in circularity and addressing the massive demand for these products from our customers and society. In the third pillar, we are transforming the culture of LYB to embed a more comprehensive view of value creation, while continuing to recognize that stringent cost management is vital in our industry. On Slide six, we highlight our progress on our strategy in 2023 and the work underway over the next few years towards over 2027 goals. In just 10 months, since launching our strategy last March, LyondellBasell has unlocked nearly 1/3 of the $3 billion of incremental normalized EBITDA that we are targeting for 2027. The successful startup of the PO/TBA plant this year is a major step forward in growing and upgrading our core by adding approximately $450 million to our normalized EBITDA.', ""And I'm very pleased to report that our value enhancement program is far exceeding our initial expectations. In 2023, the VEP achieved a year end run rate of more than $400 million of midcycle recurring annual EBITDA improvements, Michael will share more details on the progress of the VEP in a few moments. As shown on the slide, we have numerous workstreams underway to build towards our strategic goals of $2 billion of incremental normalized EBITDA by 2025, and a total of $3 billion by 2027. With the announced sale of the ethylene oxide and derivatives business to Ineos for $700 million, we are redirecting resources away from non-core businesses. The deal we announced in January to acquire 35% of NATPET in Saudi Arabia for approximately $500 million is just one example of how we are growing our core cost advantaged olefins, and polyolefins businesses."", ""We're making great strides and building strong foundations for our circular and low carbon solutions business. In 2023, we took a final investment decision for our first tranche of advanced recycling capacity in Germany, using our proprietary catalytic MoReTec technology. And we are building partnerships to source waste plastic to supply our app in Germany, while also securing waste plastic in Houston to supply our next investment an advanced recycling capacity. And the VEP program is not a one-time initiative, Michael will describe our increased targets for 2024 and beyond. While we have a lot of work ahead of us, I want to congratulate our team on the substantial progress we achieved on our strategic journey in 2023, ensuring a robust platform for longer term value creation and positive leverage to any market turnarounds."", ""On Slide seven, let's take a look at the steps ahead to deliver on our goals. We will continue to grow and upgrade our core businesses by focusing on advantaged feedstocks in growing markets, where LYB can build or extend our leading market position. Our new joint venture in Saudi Arabia is one example of how we will do this. As we add new positions, we will continue to review our portfolio for businesses and assets that are not aligned with our long-term strategy. The divestiture of EO and derivatives business, the sale of our Australian polypropylene business. The shutdown of a polypropylene line in Italy and the exit of the refining business for all examples of how we are sharpening the focus of our business portfolio. The rapid progress of the LYB value enhancement program also contributes to our growth through low-cost capacity debottlenecks and productivity improvements."", ""We're making good progress on building the foundations for our circular and low carbon solutions business as we work towards our goal of $500 million of incremental EBITDA by 2027 and $1 billion by 2030. And our VEP is not only delivering growth and productivity, the VEP also supports the third pillar of our strategy to step up performance and culture by instilling a value-based mindset across the company. With numerous initiatives to improve margins through customer and commercial excellence embedded in the VEP. And our work is to transform our advance polymer solutions business is also an important part of our work to step up performance and culture. All of our progress is supported by our foundations of efficient cash generation, disciplined capital allocation, and our investment grade balance sheet."", ""We're leveraging partnerships where it fits to achieve growth with capital efficiency. And we're pursuing a very value focused investment program. And we remain steadfast in our support for a secure, competitive and growing dividends as part of our commitment to competitive shareholder returns. And now, I will turn the call over to Michael to discuss the details of our financial progress."", ""Michael McMurray: Thank you, Peter. And good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide eight and let's take a look at the progress of our value enhancement program. As Peter mentioned, LYBs value enhancement program far exceeded our initial expectations in 2023. When we launched the program, we thought we could achieve a 2023 year-end run rate of $150 million of midcycle recurring annual EBITDA improvement. With high engagement and rapid execution, our team achieved a run rate of more than $400 million by year-end 2023. We have a strong management system in place for our VEP program. Our team has screened more than 13,000 ideas, and more than 1900 of these ideas have advanced to the execution ready stage of our process. By the end of 2023, we executed on approximately 450 of these initiatives."", ""Our system is robust and disciplined, and our internal and external auditors have validated our processes. We currently believe this effort will add a total of $600 million of recurring annual EBITDA by the end of 2024 and up to a billion dollars by the end of 2025. This is a significant increase from our initial target of $750 million that we announced last March, driven by the enthusiastic [indiscernible] of our colleagues and the tangible results that we have delivered so far. The LYV value enhancement program is providing meaningful contributions to our strategic financial goals. And we'll continue to do so as we move forward. On Slide nine, let me share more details about the progress on our VEP program during 2023. Our targets for the program are described as year-end run rates relative to 2021 volumes, and using average margins from 2017 to 2019, a time period that provides a good approximation of mid cycle margins."", 'Through more than 450 initiatives, we generated over $300 million of VEP EBITDA from the program based on 2023 margins. This reflects the net recurring improvements throughout the year relative to 2021 volume, product mix and cost. Now, let me highlight a few of the initiatives from last year. At our Lake Charles integrated polyethylene joint venture, we automated controls for a water treatment unit that reduced manual operations and water consumption. With a small investment, we were able to reduce our LYB share of cost by $800,000 annually. In our oxy fuels business, our cost advantaged U.S. production is exported in vessels to markets around the world. We worked with one of our terminal providers to encourage their investment in a vapor recovery system that allowed LYB to double decile loading rates to reduce demerge cost and vapor emissions for a net recurring benefit of $1 million per year.', 'By investing resources to learn more about the needs of our customers, our polymer product development team allocated resources for new products to serve demanding applications and wired cable sheathing for subsea infrastructure markets. This initiative improved recording profitability by at least $300,000 per year. We hope these examples provides you some insight into the hundreds of small initiatives that we have that we expect to add up to $1 billion of midcycle recurring annual EBITDA to LYBs run rate by the end of 2025. Please turn to Slide 10. And let me begin by highlighting the outstanding Cash Generation from our business portfolio during 2023. LYB generated a total of $4.9 billion of cash from operating activities over the past year.', ""Cash on hand increased to $3.4 billion at the end of the fourth quarter. During 2023, we achieved cash conversion of 98% well above our long-term target of 80%. Our cash conversion was bolstered by working capital reduction of approximately $700 million during the fourth quarter. The majority of the working capital benefit was from lower receivables and inventories. We expect our working capital needs will increase during the first quarter. Our efficient cash generation allowed the company to return more than $1.8 billion to LyondellBasell shareholders in 2023. This represents 53% of our $3.4 billion of free cash flow for the year. Let's continue with Slide 11 and review the details of our capital allocation over the past year. As Peter mentioned, we are committed to discipline capital allocation as we execute our strategy and maintain our robust investment grade balance sheet."", 'During 2023 cash from operating activities fully funded $1.6 billion in dividends $210 million in share repurchases and our capital investment program. In May, we increased our quarterly dividend by 5%, marking the 13th consecutive year of annual dividend growth. This year, we invested 1.5 billion in capital expenditures. We reached an important milestone with the successful startup of our new PO/TBA asset in 2023. With the completion of this world scale project, our future capital expenditures will be increasingly focused on a portfolio of smaller projects to advance our strategy. This includes investments in small profit generating projects, integrated hubs for circular solutions, and hundreds of initiatives within the value enhancement program.', 'We ended the year with $3.4 billion of cash and short-term investments, then $7.6 billion of cash and available liquidity. In line with our strategic focus on leadership and sustainability. We issued our initial inaugural green bond for $500 million LYBs robust balance sheet positions as well to move forward on our long term strategy during the year ahead. One last comment. We added over a billion dollars of cash to our balance sheet in 2023 as a result of strong execution amid challenging market conditions. As a result, we are carrying about two times our stated minimum of 1.5 billion. We have built a bit more cash because of the challenging market conditions and uncertain economic outlook that we have been navigating. That said our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged.', 'And we remain committed to returning 70% of our free cash flow to shareholders over the long-term. Now I would like to provide an overview of the quarterly results for each of our segments on Page 12. LYBs business portfolio delivered $910 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter. Our lower results reflect a significant decline in gasoline crack spreads in seasonally lower demand during the fourth quarter. Lower gasoline cracks bedspreads negatively impacted our refining results oxy fuels in the intermediates and Driftwood segment and the value of coproduct fuels and olefins and polyolefins Americas. During the quarter, lower ethane in energy cost and increased polyethylene exports benefitted our O&P Americas business. Overall, olefins and polyolefins demand remained soft, particularly in Europe, where utilization rates remained low.', ""Lower demand and higher raw material costs negatively impacted our advanced polymer solution segment. Across the portfolio, a noncash LIFO inventory valuation charge decreased pre tax for quarter results by approximately $55 million. As a reminder, the LIFO impact reflects changes in inventory valuation over the full year and it's not necessarily limited to fourth quarter valuations. Before we discuss our segment results in detail, let me discuss our capital expenditure plans for 2024, our capital plan includes approximately $800 billion for profit generating growth projects, and $1.3 billion of sustaining investment to keep our assets running safely and reliably. The increased profit generating capital includes investments to grow our circular and low carbon solutions business, as well as investments to lower the carbon footprint of our existing asset base, particularly in Europe."", ""Funding required to drive our value enhancement program is included in our CapEx plan. We expect our 2024 effective tax rate will be approximately 20%. And our cash tax rate will be a few percentage points higher. In the appendix of the slide deck, we have provided additional 2024 modeling information, including impacts for major plant maintenance costs associated with the exit from our refining business than other useful financial metrics. With that, I'll turn the call over to Ken. Ken?"", ""Ken Lane: Thank you, Michael. Let's begin the segment discussions on Slide 13 with the performance of our olefins and polyolefins Americas segments. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $604 million. During the quarter a significant decrease in co-product values negatively impacted olefin's margins. Polyolefins prices were stable domestically, while a very strong export volume led to some lower pricing in our overall portfolio. Strong demand from export markets continues to drive increased polyethylene volumes, and we didn't see the typical seasonal slowdown. We operated our assets at approximately 85% of nameplate capacity to match market demand and continued to actively manage working capital. Fourth quarter EBITDA included a LIFO inventory valuation benefit of approximately $75 million."", ""During the first quarter, we expect polyethylene prices to remain firm with modest improvements in domestic demand and ongoing strength in export markets. We anticipate ethane and energy costs will remain favorable for our assets in the region, providing some margin tailwinds. Overall, we expect to operate our O&P Americas assets at an average of approximately 80% during the first quarter, slightly lower than fourth quarter 2023 due to plant maintenance. In December, we signed two new renewable power purchase agreements. With these agreements, we've achieved almost 90% of our goal to procure at least 50% of our global power from renewable sources by 2030. In total, we have 12 agreements in place, representing more than 1.3 gigawatts of renewable power capacity."", 'As we mentioned, last quarter, we announced our investment in Cyclyx, a joint venture with Agilyx and ExxonMobi. This partnership is focused on increasing plastic waste, recycling infrastructure to improve circularity. In December Cyclyx announced the final investment decision to build the first Cyclyx circularity center in Houston. The circularity center will focus on increasing plastic waste recycling options, through better sourcing and sorting of plastic waste. The facility will have the capacity to produce more than 130,000 tons of plastic feedstock per year for advanced and mechanical recycling and is expected to start off in 2025. Now, please turn to Slide 14 to review the performance of our olefins and polyolefins. Europe, Asia and international segment.', 'During the quarter, European markets remained weak with softer seasonal demand and lower consumer confidence. Polymer prices were modestly higher with an improved sales mix and stable naphtha feedstock costs. Due to the low demand, we operated our assets at rates of approximately 65% during the quarter. The combined impact of the weak demand and low rates lead to a fourth quarter EBITDA loss of $87 million. As we move into 2024, we expect weak European demand will persist with ongoing consumer uncertainty. Nonetheless, we are seeing modest improvements in orders as some customers begin to restock and seek local supply as imports moving through the Red Sea are disrupted. We expect to operate our European assets at a rate of 75% during the first quarter.', ""Demand in China remains muted as customers manage inventories with the approach of the lunar new year amid a slow economic environment. As Peter mentioned earlier, we are making great progress on our strategy to grow and upgrade our core businesses. Our recent announcement to acquire a 35% share of naphtha reflects our focus on assets that have long-term advantage. But we're also moving away from the assets that can't deliver long-term competitiveness, as demonstrated by last year's decision to close one of our two polypropylene assets in Brindisi, Italy. We're also making good progress with building our circular and low carbon business. During the fourth quarter, we made the final investment decision to build our first commercial catalytic advanced recycling plant at our Wesseling Germany site."", ""With an estimated capacity of 50,000 tons per year this plant will utilize our differential MoReTec advanced recycling technology. And just like in Houston, we are collaborating with partners to secure plastic waste feedstock in Germany. In December, we acquired a minority share of Source One plastics, a plastic waste sourcing company in Germany. Source One will provide the majority of the processed plastic waste feedstock to our new MoReTec assets. Through our integrated hub model, we are establishing an integrated circular value chain at scale. Now please turn to Slide 15. And let's take a closer look at our new NATPET joint venture. A few weeks ago, we announced our agreement to acquire a 35% share of national petrochemical industrial company or where NATPET from Alujain Corporation and Yanbu, Saudi Arabia."", 'The joint venture is a great example of how we are growing our core businesses with advantage of the assets by leveraging LYBs leading technology and global market reach. Today, NATPET consists of 400,000 tons of propane dehydrogenation or PDH capacity that converts cost advantage Saudi propane into propylene monomer to feed a 400,000 ton polypropylene unit utilizing LYBs proprietary Spheripol technology. The assets have been operational since 2009 and have generated an annual average of U.S.$155 million in EBITDA over the five years from 2018 to 2022. NATPETs PP products serve a diverse range of customers across global markets. As part of the transaction, LYB will leverage our global marketing network to sell a majority of the product on behalf of net pet creating a new revenue stream for LYB.', 'NATPETs assets are first quartile that have the advantage of sourcing local Saudi propane feedstock at a discount to global prices. Also our investment in NATPET provides a platform for continued growth. In 2022, NATPET was awarded a new feedstock allocation that could support additional capacity. The partners are evaluating a second PDH PP asset on the site that would benefit from meaningful synergies. Previously, Alujain selected LYB sphere zone polypropylene technology for the potential expansion. The high-performance polypropylene solutions enabled by our proprietary sphere zone technology provides the potential to expand NATPETs production into new applications and markets. We expect our investment in NATPET will exceed our 12% target for unlevered internal rates of return.', 'The additional capacity could provide even higher returns. We expect the transaction will close in the first half of 2024 following regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. With that, I will turn the call over to Kim.', 'Kim Foley: Thank you, Ken. Please turn to Slide 16, as we take a look at our intermediates and derivatives segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $265 million. Oxyfuel margins declined due to a significant decrease in gasoline CAC spreads as well as an increased supply of oxyfuels after industry downtime during the third quarter. Direct margins were pressured due to higher benzene feedstock costs, LIFO inventory charges were approximately $95 million. In the fourth quarter we recognized an impairment of $192 million related to our PO/SM joint venture in the Netherlands. We operated our assets at a rate of approximately 70% during the fourth quarter due to low demand as well as planned and unplanned downtime across most businesses.', 'As we begin the first quarter oxyfuel margins remain similar to fourth quarter levels. We anticipate higher volumes across the segment after downtime in the fourth quarter and plan to operate across the IMD segment at approximately 75% in the first quarter. These operating rates reflect the impact of the recent winter freeze event, resulting in unplanned downtime at our U.S. Gulf Coast assets. In December, we announced an agreement to divest our ethylene oxide and derivative business to Ineos for $700 million. As Peter mentioned earlier, we are taking decisive actions to grow and upgrade that businesses and assets that align with our long-term strategy. While exiting businesses where LYB does not have a path to a leading position. We expect the transaction will close in the second quarter following regulatory approvals, and other closing conditions.', ""Please note that the agreed transaction price is pre-tax, and that these assets are heavily depreciated. Now let's turn to Slide 17 and discuss the results of the refining segment. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $51 million, including charges of $40 million of LIFO inventory valuation refining margins compressed due to lower gasoline crack spreads. During the quarter we operated the refinery at 85% of capacity due to planned and unplanned downtime, with an average crude rate of 230,000 barrels per day. In the near term, we expect gasoline crack spreads will improve offset by lower distillate cracks. We plan to operate the refinery directionally 80% of capacity in the first quarter, including a planned Coker outage with an estimated EBITDA impact of $50 million."", 'Our team remains highly focused on safe and reliable operations as we continue to run our refining assets through no later than the end of the first quarter of 2025. With that, I will turn the call over to Torkel.', ""Torkel Rhenman: Thank you, Kim. Now let's review the results of our advanced polymer solutions segment on slide 18. Fourth quarter EBITDA declined to $12 million. Margins were pressured by higher raw material cost and volumes decreased due to seasonally lower fourth quarter demand with a slowdown in December due to customer outages. Likely inventory valuations benefits were $10 million. Looking ahead, we see signs of market recovery and expect modest demand improvement in the first quarter. This year, we continued our transformation journey with advanced polymer solutions. APS results in 2023 were lower than 2022 and not reflected of our financial expectations for this business. Success with APS customers is largely based on project-by-project qualification."", ""Today's underperformance is indicative of our low success rate in gaining new qualifications during prior quarters. However, our laser focus on our customers is gaining momentum. We have seen a step up in our recent surveys for customer satisfaction. With an organization that is focused and accountable. We're making steady progress as we rebuild our project growth funnel. Our growth pipeline is already delivering. During the fourth quarter of 2023, volumes improved by 2.5% over the prior year. I want to congratulate the APS team for achieving record safety performance in 2023. I truly believe our customer focus, as measured by our recent customer satisfaction survey, our progress in refilling our growth funnel and our superior safety results reflects our attention to detail that provides a leading indicator for operational performance and eventual financial results."", 'With that, I will return the call back to Peter.', ""Peter Vanacker: Thanks, Torkel. I would like to thank the entire LyondellBasell team for delivering such resilient results during a very challenging year. To close out on the segments, let's turn to Slide 19 and discuss the results for our technology business on behalf of Jim Seward. During the fourth quarter, licensing revenue moderated after exceptionally strong results in the third quarter due to the timing of licensing milestones. Nonetheless, EBITDA for the segment exceeded the fourth quarter of the prior year. Fourth quarter catalyst volumes were higher than any quarter since the third quarter of 2022. First quarter results for the technology segments were expected to improve due to increased licensing revenue and a further rise in catalyst volumes compared to the fourth quarter of 2023."", ""As Ken mentioned earlier, we will utilize our proprietary MoReTec technology as we build our first commercial scale advanced recycling plant in Germany. I'm very proud of the work our R&D team embarked on years ago to develop this differential and advantage technology from lab to commercial scale. Let me now summarize our outlook with Slide 20. As we begin 2024, the majority of our businesses are continuing to face the slow demand seen in the fourth quarter of 2023. But we are seeing a few early signs of improvement. Our North American O&P business is seeing modest demand improvements. In Europe, order trends were improving from a very low level as our O&P customers begin to pursue modest restocking. For the year, we expect normal seasonal demand improvements to begin near the end of the first quarter and continue through the summer."", 'As we progress through the second half of the year, we expect demand to benefit from moderating interest rates and reduced inflation. Durable goods are a critical market for LYBs products. Demand for durable goods lacked the economy during 2022 and 2023. As markets digested the extraordinary high levels of consumer activity that prevailed during pandemic era stimulus. We expect that moderating interest rates, reduced inflation and infrastructure-related stimulus spending will begin to support a gradual return to a healthier demand for durable goods during the second half of this year. China is the largest market for chemicals, exceeding North America and Europe combined, and we continue to watch closely for targeted stimulus and other measures that could drive improved economic growth in China.', ""In the meantime, LYB will continue to advance on our strategic goals. We are actively managing our portfolio to grow and upgrade our core businesses. We will continue to see actions supporting the growth of regional hubs that will serve as the engines for our profitable circular and low-carbon solutions business. And our work to embed value creation into our corporate culture will continue to deliver results through our value enhancement program.

Its long-term goal is for profits to rise between 13% and 16% per year, due in large part to the growth in its Medicare business."", ""And that's not an unrealistic growth rate by any means. The company reported earnings in January, and for 2023 its earnings from operations grew 14% year over year to $32.4 billion. UnitedHealth sees potential in many opportunities within healthcare, including value-based care, health technology, health financial services, and pharmacy services as well."", ""The company's Optum business, for instance, focuses on the services side and helps employers, health systems, and other customers improve the care that they offer while also reducing costs for them.

The company has long relied on innovation to drive growth in its business and in the categories it serves, which helps to keep it at the top of the industry.', ""And the second quarter of P&G's fiscal 2024 was another good one, but there were two wrinkles that investors need to understand."", ""In the second quarter of P&G's fiscal 2024, sales rose 3% year over year. That may sound like a modest number, and it is, but it is a good showing for a consumer staples company. Slow and steady is the normal pace. The big boost across the company's five main businesses came from price increases, which increased sales by 4 percentage points. The big negative in the quarter was the impact of foreign exchange rates, which cost the company 1 percentage point."", ""Notably, despite price increases, volume was flat overall. This is important because P&G, like all consumer staples companies, has been increasing prices at a fairly rapid clip over the past year or so to offset the impact of inflation on its own business. Effectively, it has passed its rising costs on to consumers. While there's nothing unusual about this tactic, the price hikes were larger and more frequent this time around. The normal reaction from consumers is to buy less when prices rise. So P&G being able to maintain volume across its portfolio even as it increases prices (again) was really good news."", 'There were some nuances to the quarter, like Chinese customers boycotting Japanese brands such as P&G SK-II cosmetics. The company expects this to be temporary. But there was also a non-cash charge that needs to be examined.', ""On an adjusted basis, P&G's earnings rose 16% year over year. But on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, the company's earnings fell 12%. That's a big difference and it is worth examining why the difference exists. Basically, the company's adjusted numbers pulled out items it believes are one-time in nature. The big one in the quarter was a $1.3 billion before-tax impairment of the carrying value of Gillette. As the company explained in its latest quarterly report:"", 'The impairment charge arose from a reduction in the estimated fair value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset due to a higher discount rate, weakening of several currencies relative to the U.S. dollar and the impact of the non-core restructuring program described above. This impairment charge adjusted the carrying value of the Gillette indefinite-lived intangible asset to fair value.', 'The non-core restructuring program noted in the comment is centered around P&G shifting from producing products within certain markets to importing products made elsewhere into the market. What exactly does all of this mean?', ""For starters, when a company buys another company it generally pays a premium. To simplify things, that premium gets lumped into intangible assets that are tied into things like brand names. Writing down the value of Gillette by $1.3 billion suggests that Gillette isn't worth quite as much as the company had once hoped."", ""That's not shocking given the changes that have taken place in the grooming space -- namely, the increasing popularity of growing a beard. Gillette also faces upstart brands offering lower-priced razors online, in stores, and via subscriptions. In fact, in 2019 the company wrote down the value of the business by $8 billion, so the most recent write down is relatively modest."", ""That said, the current write down suggests that the shaving market is still very competitive and Gillette just doesn't have the same dominance it once had. This is not good news, though Gillette still produces significant cash flow for P&G."", ""The shift from producing in a country to importing into that country is also relevant. That's a bit different from the previous approach and highlights that operating in some markets, predominantly smaller emerging economies, has been harder than P&G expected. There are good reasons for this, including difficulty in sourcing ingredients because of government-imposed monetary constraints (in plain English, P&G can't get access within the country to the U.S. dollars it needs to buy things). But, still, it means the approach management took didn't work out as planned."", ""The one-time items in P&G's fiscal second quarter shouldn't dissuade investors from owning the stock. It remains an industry giant with a strong business. However, it is a reminder that even industry bellwethers aren't perfect."", ""All in, investors should probably continue to expect headwinds for Gillette and keep an eye on emerging markets. They offer more growth opportunities, but as seen this quarter, this can come with higher risks. So while there's probably no reason to worry, you shouldn't ignore the one-off items that were effectively hidden by adjusted earnings."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Procter & Gamble right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Procter & Gamble, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Procter & Gamble wasn't one of them.

And indeed, this is the biggest part of its business, with beverage sales in North America accounting for 31% of its total net sales.', ""However, nearly 50% of Pepsi's operating income (through the first three quarters of 2023) came from its Frito-Lay division in North America. This segment owns well-known potato and corn chip brands such as Fritos, Lays, Doritos, and Ruffles."", 'Beyond this, Pepsi also owns Quaker Foods, maker of oatmeals, cereals, snacks, and more.', 'Finally, Pepsi sells its drinks, snacks, and foods both in the U.S. and internationally.', ""Investors who dropped $1,000 into the stock five years ago have more than $1,500 today, or nearly $1,800 if they reinvested dividends along the way. That's not bad at all. But unfortunately, that's less than investors would have had if they had just invested in the S&P 500 index."", ""That's right -- PepsiCo stock has underperformed the market over the last five years. Here's why, and also what investors can expect over the next five years."", ""Pepsi stock has underperformed the market simply because its business hasn't grown enough to support a market-beating stock performance. That's how the stock market generally works -- business growth translates to stock-price appreciation over extended time periods."", 'Pepsi is growing. The company keeps finding ways to grow both organically and through acquisitions. Moreover, management is always looking to improve operations to squeeze out higher profitability.', ""However, as the chart below shows, Pepsi stock has gone up at a faster pace than its business has grown. And that's a tough situation for investors hoping for market-beating results."", ""For investors looking for a strong business with predictable dividends, Pepsi could absolutely be a stock worth owning. The company increases its revenue most years. And it's paid and increased its dividend for 51 consecutive years, making it one of the few Dividend Kings out there."", ""Investors need to be aware that the dividend is central to the capital-allocation strategy of PepsiCo's management. This is a good thing, because investors can rely on Pepsi to pay a growing dividend without fail. Income investors appreciate the consistency. However, at this point, almost all of the company's earnings are used to pay dividends, as seen in the chart below."", ""In other words, PepsiCo returns so much money to shareholders that it doesn't have much left over to invest in the business. However, that's not necessarily a criticism. Indeed, even if Pepsi were to try to invest in growth, it's doubtful how much growth it would find. After all, at its size, even finding a new billion-dollar business would barely move the needle. Therefore, I think management is pursuing the correct capital-allocation strategy."", 'For this reason, I doubt that PepsiCo stock will outperform the market average over the next five years. The company will likely post modest annual top-line growth. I expect it will continue earning a healthy profit. And much of this profit will be returned to shareholders through its dividend and share repurchases.', ""With this combination, I believe PepsiCo stock extremely likely to post positive returns over the long term. And that certainly counts for something. But for investors looking to only pick stocks with a high chance of outperforming the market average, it's likely best to look for other investment opportunities."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in PepsiCo right now?', 'Before you buy stock in PepsiCo, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and PepsiCo wasn't one of them.

But one year earlier, Charles Alderton had served up his first glass of Dr Pepper in Waco, Texas -- a carbonated beverage owned by Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ: KDP) today. This makes Dr Pepper older than Coca-Cola.', ""With its first-mover advantage and tasty product, one would think that Dr Pepper went toe-to-toe with Coca-Cola in the early days. However, its sales really underwhelmed for a long time, and companies such as PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) and Canada Dry were Coke's true competition for many decades."", 'In 1961, Coca-Cola had net sales of $537 million and was way out in first place in the carbonated soda industry. PepsiCo (or The Pepsi-Cola Company as it was known at the time) was in a distant third place with sales of $174 million. However, Dr Pepper languished in fifth place with a mere $15 million in annual sales.', ""In other words, Dr Pepper beat Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola to market by one year and eight years, respectively. But Coca-Cola's business was nearly 36 times larger than Dr Pepper's more than 70 years later. And even Pepsi-Cola was nearly 12 times bigger."", 'By the 1960s, it would have seemed as though Coca-Cola and Pepsi had built an insurmountable moat around their businesses -- otherwise known as a competitive advantage. But that all changed with a pivotal court case in 1963.', ""Both Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola were working with hundreds of independent bottling companies -- that's still true today, with companies such as Coca-Cola Consolidated earning profits by working with Coca-Cola. These two soda giants made bottling companies sign agreements that they wouldn't work with their cola rivals. This left Dr Pepper with meager opportunities to expand. Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola had already locked down most of the bottlers."", ""However, in 1963, a federal court ruled that Dr Pepper was not a cola since the drink didn't contain any kola nut.
