Its revenues and earnings in the quarter are expected to have improved on a year-over-year basis.In second-quarter 2022, Schwab’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were aided by increased net interest income. Also, lower fee waivers and growth in brokerage account numbers acted as tailwinds. However, higher expenses were a headwind.The company does not have an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two and lagged in two of the trailing four quarters.The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS Surprise The Charles Schwab Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseThe Charles Schwab Corporation price-eps-surprise | The Charles Schwab Corporation QuoteSchwab’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for SCHW’s third-quarter earnings has been revised 1% higher to $1.05. The estimate indicates an increase of 25% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for third-quarter earnings is $1.02.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $5.40 billion, which suggests an increase of 18.1% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for total revenues is $5.38 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 17.8%.SCHW projects the third-quarter top line to grow 18-19% on a year-over-year basis, given the “ongoing success with clients” and a robust net interest margin.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s check the factors that are likely to have impacted Schwab’s third-quarter performance.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q3After witnessing a gradual normalization in the second half of 2021, trading activities rebounded in the first half of 2022, with the trend continuing into the third quarter. Certain developments, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the continued supply-chain disruptions, led to uncertainty among investors.Also, fears of a severe economic slowdown amid the ultra-aggressive stance of the central banks across the globe to control inflation drove client activity and trading volumes in the third quarter.Driven by the rise in volatility, investors seemed somewhat interested in entering the markets.In July, SCHW opened 278,000 new brokerage accounts. In August, brokerage accounts opened were 332,000.While Schwab’s trading performance is expected to have been robust in the quarter under review, supported by higher volatility and client activity, trading revenues are not expected to have improved significantly from the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter trading revenues is pegged at $862 million, which suggests a decline of 10.6% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for trading revenues is $1.09 billion.The consensus estimate for total client assets is pegged at $7.2 trillion, which indicates a decline of 5.1% on a year-over-year basis. However, the consensus estimate for average interest-earning assets of $598 billion suggests growth of 7.7% from the prior-year quarter’s reported level. Our estimate for average interest-earning assets is $678.2 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 22.3%.Thus, supported by the expected growth in interest-earning assets, along with higher interest rates, Schwab’s net interest revenues are likely to have been positively impacted. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest revenues is pegged at $2.83 billion, which suggests a year-over-year rise of 39.4%. Our estimate for the same is $2.51 billion, suggesting a rise of 23.7%.The consensus estimate for asset management and administration fees of $1.10 billion suggests no change from the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the same is $1.23 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 11.4%.Coming to expenses, Schwab’s operating expenses have been elevated in the past few quarters. Due to the persistent regulatory spending and strategic buyouts to drive efficiency, overall expenses are expected to have been high in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to our quantitative model, it cannot be conclusively predicted whether Schwab will be able to beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate this time. This is because it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is 0.00%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. While this increases the predictive power of ESP, we also need a positive ESP to be confident of an earnings surprise call.Stocks Worth a LookA few finance stocks, which you may want to consider, as these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases per our model, are Associated Banc-Corp ASB and LPL Financial LPLA.Associated Banc-Corp is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 earnings on Oct 20.

5,a07aedd0-d9be-396f-8844-ef545f2e8be8,NUE,2022-10-14,Earnings Preview: Nucor (NUE) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-nucor-nue-q3-140002281.html,1665669602,STORY,"['NUE', 'STLD']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when Nucor (NUE) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis steel company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $6.45 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -11.4%.Revenues are expected to be $10.06 billion, down 2.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 4.85% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Nucor?For Nucor, the Most Accurate Estimate is the same as the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that there are no recent analyst views which differ from what have been considered to derive the consensus estimate. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Nucor will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Nucor would post earnings of $8.91 per share when it actually produced earnings of $9.67, delivering a surprise of +8.53%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Nucor doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerSteel Dynamics (STLD), another stock in the Zacks Steel - Producers industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $4.97 for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +0.2%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.48 billion, up 7.7% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Steel Dynamics has been revised 0.6% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.This Earnings ESP, combined with its Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Steel Dynamics will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

6,0a60b4db-17e7-3755-9d23-47d4b97c2516,UNM,2022-10-14,3 Insurance Stocks With Decent Dividend Yield to Bank On,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-insurance-stocks-decent-dividend-153903284.html,1665675543,STORY,"['MFC.TO', 'UNM', 'CNA', 'MFC']","[Economic uncertainty worsened in the first half of 2022 due to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, a tight monetary policy undertaken by the Federal Reserve and high inflation. In the past year, the S&amp;P 500 index has declined 20.4%. Volatility is expected to continue in the remainder of 2022.Amid this, insurance players like CNA Financial Corporation CNA, Manulife Financial Corp MFC and Unum Group UNM are expected to brave industry headwinds. These have an impressive dividend history and are likely to yield promising returns. Dividends play an important role in limiting portfolio risk as well as market volatility. Regular dividend hikes also indicate profitability of the insurer.The insurance industry is benefiting from improved pricing, increased technology advancements, exposure growth and global expansion as well as an impressive solvency level. Prudent underwriting standards, lower mortality rates, redesigning and repricing of products and services and an improving rate environment should also add to the upside.Per the Global Insurance Market Index by Marsh, global commercial insurance prices increased 9% in the second quarter of 2022. This marked the 19th consecutive quarter in which composite pricing rose, continuing the longest run of increases since the inception of the index in 2012. Per Marsh, global property insurance pricing and casualty pricing increased 6% each on average in the second quarter of 2022. Pricing in financial and professional lines had the highest rate of increase across the major insurance product categories at 16%. Per Willis Towers Watson’s 2022 Insurance Marketplace Realities report, rates will continue to rise but by a small margin. Better pricing will help insurers write higher premiums and address claims payment prudently. Per Deloitte insights, global non-life premiums are estimated to grow 3.7% in 2022.Price hikes, operational strength, higher retention, strong renewal and the appointment of retail agents should help write higher premiums.With a rise in the number of aging population, the demand for retirement benefits is increasing. Per a report by IBISWorld, the $909 billion U.S. Life Insurance &amp; Annuities Market is expected to grow 2.5% in 2022. Increased vaccinations and economic growth potential instill confidence.The insurers remain exposed to catastrophe loss from natural disasters and weather-related events, which induce volatility in their underwriting results. Per Colorado State University (CSU), the 2022 above-average hurricane season may have 19 named storms, including nine hurricanes and four major hurricanes. This year’s hurricane season could be about 130% of the average season per CSU. Global estimated insured losses from natural catastrophes in the first half of 2022 were $35 billion, 22% above average of the past 10 years ($29 billion), per a report by Swiss Re Institute.Exposure growth, better pricing, prudent underwriting and favorable reserve development will help withstand the blow. Also, frequent occurrences of natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate.The interest rate environment has started to improve. The Fed declared the third consecutive 75 basis point increase in the Federal Funds rate. Currently, the interest rate is in the range of 3%-3.25%. Insurers, being direct beneficiaries of an improving rate environment, are poised to gain. To check high levels of inflation, the Fed will continue to rise interest rates, which will improve investment results.Banking on operational efficiency, which leads to a solid capital position, insurers continue to engage in strategic mergers and acquisitions to diversify their operations into new business lines and geography and deploy capital to enhance shareholder value.Insurers have increased investment in emerging technologies in a bid to drive efficiency, enhance cybersecurity, upgrade policy administration and claims systems as well as expand automation capabilities across the organization. Deloitte’s Global survey projects insurers’ technology budget to increase 13.7% in 2022.Story continuesBest 3 Dividend Stocks to WatchWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected three insurance stocks with a dividend yield of more than 2% and they have grown dividend over the past five years. These stocks also have a payout ratio of less than 60 and carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.CNA Financial, with a market capitalization of $10.2 billion, offers commercial P&amp;C insurance products, mainly across the United States. Riding on a compelling product portfolio, better retention, improving pricing, and new business growth, CNA Financial has been witnessing improvement in gross premium written since 2015, with each of the segments delivering improved gross premium written.Its strong balance sheet and cash flows enable CNA Financial to engage in shareholder-friendly moves like dividend hikes. The company’s quarterly dividend payment has witnessed an eight-year CAGR (2015-20222) of 6.1%. The current dividend yield of 4.2% is better than the industry average of 0.4%. In February 2022, CNA Financial’s board approved a 5% hike in the quarterly dividend. Simultaneously, CNA announced a special dividend of $2 per share, marking the eighth special dividend. CNA increased its dividend six times in the last five years. The property and casualty insurer’s payout ratio is 41, with a five-year annualized dividend growth rate of 5.6%. (Check CNA Financial’s dividend history here).CNA Financial Corporation Dividend Yield (TTM)CNA Financial Corporation Dividend Yield (TTM)CNA Financial Corporation dividend-yield-ttm | CNA Financial Corporation QuoteCNA Financial maintains a conservative capital structure, a leverage ratio of 22.6% and capital above target levels in support of ratings. By virtue of disciplined execution, as reflected in its strong underwriting results, and confidence in future earnings performances, the insurer has hiked its dividend over the past couple of years. CNA remains committed to returning more value to shareholders.Manulife Financial, with a market capitalization of $29.4 billion, is one of the three dominant life insurers within its domestic market and has rapidly growing operations in the United States and several Asian countries. The insurer’s strong Asia business and expanding wealth and asset management business poise it well for growth.MFC's current dividend yield of 6.7% betters the industry average of 4.2%. Manulife has a strong track record of delivering progressive dividend increases. The life insurer’s payout ratio is 41, with a five-year annualized dividend growth rate of 9.6%. Manulife Financial increased its dividend 14 times in the last five years. (Check Manulife Financial’s dividend history here)Manulife Financial Corp Dividend Yield (TTM)Manulife Financial Corp Dividend Yield (TTM)Manulife Financial Corp dividend-yield-ttm | Manulife Financial Corp QuoteA solid balance sheet, along with strong operational performance and the life insurer’s outlook for growth in the future, has enabled it to hike its dividend payout. In November 2021, MFC increased total dividend by 18%. It targets a 35-45% dividend payout over the medium term. Its Asia business is the major contributor to its earnings. New business growth in Asia has been aiding the operational results. MFC remains focused on ramping up growth in its highest potential businesses, and thus estimates these businesses to generate about 67% of total company core earnings by 2022.Unum Group, with a market capitalization of $8.1 billion, is ranked as the leading disability income writer and the second-largest writer of voluntary business in the United States. By virtue of sustained solid operational performance, favorable benefits experience as well as solid top-line growth in the core businesses, UNM witnessed favorable operating results across the majority of its insurance entities.

11,169d1068-f91e-3574-ab74-a8ec56892d76,TMO,2022-10-14,Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.'s (NYSE:TMO) Popularity With Investors Is Under Threat From Overpricing,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thermo-fisher-scientific-inc-nyse-140038772.html,1665669638,STORY,['TMO'],"[Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.'s (NYSE:TMO) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 26.4x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 13x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Thermo Fisher Scientific could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific peKeen to find out how analysts think Thermo Fisher Scientific's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is Thermo Fisher Scientific's Growth Trending?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Thermo Fisher Scientific's to be considered reasonable.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 13% decrease to the company's bottom line. Still, the latest three year period has seen an excellent 115% overall rise in EPS, in spite of its unsatisfying short-term performance. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a very good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 6.8% per annum as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.5% each year, which is noticeably more attractive.With this information, we find it concerning that Thermo Fisher Scientific is trading at a P/E higher than the market. Apparently many investors in the company are way more bullish than analysts indicate and aren't willing to let go of their stock at any price. There's a good chance these shareholders are setting themselves up for future disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayUsing the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Our examination of Thermo Fisher Scientific's analyst forecasts revealed that its inferior earnings outlook isn't impacting its high P/E anywhere near as much as we would have predicted. Right now we are increasingly uncomfortable with the high P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at significant risk and potential investors in danger of paying an excessive premium.Don't forget that there may be other risks.

Allen claims that shifting consumer preferences and behavior, the integration of life sciences and healthcare sector, rapidly evolving digital health technologies, new talent and care delivery models, and clinical innovation continue to be top of mind for healthcare executives globally. Some of the top healthcare stocks to buy in this context include Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

We are further attracted to its strong management team that has a stellar track record of deploying capital, and the founding family continues to own almost a quarter of the business.

14,ee1280cd-8099-3883-b057-589e5c4bfadb,USB,2022-10-14,Huge 1500-Point Swing on the Dow After Disappointing CPI,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/huge-1500-point-swing-dow-221810873.html,1665699490,STORY,"['USB', 'USB-PQ']","[Wow! We thought we had an interesting week of trading before today — we hadn’t seen anything yet. A jaw-dropping swing of more than 1500 points on the Dow today illustrates the topsy-turvy environment we’ve experienced, and without any major catalyst for reversing the downward trajectory.Well, there is one: 52-week lows were hit like a third rail, and markets recoiled the other direction. The S&amp;P 500 briefly touched below 3500 and hurtled north for the rest of the session, with the other major indices along for the ride. By the closing bell, we saw the Dow +827 points, +2.83%, while the S&amp;P was +2.60%. The Nasdaq underperformed the field but still grew +2.23%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 reached +2.41%. Financials and Energy led the way, a day ahead of major banks reporting Q3 earnings tomorrow morning.To be clear, this morning’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report was bad news pretty much all the way around — at least in terms of whether the Fed will see fit to ease up on interest rate hikes. Aside from an 8-handle year over year yet again (+8.2%, up from +8.1% expected), September showed +0.8% price increases in food and medical costs. These numbers are more entrenched in the economy than food and energy prices — which, for September’s “core” read, reached new 40-year highs to +6.6% year over year.So what explains the Dow’s single-best trading day since November 2020? Certainly nothing regarding inflation data. It would also be hard to make an argument that the pivot in the U.K. from a contrarian tax cut while global interest rates grow to something seemingly more rational could have made up this vast difference today; this news out of Britain came out before the CPI numbers were released. And while they do depict the fast action of a world looking to mend where the Fed is “breaking things,” they do not fully explain the sort of major snap-back we saw in the markets today.Until further evidence is submitted, it would appear hitting multi-year lows is a bridge too far at this time for market participants. The calculus may be that pricing-in another 75 basis-point rate hike at the top of next month doesn’t require such a deep sell-off — indeed, it may appear as if much of this move is already priced in. While we were all disappointed not see a big inflation iceberg drop into the sea with CPI data this morning, such as a 7-handle year over year which would have shown a 200 bps drop since June, we seem to be standing on terra firma, relatively speaking.Tomorrow morning, we get Q3 earnings report from an outsized market capitalization of Wall Street banks: JPMorgan Chase JPM, Citigroup C, Wells Fargo WFC, Morgan Stanley MS and U.S. Bancorp USB, among others. JPMorgan, which is expected to report -20% earnings growth on +9% revenues year over year, rose +5.5% today. This is along the lines of what can be expected from the others, although Wells and U.S. Bank are expected to report lower quarterly revenues, as well.Questions or comments about this article and/or its author?

CF to produce blue ammonia, which is expected to help decarbonize hard-to-abate industrial facilities.Illinois-based CF Industries is a leading producer of nitrogen fertilizer in North America. One of the company’s principal nitrogenous fertilizer products is ammonia. With the latest agreement, CF wants to produce ammonia from low-carbon blue hydrogen, which is hydrogen produced from natural gas through carbon capture and storage (CCS).CF Industries is investing $200 million to manufacture a carbon dioxide (CO2) dehydration and compression unit at its Louisiana complex to process emissions from its ammonia production. CF intends to market up to 1.7 million tons of blue ammonia per year through CCS operations.Per the terms of the deal, ExxonMobil will transport CO2 from CF Industries’ Donaldsonville ammonia production facility to a geologic storage site in Louisiana. XOM will transport and store underground 2 million metric tons of CO2 per year. The project will likely be up and running in early 2025.Oil and gas companies are getting actively involved in CCS projects, as it offers a transition pathway for the rapid and effective reduction of CO2 emissions beyond what can be achieved by alternative methods like electrification and renewable fuels. Thus, the use of CCS in reducing industrial emissions offers an excellent opportunity.ExxonMobil will develop a 125,000-acre storage site in Vermilion Parish for the CCS project. The companies could prevent significant volumes of CO2 from releasing into the atmosphere per year. This will be equivalent to replacing 700,000 gasoline-powered cars to electric vehicles.The agreement is part of ExxonMobil’s plan to invest $15 billion in low-carbon projects by 2027. About $9 billion will be spent for emission reduction at the company’s sites, while the remainder will be used for carbon capture, hydrogen and biofuels.Story continuesCompany Profile &amp; Price PerformanceHeadquartered in Irving, TX, ExxonMobil is one of the leading integrated energy companies in the world.Shares of ExxonMobil have outperformed the industry in the past six months.

If you want to read about some more inflation stocks, go directly to 5 Best Inflation Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Inflationary pressures in the past few months have forced the Federal Reserve in the United States to raise rates five times this year. The total increase comes to about 3 percentage points, a figure expected to rise by 0.75 percentage points when the central bank meets again in three weeks. Inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics continues to paint a bleak picture for the economy. Per latest numbers, the producer price index, a measure of prices that US businesses get for the goods and services they produce, increased 0.4% in September. The increase excluded food, energy, and trade services and represented a 5.6% rise from a year ago. Food prices led to an increase in goods inflation, with a 1.2% monthly hike. Energy rose 0.7% after posting massive gains the previous two months. US President Joe Biden has played down risks of a recession in the US in the wake of these figures, telling CNN recently that he did not think the US would sink into a recession, but even if it did, he expected it to be a very slight one, remarking that finance experts predicted a recession every six months. Investors who are anticipating a recession in the US economy have loaded up on some of the best inflation stocks like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and The Proctor and Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as the benchmark indexes continue to register declines. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, recently told reporters that “the worst is yet to come, and for many people, 2023 will feel like a recession”. Our MethodologyThese companies that have shown historical resilience against an inflationary environment were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe. Story continues10 Best Inflation Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Kaleidico on UnsplashBest Inflation Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds10.

The company received an all-cash takeover offer from rival Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), which we also held in the portfolio, for SEK 106 per share—a 35% premium to Swedish Match’s prior closing share price. The deal is a good fit for PM as it reduces PM’s dependence on cigarettes—a category in steady decline—and accelerates the company’s transition to smokeless “reduced-risk” products (RRPs)—a category that has experienced rapid growth over the past five years. PM can also leverage its global scale to generate significant revenue synergies from these complementary product sets, as well as quickly gain access to the US market—the world’s largest market for RRPs and one where regulators have embraced RRPs and other less harmful nicotine products. We exited our position in Swedish Match as shares approached the takeout price.”7.

23,2ab900df-461f-354f-8572-ff990a43941d,MMC,2022-10-14,Marsh & McLennan (MMC) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marsh-mclennan-mmc-earnings-expected-140002748.html,1665669602,STORY,['MMC'],"[Marsh &amp; McLennan (MMC) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 20, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis global professional services firm providing strategy, risk and people solutions is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.16 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.4%.Revenues are expected to be $4.85 billion, up 5.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.58% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Marsh &amp; McLennan?For Marsh &amp; McLennan, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.25%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Marsh &amp; McLennan will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Marsh &amp; McLennan would post earnings of $1.86 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.89, delivering a surprise of +1.61%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Marsh &amp; McLennan appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

24,80bd5275-2459-30e9-8046-c8bb291ca1e4,HBAN,2022-10-14,Strength Seen in Huntington Bancshares (HBAN): Can Its 6.6% Jump Turn into More Strength?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/strength-seen-huntington-bancshares-hban-102310046.html,1665742990,STORY,"['HBAN', 'PRK']","[Huntington Bancshares (HBAN) shares rallied 6.6% in the last trading session to close at $13.89. This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 6.1% loss over the past four weeks.Yesterday, the U.S. consumer inflation for September was reported to be higher than expected, up 8.2% on a year-over-year basis. This has likely increased investors’ confidence in a 75-basis-point rate hike when the Fed next meets on Nov 1, with 97.8% of market participants believing in a chance of that move. Amid the higher-rate environment, asset-sensitive banks like Huntington are set to benefit, with a rise in the yield on loans and securities. This has led to bullish investor sentiments, which drove the Huntington stock.This regional bank holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.38 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8.6%. Revenues are expected to be $1.84 billion, up 8.2% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Huntington Bancshares, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. And a stock's price usually doesn't keep moving higher in the absence of any trend in earnings estimate revisions. So, make sure to keep an eye on HBAN going forward to see if this recent jump can turn into more strength down the road.The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

25,352fd361-cd11-3c36-bc54-db0c3923ca2d,MGM,2022-10-14,4 Toxic Stocks That May Stress You Out Amid Market Turmoil,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-toxic-stocks-may-stress-124812061.html,1665665292,STORY,"['LVS', 'MGM']","[Wall Street has witnessed severe volatility so far this year, thanks to the Russia-Ukraine war, Fed’s ultra-hawkish stance and inflationary concerns. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq recorded the sixth consecutive day of declines yesterday. The FOMC Minutes from September's meeting were released yesterday.It was noted that inflation was declining slower than expected and the pressure is expected to persist in the near term. The minutes also suggested that the Fed is likely to keep to its pace of 75 basis points at the next meeting in November. Investors are getting increasingly worried as aggressive rate hikes could push the economy into a recession.Amid such turbulent times, it is just as important to get rid of fundamentally weak toxic stocks as it is to invest in fundamentally strong companies. Toxic companies are usually characterized by huge debt loads and are vulnerable to external shocks. If you want to protect your portfolio’s health, make sure to identify such toxic stocks and dump them right away. MGM Resorts International MGM, Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. TNDM, AngioDynamics Inc. ANGO and Las Vegas Sands LVS are a few such toxic stocks.Investing in a stock whose current price is not rationally justified by its true potential is sure to result in loss over time. Identifying such bloated stocks accurately and discarding them at the right time can protect your portfolio. Overpricing of these toxic stocks can be attributed to either an irrational exuberance associated with them or some serious drawbacks. And if you own such stocks for an inordinate period of time, you are likely to see a significant erosion of your wealth. Selling such toxic stocks can provide some protection to your portfolio health as the market mayhem is likely to continue.Screening CriteriaHere is a winning strategy that will help you to identify overpriced toxic stocks:Most recent Debt/Equity Ratio greater than the median industry average: High debt/equity ratio implies high leverage. High leverage indicates a huge level of repayment that the company has to make in connection with the debt amount.Story continuesP/E using 12-month forward EPS estimate greater than 50: A very high forward P/E implies that a stock is highly overvalued.% Change in F (1) and F (2) Estimate (12 Weeks) less than -5: Negative EPS estimate revision for this fiscal year and the next during the past 12 weeks points to analysts’ pessimism.Zacks Rank more than #3 (Hold): We have not considered Buy/Hold-rated stocks that generally outperform or are in line with the market. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Say No to These StocksHere are four of the 22 toxic stocks that showed up on the screen:MGM Resorts:  Based in Las Vegas, NV, MGM Resorts is a holding company and primarily owns and operates casino resorts through wholly-owned subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the easing of certain COVID-19 protective measures, subdued foot traffic is hurting the company’s performance. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MGM’s 2022 bottom line is pegged at a loss of 3 cents a share, having deteriorated from earnings of 4 cents a share over the last seven days. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Tandem Diabetes: Headquartered in California, TNDM designs, develops and markets products for people with insulin-dependent diabetes. The company’s business is being hurt by heavy dependence on the sales of insulin pumps and escalating operating expenses. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TNDM’s 2022 bottom line implies a year-over-year plunge of 196%. The consensus mark for 2022 loss per share has widened 2 cents over the past 60 days. Tandem Diabetes currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 and has a VGM Score of F.AngioDynamics: Headquartered in Latham, ANGO designs, manufactures and sells a wide range of medical, surgical and diagnostic devices. AngioDynamics’ operation in a strict regulatory setting and stiff competitive space are worrying. Pricing pressure and forex woes prevail. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for AngioDynamic’s current fiscal year earnings estimates have moved south by 2 cents a share over the past seven days. The stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has a VGM Score of C.Las Vegas Sands: Based in Las Vegas, LVS is an international developer of multi-use integrated resorts, primarily operating in the United States and Asia. Although casinos in Macao are now open, visitation is still very low in comparison to the pre-pandemic level. This along with high debt levels remains a concern to tide over the ongoing crisis. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LVS’ 2022 loss is pegged at $1.10 a share, having widened from 89 cents over the past 90 days.

On that day, Norwegian Cruise Line is projected to report earnings of -$0.67 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 69.12%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.58 billion, up 932.32% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of -$4.23 per share and revenue of $4.82 billion. These totals would mark changes of +47.58% and +643.38%, respectively, from last year.Investors might also notice recent changes to analyst estimates for Norwegian Cruise Line. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum.

This company, which is in the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This insurer has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 28.32%.For the most recent quarter, MetLife was expected to post earnings of $1.55 per share, but it reported $2 per share instead, representing a surprise of 29.03%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.63 per share, while it actually produced $2.08 per share, a surprise of 27.61%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for MetLife. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.MetLife currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.33%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 2, 2022.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Gartner (IT) earns a Zacks Rank #1 19 days from its next quarterly earnings release on November 1, 2022, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.90 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.90 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.86 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Gartner has an Earnings ESP of 2.15%.IT is just one of a large group of Business Services stocks with a positive ESP figure. Spotify (SPOT) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on October 25, 2022, Spotify holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is -$0.68 a share 12 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Spotify is -$0.83, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 18.2%.IT and SPOT's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Story continuesFind Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The move is to support crude prices, which have been hit by worries that global recession will harm demand.White House officials are worried the cut to production quotas could end up undermining the G7 effort to cap the price of Russian oil. The Biden administration has been trying to persuade countries to help it keep a lid on oil prices, which would hit Moscow's revenues and keep US gas prices in check.It has accused OPEC of ""aligning with Russia"", and President Joe Biden and other lawmakers have vowed there will be ""consequences"" for Saudi Arabia.Story continuesKirby said Saudi Arabia knew the reductions would increase Russian revenues and curb the effectiveness of Western sanctions on Moscow after it invaded Ukraine.His comments came after the Saudi foreign ministry posted a defense of the OPEC output cuts earlier Thursday. It said the move, meant to tackle volatility in the oil market, took the balance of supply and demand into account and was a consensus decision.Kirby pushed back against against that position.""The Saudi foreign ministry can try to spin or deflect, but the facts are simple,"" he said.""As the President has said, we are reevaluating our relationship with Saudi Arabia in light of these actions, and will continue to look for signs about where they stand in combatting Russian aggression.""The Biden administration has been trying to curb gas prices at the pump for American drivers in the lead-up to the November midterm elections.At last check Friday, Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up 0.17% to trade at $94.70 a barrel.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

33,4780e9fa-0437-3c88-9e76-ab5a31cec0fc,O,2022-10-14,Bull of the Day: Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bull-day-marathon-petroleum-corp-100010326.html,1665741610,STORY,"['CL=F', 'NG=F', 'MPC']","[Marathon Petroleum MPC, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has been a substantial beneficiary of the energy surge this year. The stock has gone on to rally to new all-time highs while the general market continues to hover in bear territory. With inflation stubbornly lingering as we’ve seen over the past few months, MPC is set to continue its dominant trend. MPC sports the highest-possible ‘A’ rating in each of our Zacks Value, Growth, and Momentum Style Score categories, indicating an increased likelihood that the stock continues to propel higher. The powerful combination of relative undervaluation and positive earnings estimate revisions should serve bullish MPC investors well into the future.Marathon Petroleum is a component of the Zacks Oil &amp; Gas – Refining and Marketing industry, which currently ranks in the top 1% out of approximately 250 industry groups. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. Also note the favorable characteristics for this group below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuantitative research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s future price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. By targeting stocks contained within leading industry groups, we can dramatically improve our odds of success.Company DescriptionMarathon Petroleum, headquartered in Findlay, Ohio, is engaged in refining, transporting and marketing of petroleum products. MPC also manufactures aromatics, propane, propylene, and sulfur. The company sells refined products to wholesale marketing customers in the United States and internationally.MPC stores and distributes crude oil through pipelines, terminals, and barges. Furthermore, it gathers and transports natural gas liquids. Operating in 37 states, the District of Columbia, and Mexico, the energy giant was founded in 1887.Recent Earnings and Future Estimates MPC has been on a hot streak in terms of earnings surprises, beating estimates in each of the past four quarters – with an average beat of 56.68%. Back in August, the company reported Q2 EPS of $10.61/share, a +15.7% surprise over the $9.17 consensus estimate. When a company is consistently exceeding estimates by this wide of a margin, it typically creates a ‘tailwind’ and boosts price momentum.Story continuesRevenues for the second quarter of $54.2 billion also topped estimates by 63.08%. MPC has surpassed revenue estimates in each of the last four quarters.In the past 60 days, analysts have raised their Q3 EPS projections by +9.02%. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $6.89 per share, reflecting astounding growth of 843.84% relative to the same quarter last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCharting the CourseMPC is up nearly 75% this year alone, widely outperforming the major indices. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to weather bear markets and corrections so gracefully. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. And as we know, MPC has seen a recent batch of positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and MPC continues to post earnings beats), the stock should continue its bullish run into next year.Other Factors to ConsiderMarathon Petroleum remains focused on enhancing shareholder value. The company currently pays a $2.23 (2.2%) dividend.In addition, MPC repurchased $4.1 billion worth of shares during Q2 and has now completed more than 80% of its target to buy back $15 billion in common stock.Bottom LineAs an established veteran in the industry, MPC trends remain favorable amid strength in the energy sector. Buoyed by an undervalued and leading industry group along with a maximum overall Zacks VGM score of ‘A’, it’s not difficult to see why MPC is a compelling investment.A history of large earnings surprises along with a strong technical trend certainly warrant a closer look at this top-rated stock. Recent positive earnings estimate revisions should also serve to create a ‘floor’ in terms of any sudden or unexpected downside moves. If you’re looking for a way to diversify your portfolio, make sure to put MPC on your shortlist.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The next U.S. interest rate decision is due on Nov. 1-2.U.S. consumer sentiment continued to improve steadily in October, but households' inflation expectations deteriorated a bit, a survey showed.The improvement in consumer sentiment ""is being viewed as a negative because it means the Fed needs to break the spirit of the consumers and slow the economy down more, and that's caused an increase in the dollar and downward pressure on the oil market,"" said Phil Flynn, analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.The U.S. dollar index rose around 0.8%. A stronger dollar reduces demand for oil by making the fuel more expensive for buyers using other currencies.In U.S. supply, energy firms this week added eight oil rigs to bring the total to 610, their highest since March 2020, energy services firm Baker Hughes Co said.China, the world's largest crude oil importer, has been fighting COVID-19 flare-ups after a week-long holiday. The country's infection tally is small by global standards, but it adheres to a zero-COVID policy that is weighing heavily on economic activity and thus oil demand.The International Energy Agency (IEA) on Thursday cut its oil demand forecast for this and next year, warning of a potential global recession.Story continuesThe market is still digesting a decision last week from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, together known as OPEC+, when they announced a 2 million barrel per day (bpd) cut to oil production targets.Underproduction among the group means this will probably translate to a 1 million bpd cut, the IEA estimates.Saudi Arabia and the United States have clashed over the decision.Meanwhile, money managers raised their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions by 20,215 contracts to 194,780 in the week to Oct. 11, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said.(Reporting by Stephanie Kelly in New York; additional reporting by Shadia Nasralla in London, Emily Chow in SingaporeEditing by David Evans, Will Dunham and Marguerita Choy)]"

""My guess is that we will see that clarity and it will be more evident certainly by the middle of next year,"" he said, adding benchmark rates are likely to go to 4.5%.Gorman indicated the bank is taking some measures to navigate the challenging environment. ""We've been quite cautious in our leverage finance arena,"" he told analysts.Some cost-cutting actions are also on the radar. ""We're looking at headcount. You've got to take into account the rate of growth we've had in the last few years, and we've learned some things through COVID about how we can operate more efficiently,"" he said without providing details.The bank's investment banking revenue more than halved to $1.3 billion, with declines across the bank's advisory, equity and fixed income segments.Global M&amp;A lost ground for the third straight quarter with volumes in the United States plummeting nearly 63% as the rising cost of debt forced companies to delay big buyouts.Companies have also been delaying plans to go public amid depressed investor sentiment due to turmoil in financial markets triggered by the Ukraine war and rapidly rising borrowing costs.For a dealmaking rebound, Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya told Reuters both cost of capital and valuations need to stabilize.Morgan Stanley's net revenue in the last quarter fell 12% to $13 billion. The bank reported a profit of $2.49 billion, or $1.47 per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with $3.58 billion, or $1.98 per share, a year earlier.Story continuesAnalysts on average had expected a profit of $1.49 per share and revenues of $13.3 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. It was not immediately clear if the reported numbers were comparable with the estimates.In a note to clients, UBS analysts said the results were solid, but ""noisy"" as provisions and the tax rate came lower than expected, offsetting negative performance fees.Morgan Stanley joins rivals JPMorgan Chase and Co and Well Fargo &amp; Co which reported similar hits to their quarterly profits on Friday amid uncertain economic conditions that have led banks to build rainy day funds.Morgan Stanley's wealth management business, which tends to generate steady income, was a surprise bright spot, posting a 3% rise in revenue, helped by a 49% jump in net interest income amid rising Federal fund rates.Its return on tangible equity was at 14.6%, down 5 percentage points from a year earlier. This fell well short of the bank's long-term goal of 20%, a JPMorgan analyst said.(Reporting by Manya Saini in Bangalore, and Carolina Mandl in New York, additional reporting by Saeed Azhar, in New York; Editing by Arun Koyyur, Nick Zieminski and Josie Kao)]"

From time to time, Morgan Stanley may disclose certain ""non-GAAP financial measures"" in the course of its earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and otherwise. The Securities and Exchange Commission defines a ""non-GAAP financial measure"" as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude, or include amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by Morgan Stanley are provided as additional information to analysts, investors and other stakeholders in order to provide them with greater transparency about, or an alternative method for assessing our financial condition, operating results, or capital adequacy. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for U.S. GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference and such comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.3 Our earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and other communications may also include certain metrics which we believe to be useful to us, analysts, investors, and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an additional means of assessing, our financial condition and operating results.4 Return on average tangible common equity and return on average tangible common equity excluding integration-related expenses are non-GAAP financial measures that the Firm considers useful for analysts, investors and other stakeholders to allow comparability of period-to-period operating performance and capital adequacy. The calculation of return on average tangible common equity represents full year or annualized net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average tangible common equity. Tangible common equity, also a non-GAAP financial measure, represents common equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction. The calculation of return on average tangible common equity excluding integration-related expenses is adjusted in both the numerator and the denominator to exclude the integration-related expenses associated with the acquisitions of E*TRADE and Eaton Vance.5 The Firm’s and business segment’s third quarter results for 2022 and 2021 include integration-related expenses as a result of the E*TRADE and Eaton Vance acquisitions reported in the Wealth Management segment and Investment Management segment, respectively.

The Firm expense efficiency ratio excluding integration-related expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Firm considers useful for analysts, investors and other stakeholders to allow comparability of period-to-period operating performance.7 Pre-tax margin represents income before taxes divided by net revenues. Wealth Management pre-tax margin excluding the integration-related expenses represents income before taxes less those expenses divided by net revenues. Wealth Management pre-tax margin excluding integration-related expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Firm considers useful for analysts, investors and other stakeholders to allow comparability of period-to-period operating performance.8 Pre-tax income represents income before provision for income taxes.9 Wealth Management fee-based client assets represent the amount of assets in client accounts where the basis of payment for services is a fee calculated on those assets.10 Wealth Management fee-based asset flows include net new fee-based assets (including asset acquisitions), net account transfers, dividends, interest, and client fees, and exclude institutional cash management related activity.11 AUM is defined as assets under management or supervision.12 Long-term net flows include the Equity, Fixed Income and Alternative and Solutions asset classes and excludes the Liquidity and Overlay Services asset class.13 Transactional revenues include investment banking, trading, and commissions and fee revenues. Transactional revenues excluding the impact of mark-to-market gains/losses on investments associated with certain employee deferred compensation plans is a non-GAAP financial measure that the Firm considers useful for analysts, investors and other stakeholders to allow better comparability of period-to-period operating performance and capital adequacy.14 Capital ratios are estimates as of the press release date, October 14, 2022.15 CET1 capital is defined as Common Equity Tier 1 capital. The Firm’s risk-based capital ratios are computed under each of the (i) standardized approaches for calculating credit risk and market risk risk‐weighted assets (RWAs) (the ""Standardized Approach"") and (ii) applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit risk, market risk and operational risk RWAs (the ""Advanced Approach"").

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Morgan Stanley MS, UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL and First Horizon Corp. FHN.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Large-Cap Stocks Likely to Beat on Q3 EarningsU.S. stock markets are set for the third-quarter 2022 earnings season commencing this week.  Market participants will keenly watch this earnings season as it will provide the most descriptive view of U.S. corporate health amid record-high inflation and an extremely hawkish Fed.In addition to revenues and the net profit numbers of companies, several metrics of margins, like gross margin, operating margin and net margin will be of immense importance to investors this earnings cycle. Moreover, the outlook of U.S. corporations will guide the next course of Wall Street’s movement.Our estimates for third-quarter earnings of the market’s benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 Index, have shown a gradual decline in the past three and a half months. As of Oct 12, per our estimation for the third quarter as a whole, total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index will rise a mere 0.1% year over year on 9.1% higher revenues.We have identified five large-cap stocks that are set to beat on third-quarter earnings. Investment in these stocks should be fruitful as an earnings beat is expected to drive stock prices going forward. These companies are — Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group Inc., Lockheed Martin Corp., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and First Horizon Corp.Q3 at a GlanceLike the first half, the third quarter of 2022 also remained tough for the U.S. economy. Various measures of inflation remained elevated at a 40-year high. The Fed has hiked the benchmark interest rate by 3% so far in 2022 and it was in the range of 3.25% to 3.5% at the end of the third quarter. Moreover, the central bank has started to reduce the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet systematically since June.Story continuesDespite these aggressive monetary policies adopted by the Fed, inflation is showing no signs of declining. The complete devastation of the global supply-chain system and the shortage of labor continued to put pressure on businesses in the form of higher input costs and wages.The lingering war between Russia and Ukraine and the lockdown in China due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections were the major hindrances to the restoration of the global supply-chain system. Agencies like the IMF, the World Bank and the OECD have warned of a possible global recession in 2023.Stocks in FocusFive large-cap companies will report third-quarter 2022 earnings within the next seven days.

Thompson. The chat was hosted by Black Enterprise Editor-in-Chief Derek Dingle.Robinson, who serves on numerous corporate boards, including American Airlines, the Georgia Aquarium and Progressive Finance, started the panel by discussing why corporate boards are important and why Black Men and women should be represented on them.“I think it’s obvious to me why it’s important that we seek out opportunities to be on corporate boards Because we basically are the ones that keep America in business,” Robinson told the panel. “We’re active consumers and the way you ensure that you get a piece of the pie is and that your community is being served well is you have to have a voice in the boardroom where decisions are being made and so I firmly believe that the idea of being on a corporate board gives you a voice at the table and a voice that really matters.“Why do I think it’s important for African-Americans to be there, because we represent a very large part of the consumer base for just about every company in the world.”According to Harvard, there were 449 new board members appointed in Fortune 500 companies in 2022 Black people accounted for six percent of corporate board seats.Thompson added that when it comes to equity pledges corporations made in 2020 the role the board should play is ensuring the company acts on its pledges.“When pledges and Commitments are made, it goes back to the accountability aspect of it,” Brown, who has been with FedEx for more than four decades, told the panel. ”The board should hold the CEO accountable to execute and deliver on those promises so absolutely, the board has a role in that.”Story continuesThompson also talked about DEI pledges and strategies saying that if companies just hire people, their strategy will fail. Instead, it has to be a coordinated effort, which can’t be done overnight.“DEI is a strategy just like any other strategy, You can’t just go out and say I want to hire two of these and three of these and say okay I have a DEI program, as Ray just stated that’s not sustainable,” Brown added. “A good DEI strategy and organization understand how people come into an organization, who’s being groomed, who’s being developed, who’s being given the responsibilities so people can see them and what they do and that takes time, so it has to be a strategy.”The men also touched on how Black men and women can start their path to corporate boards.”The first boards I joined gave me access to CEOs for major corporations so that was the first step to getting into that club, if you will. Things have changed from 25 years ago, now there are agencies out there that really work for the boards and screen and do a lot of recruiting.” Thompson added on of the most prominent one of the most prominent recruiters is The Ferguson Group out of Chicago which has established an African-American advisory board to find qualified African-Americans for corporate boards. According to Thompson, there are another 10 boards like the Ferguson group that do the same.Thompson added one of the most prominent recruiters is the Ferguson group out of Chicago which has established an African-American advisory board to find qualified African Americans for corporate boards. According to Thompson, there are more boards like this focused on getting more Black people on corporate boards.“I would suggest getting to know people through university associations and nonprofit associations but also going through the agencies and getting your resume in their data bank]"

(NYSE:CRM) stock at an average sell price of US$173 during the past year. The company’s market cap plunged by US$10b after price dropped by 6.4% last week but insiders were able to limit their loss to an extent.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Salesforce Salesforce Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Co-Founder, Marc Benioff, sold US$53m worth of shares at a price of US$182 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$145. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Salesforce insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Salesforce better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of SalesforceFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Salesforce insiders own 3.1% of the company, worth about US$4.6b. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Salesforce Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Salesforce shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Salesforce insiders selling. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. While conducting our analysis, we found that Salesforce has 3 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore them.Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

48,feaeb31c-9ac7-3e6d-aadc-395674837d69,CRM,2022-10-14,Snowflake’s Pay-What-You-Use Pricing Gains Favor With Software Firms,Bloomberg,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/snowflake-pay-pricing-gains-favor-120000027.html,1665662400,STORY,"['SNOW', 'AI']","[(Bloomberg) -- Business software pricing is starting to look less like a monthly Netflix subscription and more like your home water bill.Most Read from BloombergA Tense Pay Dispute Overshadows Nintendo’s Upcoming Bayonetta 3$200 Diesel Puts Biden in an Ugly CornerTrump Special Master Has ‘No Patience’ for Records SpatsBlinken Says China Wants to Seize Taiwan on ‘Much Faster Timeline’Putin’s War Escalation Is Hastening Demographic Crash for RussiaEconomic uncertainty and tightening budgets are accelerating a move to consumption pricing, which charges software customers based on how much they use a product rather than a recurring annual or multiyear subscription fee. The model, popularized by Snowflake Inc., is being adopted by a growing number of software makers, including C3.ai Inc. and Autodesk Inc.Analysts have traditionally viewed pay-as-you-go as a liability for providers, figuring that customers can more quickly dial back spending when times get rough. But in the current market slowdown, consumption-model cheerleader Snowflake said it continues to attract new clients to its data storage and analytics products who want to pay just for what they need when money is tight rather than being locked into a big contract. Subscription-model stalwarts like Salesforce Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. by contrast have reported a slowdown in acquiring new business.The slowing sales cycles helped push C3.ai, an enterprise software provider led by industry veteran Tom Siebel, to switch all new business to consumption pricing. Signing up new customers is much easier now that initial purchase is cheaper and requires less executive approval, Siebel said. “In a recession, you need to talk about pennies not millions.”Siebel, who sold his eponymous customer relationship management company to Oracle Corp. in 2006, said the pricing transition will flatten revenue in the short term before accelerating growth. Last month, Mike Cikos, an analyst at Needham &amp; Co., said it’s a challenge for companies to change the way they sell their products, and C3.ai’s shares are “likely to stay in limbo until we have line of sight to the other side of the transition.”Story continuesCloud-computing providers like Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Alphabet Inc. have long charged customers based on how much server space is used, but this pricing model has expanded to more kinds of software services, according to a 2021 report by venture capital firm OpenView Partners. More than half of software companies said they expect to use consumption pricing by 2023, according to a survey it conducted. Other notable examples include customer communication provider Twilio Inc. and OpenAI’s image generator Dall-E.Software stocks have been battered this year as traders bet on increasingly aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. The iShares expanded software ETF is down 38% this year compared with 214% drop in the broad-based S&amp;P 500. Unprofitability, long accepted in high-growth firms, has been a particular black mark on software companies like Snowflake this year, with a basket of money-losing tech companies compiled by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. down 59%. In this economic backdrop, its unsurprising tech leaders are willing to try new pricing strategies to keep growth going.Not every executive is convinced. Atlassian Corp. Co-CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes said the pricing model makes less sense for collaborative applications, particularly when there’s not a specific resource like server space being consumed. Customers expect a simple per-user subscription cost for workplace tools that are a part of the typical business day like Atlassian’s Trello, Cannon-Brookes said. “I don’t feel demand to move away from it.”Consumption pricing doesn’t work as well when users are discouraged from using the service by continually climbing costs -- also known as the “taxi-meter effect” -- according to the OpenView report. They pointed toward Adecco Group AG’s platform Hired.com, where recruiters posted fewer job listings when pricing was pay-per-hire. Customers may also be put off by high cost variability and prefer a more simplified buying experience, according to the OpenView researchers.Snowflake bills sometimes also have surprised customers. Numerous social media posts share stories of high charges from the company or trade tips on keeping costs down. Earlier this year, Snowflake executives said improvements to its products would lower customer expenses.Usage-based pricing is less common in applications than infrastructure, but that may be changing. Autodesk, known for its architectural and manufacturing design programs, last year introduced one-day “Flex” licenses. Under this plan, AutoCAD -- one of its flagship applications -- costs $21 for each day of use compared with a standard $235-a-month subscription plan. Chief Executive Officer Andrew Anagnost said about 40% of the users of the flex pricing model are new.“It’s a powerful tool for small businesses that can’t afford a full subscription to everything we do,” Anagnost said. “I think eventually, most everyone’s going to end up in some kind of consumption plan.”Snowflake Chief Revenue Officer Chris Degnan started as the company’s first salesperson in 2013, and remembers it was “not easy” to sell the consumption-based product to companies that had never heard of it. Snowflake even had to build its own billing system, since most payment processors were geared toward handling subscriptions.Today, Snowflake looks like the elder statesman of pay-for-what-you-use pricing. Degnan said he gets many executives calling him to ask about switching their companies to Snowflake’s model.“There are going to be software-as-a-service companies that don’t make that transition that will fail,” Degnan said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMark Zuckerberg Isn’t Saying Much About Facebook These DaysUkrainians Return Home by the Millions Even as War Rages OnHow Gamers Beat NFTsA Digital Drive to Reform the $11 Trillion Global Gold MarketJohn Mack, Who Led Morgan Stanley Into a Crisis, Regrets Little©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Investors can't control the latter, but they can focus on a company's earnings results every quarter.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The last thing we will do today, now that we have a grasp on the ESP and how powerful of a tool it can be, is to look at a qualifying stock. Live Nation (LYV) holds a Zacks Rank #1 at the moment and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.17 a share 21 days away from its upcoming earnings release on November 3, 2022.LYV has an Earnings ESP figure of 6.69%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.17 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.09.LYV is part of a big group of Consumer Discretionary stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Ralph Lauren (RL) as well.Ralph Lauren is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on November 1, 2022. RL's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $2.08 a share 19 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Ralph Lauren is $2.07, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.08%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, LYV and RL could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

As of October 10, the S&amp;P 500 has lost 24.5% since the beginning of 2022, the Nasdaq composite is down 33.3% for the year, and the Dow has tanked by over 19% year to date. The Fed has signaled that it will remain hawkish until inflation is tamed, even if it throws the economy in a recession. Analysts at major banks are slashing their market forecasts in anticipation of a recession. On October 3, Reuters reported that both Credit Suisse and Citigroup slashed their forecasts for the S&amp;P 500. Credit Suisse analysts see the S&amp;P 500 falling to 3,850 points by the end of 2022, down 10% from its prior target. Citigroup cut its target for the S&amp;P 500 by 4% and said that it sees the S&amp;P 500 reaching 4,000 points by year-end. On October 10, billionaire entrepreneur and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, James Dimon, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he revealed that he sees the S&amp;P 500 losing an additional 20% from current levels by year-end, which implies the S&amp;P 500 falling to below 3000 points. Jamie Dimon said that unexpectedly high interest rates, quantitative tightening, and the Ukraine war can push the U.S. economy into a recession in 2023. Here are some comments from Jamie Dimon about where he sees the S&amp;P 500 hitting a trough:""It really depends on that 'soft landing' (mild recession) or 'hard landing' (severe recession) thing. Since I don't know the answer to that, it's hard for me to answer that. But it could be another easy 20%. And I think the next 20% will be much more painful than the first, rates going up another 100 basis points will be a lot more painful than the first 100, because people aren't used to it...""The stock market is in turmoil and is highly volatile.

A blue-chip tech champion with a market capitalization of over $500 billion in early 2000, the stock was trading at a P/E multiple of 42. It was a fast-growing company whose stock price and multiple declined more or less in line with its peers. However, unlike Google, Intel’s net income has grown from $7.3 billion in 1999 to $19.9 billion in 2021, a compounded annual growth rate of just 4.7%. Its growth from the dot com era has not proven to be durable, and Intel has yet to trade at the price it attained in 1999.”12. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)Volume as of October 10: 41.75 MillionAverage Volume (3-Month): 57.1 MillionNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 252Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) proved resilient in the face of ongoing macro pressures and delivered a strong quarterly result along with “better-than-feared” guidance for the third quarter. Net sales increased 7% year-on-year (10% constant currency) to $121.2 billion, while operating profit declined 57% to $3.3 billion. The drop in operating profit was attributable not only to external macro factors, such as elevated shipping and fuel costs, but also lower productivity and efficiency costs as a result of some overcapacity on the back of its recent investment cycle. It was pleasing to see that the company has begun to make progress on the more controllable costs, particularly productivity and staffing, with headcount, for example, down almost 100,000 over the quarter. We continue to believe Amazon is well positioned to manage these short-term issues and remains on track to deliver significant profit improvements over the next twelve months.Management also confirmed that they have not seen any deterioration in Prime membership growth or retention following the 17% increase in Prime fees put through earlier in the year. This is not surprising to us, as in our view, the price increase was more than justified given the tremendous amount of customer value that has been added since the last price increase was implemented back in 2018, which includes the doubling of its fulfilment network and workforce, significant expansion of free same-day delivery and considerable investments in video and music content. Ultimately, we remain positive about Amazon’s future and believe that the company’s scale and market leadership will continue to drive growth for many years to come.”11. AT&amp;T Inc.

In short, a move in the direction desired by the SEC, although still far from the optimal result, that is, unrestricted access to information.

Vale’s stock price is about where it was at the beginning of last year. Despite the market’s lack of enthusiasm, the company generated about $20 billion of free cash flow last year. Not bad for a company with a market cap of a little over $100 billion and no substantive debt as of the end of March. 4 What did the company do with all that cash? Last year, Vale paid out about $9 billion in regularly scheduled dividends and distributed another $10 billion between extra dividends and share repurchases. Combined with dividends distributed in the first quarter of this year and a recently announced share repurchase, Vale has returned or announced the return of over $33 billion since the beginning of last year, almost a 32% yield relative to the market cap of the company.

Revealed at the Meta Connect developer conference on Tuesday, the $1,500 Meta Quest Pro is clearly an investment for prosumers or companies that are serious about the virtual experience.Having already leaked prior to the event, the slimmer, curvier device won’t surprise VR fans but those with the deep pockets to afford it will welcome the redesigned controllers, more balanced weight distribution and dock for easier charging. What matters more, however, lies within, as new depth sensors, cameras and a major processor upgrade pave the way for more capabilities for power users, developers and businesses. Or so Meta hopes.More from WWDScenes from Decentraland's Metaverse Fashion Week2020 Holiday Gift Ideas: Google's Top Searched Beauty, Home and Tech GiftsInside the Jacquard by Google Exhibit in ParisIn other words, this premium gizmo wasn’t built to inspire blockbuster sales, but showcase what chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg’s metaverse can do.The company clearly heard the criticisms over lackluster avatars, experiences and use cases, so it built a gadget capable of running improvements on all of those fronts. But calling the Quest Pro a VR device is something of a misnomer. While it immerses users in 360-degree digital environments, the tech is also plotting a course to mixed reality (XR), a souped up version of augmented reality that not only blends real and virtual elements but allows them to interact.That opens up new experiences for the type of social metaverse of Zuckerberg’s dreams, and how the business world is the key to unlocking it.“Millions of people use it to play games, workout, collaborate or just have fun, but for virtual reality to really reach its full potential, we need to get to the point where the 200 million people who buy new PCs each year for work can do some or all of their work even better in the metaverse,” he said.Story continuesCompanies already use VR and XR in myriad ways, according to Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, chief technology officer and head of Meta’s Reality Labs. He ran through scenarios like molecular drug discovery, large-scale event planning, training and even footwear design.“It’s a whole new kind of creative tool,” he explained. “Puma and New Balance have been designing shoes in VR using Gravity Sketch, one of my favorite 3D design apps on Quest 2.”Andrew Bosworth explains that sneaker brands Puma and New Balance use VR to design shoes.Creatives are a particularly high priority, whether they’re from large companies or small developers, down to indie creators on social media.According to Vishal Shah, Meta’s vice president of the metaverse, the company is testing ways to allow creators to share video from Horizon Worlds — the VR app that houses Meta’s social metaverse — to Instagram Reels. It’s also connecting them to builders in Horizon Worlds “to see what kinds of things they can make together.”What that will amount to remains to be seen, but the experimentation makes sense, given that Meta’s bread and butter is social media. Also unclear is how observers should square Shah’s apparent onscreen enthusiasm with recent revelations. Just days before, a leaked memo penned by Shah blasted Horizon Worlds as buggy, while pressuring seemingly unwilling staffers to use it. Awkward.Corporate drama aside, Meta was eager to showcase its tech advancements, particularly for avatars and especially after Zuckerberg drew flack over a metaverse selfie in August.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.The new full-body digital personas are much more refined. Inward-facing cameras and sensors in the Quest Pro allow for more nuanced facial expressions and thanks to better body tracking and artificial intelligence, the characters are equipped with legs for the first time.Meta is betting that users will love these new digital twins enough to take them beyond VR. So for “continuity,” people can use them in Facebook Messenger and Instagram, with WhatsApp following in the future. In Horizon Worlds, they can also maintain multiple VR personas for, say, a professional look for work and a fantasy character for fun.The real Mark Zuckerberg and his digital twin.Meta’s avatars will be able to strut their stuff, thanks to the addition of legs.This is just the latest push to tie the company’s apps together under the metaverse umbrella.In recent months, the company began allowing users to post NFTs minted on Ethereum, Polygon and Flow on Instagram and Facebook, as connected via digital wallets like Coinbase Wallet, Dapper Wallet, MetaMask, Rainbow and Trust Wallet. It’s not the only Big Tech firm stepping out with crypto. On Tuesday, Google unveiled a deal with Coinbase to accept crypto payments for cloud services, starting early next year.For Meta, the crypto push remains solidly on the consumer front. On that score, the trajectories of its NFT efforts and its work on avatars appear destined to overlap.Obviously NFT avatar wearables are already available on platforms like Decentraland and others. Zuckerberg isn’t rushing into that yet but his company has been testing metaverse commerce for Horizon Worlds creators and launched NFT support for Instagram profiles. Meanwhile, his fashion-forward Avatar Store, which is just a few months old, is already growing up. According to the company, the store will go from 2D screens to VR later this year, potentially allowing Quest users to clothe their 3D characters in designers like Prada, Balenciaga and Thom Browne.Even if consumers won’t jump into Zuck’s metaverse, they’ll surely see its emissaries out and about on social media and, soon, video calls. People will be able to show up as their avatars on Messenger and Zoom video conferences but other apps will likely follow, thanks to the release of the Meta Avatars software development kit. The developer tools, which let third-party apps make use of the VR characters for gaming and social applications, could have implications for social commerce, fashion, styling game apps and more.The update shows significant improvement over the previous visuals. But it’s nothing compared to what Meta has in mind, longer term.Last year, Zuckerberg offered a preview of what his company was working on for next-generation avatars. This time, one attention-getting section showed off Meta’s progress since then, with near photo-realistic visuals featuring multidimensional skin-tone shading and lighting. That’s not all: “What sets these Codec Avatars apart from other high-quality avatars that you might have seen is that they’re fully drivable…not limited to preset movements or expressions,” said the CEO, as his digital doppelgänger mirrored him wrinkling his nose and widening his eyes.Humans (inset) and digital Codec Avatars (foreground).Codec Avatars, like that of CEO Mark Zuckerberg (far right) take a long time to process and render. But the results looks lifelike.He envisions realistic avatars for professional scenarios one day, although not today. Right now, processing and rendering still takes hours, which is why it’s still in the hands of researchers and not product development. But as they work to speed it up, others focus on something else: making it easier to create digital twins via 3D scanning with smartphones. That’s not a new premise — other tech companies and start-ups boast similar approaches — but few yield great results. Here, avatars produced from phone captures aren’t as richly detailed as Codec Avatars involving better equipment but they still looked impressive.There are obviously major privacy and security concerns with realistic digital copies of real people. Zuckerberg noted that the team is weighing encryption and authentication, but in an era when deep-fake videos are already a thing, the matter is worthy of deep scrutiny by cybersecurity experts, if not ethics panels and even regulators. Either way, it’s clear that life-like avatars are on Meta’s roadmap. Should they clear the hurdles, releasing characters that skew more human than cartoon some day, it’s reasonable to expect that equally realistic avatar fashion won’t be far behind.Until then the company has plenty of other things to keep VR fans and developers busy. It unveiled a new Made for Meta program to spur more accessories, a slew of fitness-related software and product updates — including a new active pack of accessories for workouts; an expanded creative toolkit that uses sophisticated 3D design software, and scripting languages to produce better visuals, and more.Meta’s goal is to improve the look and experience of its metaverse.All that work is moot without an audience, of course, and VR goggles aren’t for everyone. So if Meta can’t bring everyone to the metaverse, the plan is to bring it to them across other devices. It’s building Horizon Worlds for the web, opening up access to phones, tablets, laptops and consoles. It’s not the full experience, but more like “metaverse lite,” a taste or first step for the uninitiated.Another access point, at least in principle, is augmented reality glasses. Meta and EssilorLuxottica’s partnership began with last year’s Ray-Ban Stories smart glasses, a precursor to their future AR spectacles. This tech is still evolving, but Rocco Basilico, the eyewear conglomerate’s chief wearables officer, teased that the partners “are working together on a new set of glasses to build a portal to the metaverse.”According to Zuckerberg, this is separate from Project Nazare, the much-publicized AR glasses expected to debut for developers in the next few years. Basilico didn’t elaborate, saying only, “We view our partnership with Meta as a deep, long-term partnership. Together we will bring augmented reality to life with beautiful design.”He did disclose updates for Ray-Ban Stories: The techie eyeglasses, which house embedded microphones and speakers, will get the ability to call or text over a paired smartphone, plus new tap-to-play functionality for Spotify. Such interface changes position the device as more of a personal communication and entertainment gadget, rather than just a face camera.More entertainment is coming to VR as well. A multiyear deal with NBCUniversal will bring shows like “The Office,” “Universal Monsters” and more to the metaverse, and Universal Studios theme parks will offer Meta avatar customization onsite. Also, a VR version of the Peacock app is in the works, and Quest users will be able to watch YouTube VR with friends.Consumer-facing experiences can make or break an emerging platform, but for Zuckerberg, businesses are still the key to unlocking his. There’s precedent for that: Even before the iPhone, Blackberries, often doled out by employers, paved the way for the smartphone’s dominance.The Meta CEO explained his version of rolling out the red carpet for companies: “We built Horizon Workrooms as a first step toward a virtual office in the metaverse,” he said. “It feels more like being there than any video call. You see more people’s body language and the spatial audio gives you a sense of each person’s place in the room. You can have side conversations with the people sitting next to you or gesture without physically being there together.”Collaboration is key, especially for fashion brands, whether that’s in XR — with far-flung designers working on a three-dimensional rendering of a couture dress — hashing out details with merchants or manufacturers on a video call or holding high priority meetings to plan holiday campaigns or fashion week activations.Whether companies would turn to Meta for all that and more is a fair question. It’s one that the tech company itself apparently pondered, because it joined forces with the biggest name in workplace computing: Microsoft.A new integration will connect Horizon Workrooms with Teams, so Quest users can connect to Microsoft’s videoconferencing platform and even use their VR avatars there. “And with Windows 365 coming to Quest, you will have a new way to securely stream the entire Windows experience, including all the personalized apps, content, settings to the VR device with the full power of Windows and Windows applications,” said Satya Nadella, Microsoft CEO. With Azure Active Directory and Microsoft Intune, he added, employers can also secure Quests as they would work phones and computers.The deal might look like all work and no play, but it’s worth remembering that Microsoft also owns Minecraft and runs one of the world’s top gaming platforms. So the arrangement includes access for Quest users to the Xbox Cloud Gaming platform so they can stream games inside VR on gigantic virtual screens, if they’d like.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Microsoft CEO Satya NadellaThough beneficial for Meta, the partnership still has tech pundits scratching their heads. The pair make for strange bedfellows and Nadella has been talking up his own plans for the virtual work world, which is rooted in XR platform Microsoft Mesh. But perhaps it’s not that surprising after all. This summer both companies joined the Metaverse Standards Forum, a group formed to focus on issues like interoperability and collaboration, and the Meta CEO has repeatedly emphasized the need for open, interoperable ecosystems.Translation: The metaverse, according to Zuckerberg, is “where you feel like you’re in it, where you should be able to teleport anywhere with the people you want to engage with and bring all your stuff with you.” That can’t happen if every platform seals itself off in its own walled garden.Now Meta is apparently mining the MSF rolls for partners. It struck a separate arrangement with another member, Accenture, in a deal that could be meaningful for brands and retailers. The global consulting firm is practically a metaverse evangelist and its work with VR and retail traverses training, store layouts, merchandising, distribution and more.According to CEO Julie Sweet, Accenture doesn’t just talk the talk. An employer with more than 700,000 people worldwide, the company has racked up 60,000 Quest 2 headset deployments so far, and its Nth Floor virtual campus — “which we believe is the largest enterprise use of the metaverse,” she noted — serves more than 150,000 people.“After what we’ve learned, we know there’s a huge opportunity for our clients,” Sweet said. “Now we’ll be partnering with Meta and Microsoft to help businesses create new experiences in the metaverse at scale.”Old Facebook and Oculus developer conferences hardly showcased so many updates, partnerships and previews at research projects — like realistic avatars or electromyeography tech capable of reading thumb gestures, which may replace controllers someday.With that, Meta may have looked like it had a lot to prove. But that’s only because it does.Zuckerberg and Boz take a walk.In one way, the jam-packed showcase may amount to much ado about hardly anything. Diehard Quest fans are already balking at the Quest Pro’s prohibitive expense, a price tag that could even give some businesses reason to pause. Others won’t blink at $1,500 — plenty didn’t when Google Glass came out in 2013 for the same amount — but memories of how that other hot face-worn tech flamed out are enough to set off nerves. (Technically, Google Glass is still around for enterprise clients, but the device hasn’t been updated in three years.)For Meta, none of that matters. It doesn’t expect huge sales revenue from the Quest Pro. What it cares about is showing momentum, progress and a lineup of major partners that believe in its vision, thereby proving that its $10 billion a year bet on the metaverse is worth risking the entire $340 billion tech empire. The message to investors, agape at disappointing earnings quarters, as well as brands, developers, enterprises, employers and consumers is unmistakable: “Keep the faith.”Zuckerberg knows that’s a tall order, even admitting publicly this week that VR has hit “the trough of disillusionment.” The tech lingo describes something fashion knows all too well: the fast crash of an “It” fad. So far, Wall Street doesn’t seem convinced that avatars with legs are enough to reverse that.But the CEO still has cards left to play. Somewhere between the last-generation Quest 2 headset and the premium Quest Pro, there’s room for another device — the rumored, and probably more affordable, Quest 3. There’s also EssilorLuxxotica’s new “portal to the metaverse,” whatever that is. If that’s not enough, well, there are still plenty of other potential partners in the Metaverse Standards Forum.Meta should also focus on other, arguably bigger, priorities, such as squashing bugs in Horizon Worlds and figuring out how to draw its “MetaMates” there. Because if the company’s own employees won’t spend time in its metaverse, why would anyone else?]"

But this is no more than a short to medium-term issue, as the long-term outlook for all of Alphabet's businesses, including digital advertizing, remians favorable. Story continuesThe Zacks analysts believes for 2022, Google Cloud revenue to grow 24.7% from 2021. Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results. Moreover, Google’s mobile search is gaining solid momentum. For 2022, we anticipate Google Search revenue to be up 11% from the last year.Also, strong focus on innovation of AI techniques and the home automation space should continue aiding Alphabet’s business growth in the days ahead. Its deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Also, Alphabet’s expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well. Considering the aforesaid factors, we expect 2022 total revenue to grow 10.3% from 2021.(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Eli Lilly shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+37.2% vs. +6.5%). The company’s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Trulicity, Taltz, and others. It is regularly adding promising new pipeline assets through business development deals.Lilly expects to launch five new medicines by 2023 end including Mounjaro for type II diabetes (already launched) and donanemab for early Alzheimer's disease. Both drugs have multibillion dollar sales potential.However, generic competition for several drugs, rising pricing pressure in the United States mainly on key drug, Trulicity, and price cuts in some international markets like China, Japan and Europe are some top-line headwinds. Estimates have gone down slightly ahead of Q3 results.

61,442e8458-5338-4670-8a25-e388865fe159,MSFT,2022-10-14,It’s official: Netflix ad-supported tier will cost $6.99 and launch next month,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/netflix-ad-supported-tier-launch-171131672.html,1665681091,STORY,"['NFLX', 'MSFT', 'DIS']","[Netflix (NFLX) has revealed key details about its upcoming ad-supported tier.The company's ad plan, dubbed ""Basic with Ads,"" will cost $6.99 a month in the U.S. and officially launch on Nov. 3 at 9AM PT — just ahead of Disney's ad-based offering on Dec. 8 (which will be priced at $7.99.)""Basic with Ads"" will complement Netflix's existing ad-free tiers, and be available in 12 countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Spain.The tier will roll out in several stages with Canada and Mexico being the first two countries to access the new offering on Nov. 1. All other eligible countries, excluding Spain, will see a Nov. 3 launch date with Spain rounding out the rollout on Nov. 10. Pricing will vary depending on the country.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.In terms of the $6.99 price tag in the U.S., Netflix said it's ""not heavily anchoring"" its pricing based on competition (Disney+ with ads will cost $7.99), but rather the entertainment value it can deliver to members.The company also shrugged off concerns about consumers trading down to the ad tier, surmising that total revenue will be neutral to positive with the comparable plan.""We're not trying to steer people to one plan or the other,"" Netflix COO Greg Peters said on a call prior to the announcement. ""We think the revenue model will be fine as a result.""'Everything people love about Netflix'Netflix is currently utilizing a fixed price model for advertisers (it would not reveal its cost-per-thousand rate), but said it's open to adjusting that model in the future.According to Netflix Worldwide Advertising President Jeremi Gorman, the platform ""nearly sold out all of its [ad] inventory"" globally for launch.""Basic with Ads"" will feature an average of 4 to 5 minutes of ads per hour with tight frequency caps so members won't see the same ads repeatedly. At launch, ads will run 15 or 30 seconds in length, with some running prior to the start of a program while others will be mid-roll ads.Story continues""In the grand scheme of things, it's a very pro-consumer approach,"" Peters said, emphasizing that the ad experience was ""thoughtfully"" created.""Bridgerton"" season 2 (Courtesy: Netflix)Netflix is currently utilizing a fixed price model for advertisers (it would not reveal its cost-per-thousand rate), but said it's open to adjusting that model in the future.Netflix revealed that a limited number of movies and TV shows won't be available for users in the ad tier due to licensing restrictions, estimating that about 5% to 10% of overall programming won't be available depending on the country. The platform said it will look to reduce that number over time.In addition, users will not be able to download titles due to ""technical complexities.""""In short, Basic with Ads is everything people love about Netflix, at a lower price, with a few ads in-between,"" the company said in a blog post, crediting its partnership with Microsoft (MSFT) for the ad tier's quick 6-month turnover. Microsoft generated $10 billion in advertising sales last year, and was announced as the streamer's technology and sales partner in July.The company said it will offer broad targeting capabilities by country and genre, while advertisers will have the ability to prevent their ads from appearing on content that might be inconsistent with their brand (i.e. sex, nudity, or graphic violence.)Additionally, Netflix plans to lean on Nielsen's Digital Ad Ratings in the U.S. to help advertisers better understand how the platform can reach their target audience. It will become available some time in 2023.The answer to Netflix's problems?Wall Street is fairly optimistic that the ad tier could be the answer to Netflix's myriad of problems.Earlier this week, JPMorgan Analyst Doug Anmuth estimated that Netflix could drive 7.5 million subscribers to its ad tier in the U.S. and Canada in 2023, leading to $600 million in advertising sales.By 2026, Anmuth anticipated that Netflix's U.S. and Canada segment will boast 22 million subscribers and drive $2.65 billion in advertising sales.Yet while Netflix has enjoyed quite a few Wall Street upgrades in recent weeks as a direct result of the upcoming rollout, shares of the streaming giant are still down 63% so far in 2022.Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Food Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

This will eliminate workers’ FOMO (fear of missing out) about important discussions and allow them to skip meetings they don’t need to attend and catch up later.Microsoft recently partnered with Cisco Systems to add its Teams messaging app to the latter’s meeting devices.Another significant collaboration of Microsoft was closed with Meta Platforms META, where Microsoft Teams will integrate with Meta’s Quest devices and provide a way to stream Windows apps to Meta’s Quest Pro VR headsets. This will let Microsoft expand its reach to Meta’s large audience.As part of the collaboration, Microsoft will enter a new productivity-focused virtual reality and augmented reality program with Meta. This will let Microsoft bring some of its most popular remote-working software to the Metaverse, gaining traction from Metaverse users.Microsoft Corporation Price and ConsensusMicrosoft Corporation Price and ConsensusMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation QuoteMicrosoft Teams has been a vital part of the company’s growth ever since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as institutions shifted to a work/study-from-home setup. Teams Phone is the market leader in cloud calling across voice over Internet protocol (VoIP). The public switched telephone network now has over 12 million users, nearly double the number from a year ago.Independent Service Vendors like Adobe and Workday have built deep integrations with Teams. More than 100,000 companies, including Johnson &amp; Johnson, Lumen Technologies and Progressive Insurance, have deployed a custom line of business apps in Teams. The number of third-party and line-of-business apps with active usage increased by 40% year over year.Story continuesMicrosoft Teams Faces Stiff CompetitionDespite the growing demand for Microsoft Teams, the company faces major headwinds from stiff competition.Microsoft, which currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), has lost 32.8% of its share price year to date compared with Alphabet GOOGL and Zoom Video Communications ZM, which declined 32.6% and 59.1%, respectively, in the same time frame.

This exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.4%.Total SalesWalgreens Boots recorded total sales of $32.45 billion for the fiscal fourth quarter, down 5.3% year over year and 3.2% at CER. The top line lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a marginal 0.1%.Total revenues for fiscal 2022 were $132.70 billion, up 0.1% from the year-ago period. This also topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a nominal 0.03%.Quarterly DetailsThe company divided its business into three reportable segments — the United States, International and Walgreens Health — at the start of the fiscal year. During the fiscal Q4 announcement, Walgreens Boots stated that it had changed the names of two reportable segments to better align with its business activities, structure, and strategy.

This was up 34%on a pro forma basisversus the year-ago quarter’s combined result.Within the segment, the Shields business rose 48% on a pro forma basis versus their standalone results in the year-ago quarter. The upside was driven by key contract wins, continued partnership growth and a strong focus on execution.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.57.Our Take Walgreens Boots exited fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 with better-than-expected earnings. However, earnings declined significantly on a year-over-year basis. Lower COVID-19 vaccination volumes in the reported quarter, macroeconomic headwinds and rising expenses impacted the bottom line. Fourth-quarter sales too missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined on a year-over-year basis, majorly impacted by a 660-bp impact from the anticipated sales decline at AllianceRx Walgreens.The company’s International segment reported strong growth, banking on a continued rally in the Boots UK business and growth in the company’s German wholesale business.Walgreens Boots however raised the U.S. Healthcare fiscal 2025 sales target to a band of $11 billion-$12 billion, from $9 billion-$10 billion earlier.

They said they wanted three things: They wanted more variety because in the old program, you could just get a beverage; they wanted more flexibility, and we have now given them a chance to stack points so they can buy a drink for themselves, they can buy a sandwich for their family or a whole meal for the soccer team; and they said they wanted recognition — so for big users we now have boosted status.""That focus group research is fine and good, but the changes did not go over well with the vocal masses on social media.Mascots from Dunkin Donuts pose for photos in front of the NASDAQ market site in Times Square, New York June 6, 2014. REUTERS/Carlo AllegriThe previous DD Perks program served up a free drink of any kind when a user spent $40. Under the new program released last week, customers must spend about $70 to get a free specialty drink such as an espresso or cold brew.Dunkin' says consumers can earn points twice as fast as they did with the outgoing DD Perks program — 10 points instead of five for every $1 spent — and the redemption value has increased.And the free birthday drink — long ago made popular by Dunkin' rival Starbucks — was discontinued.Murphy told Yahoo Finance Live the company — taken over by Arby's, Buffalo Wild Wings, and Sonic owner Inspire Brands for $11.3 billion in 2020 — hears the complaints and is evaluating the changes.That includes the free birthday drink status.""We are thinking about that for sure,"" Murphy said about bringing back the free birthday gift.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

DAL to offer reciprocal earning and redemption benefits to Starbucks Rewards and Delta SkyMiles loyalty program members.Starting Oct 12, 2022, the alliance will facilitate customers to earn and redeem free coffee and miles. Per the agreement, customers need to link their respective accounts to receive miles on purchases made at U.S. Starbucks locations. The initiative allows members to earn one mile per $1 spent at Starbucks and double Stars on days traveling on Delta.Also, Delta SkyMiles announced the addition of Starbucks Stars as a new Choice Benefit. Starting in 2024, the initiative allows Diamond and Platinum SkyMiles Members to select 4,000 Starbucks Stars as one of their annual Choice Benefits. The agreement signals an expansion in benefits for loyalty members of both companies.Ryan Butz, vice president, loyalty strategy and marketing at Starbucks, stated, “Starbucks Rewards and Delta SkyMiles are centered on creating moments of meaningful connection, and by bringing together two of the country’s most celebrated loyalty programs we are able to reward our members with more of what they love. We are excited to partner with Delta to offer our members even more valuable benefits, as well as invite more customers to join Starbucks Rewards.”Increased Focus on Loyalty ProgramThe company made progress regarding personalized digital relationships to expand its reach with members. This includes program enhancements like Stars for Everyone. Starbucks initiated payment partnerships with PayPal and Bakkt, allowing customers to reload their Starbucks cards through a range of cryptocurrencies (including Bitcoin and Ethereum) coupled with the option of converting digital currencies to physical currency. The company is exploring the blockchain platform for ways to connect the Starbucks Rewards program with other merchant rewards programs and the motive of tokenization of stars. The initiative paves a path for the exchange of value across brands, enhanced digital services and the swapping of other loyalty points for stars. Moreover, the company launched account-linking partnership with Air Canada. The company will likely highlight this format as it might serve as the foundation for a new modern payment that aligns expenses with the value received by customers and merchants.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn the past three months, the company’s shares have gained 11.1% compared with the industry’s 0.1% growth.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksStarbucks currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

If you want to read about some more industrial stocks, go directly to 5 Best Industrial Stocks To Buy Now.The United States economy in 2022 has not been as vibrant as 2021. In fact, soaring inflation and rising interest rates have combined to raise recession fears and resulted in a broad selloff at the stock market, pushing down benchmark indexes and turning investors away from even value-oriented sectors such as financials, industrials, materials and energy. However, as travel demand picks up again, inflation cools down, and infrastructure spending ramps up, industrial stocks in particular seem well-positioned to make a strong comeback. Some of the best industrial stocks to buy in this context include TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM). Another catalyst for industrial stocks is the Russian war in Ukraine that has led to increased defense spending around the world. A quick solution to the war seems increasingly unlikely. Thus, aerospace and defense stocks are poised to outperform the broader industry in the coming months. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the industrial sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.13 Best Industrial Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Lenny Kuhne on UnsplashBest Industrial Stocks To Buy Now13. Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34    Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) manufactures and sells industrial products and equipment worldwide. It is one of the best industrial stocks to invest in. On August 24, Bank of America analyst Andrew Obin reinstated coverage of Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) stock with a Neutral rating and a $220 price target, stressing that the rating balances an improving long-term story with near-term macro headwinds.Story continuesAt the end of the second quarter of 2022, 34 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $366 million in Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW), compared to 36 in the previous quarter worth $426 million.Just like TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) is one of the best industrial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. 12. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35 Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) manufactures and sells motion and control technologies and systems for various mobile, industrial, and aerospace markets worldwide. It is one of the top industrial stocks to invest in. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) on September 16 sold its Aircraft Wheel and Brake Division, located in Avon, to Kaman Corporation. Aircraft Wheel &amp; Brake has been a trusted provider of mission-critical wheel and brake technology products and solutions for more than 80 years. On October 03, Barclays analyst Julian Mitchell kept an Overweight rating on Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) stock and lowered the price target to $320 from $340. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Connecticut-based firm Viking Global is a leading shareholder in Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), with 3 million shares worth more than $755.5 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), a U.S. company that specializes in motion and control technologies, is suffering from what we believe are investor misunderstandings and misjudgements, despite the efforts of the company’s unusually strong management team. In our opinion, since his promotion in 2015, CEO Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the product portfolio to longer cycled, higher growth, higher margin and higher return end markets. The results are impressive. Margins, returns and earnings have increased substantially. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition in the September quarter, the highly depressed aerospace segment will be its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which—combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses, including clean technologies and factory automation—should accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be similar or better. At a low-teens multiple of next year’s normalized cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.”11. Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36   Cummins Inc.

78,75722a2e-e694-3fc3-8a4d-61e4f7405cbf,XEL,2022-10-14,Did Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL) Use Debt To Deliver Its ROE Of 10%?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/did-xcel-energy-inc-nasdaq-174454043.html,1665683094,STORY,['XEL'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Xcel Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:XEL).Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Xcel Energy How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Xcel Energy is:10% = US$1.6b ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.10 in profit.Does Xcel Energy Have A Good ROE?Arguably the easiest way to assess company's ROE is to compare it with the average in its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. The image below shows that Xcel Energy has an ROE that is roughly in line with the Electric Utilities industry average (8.9%).roeSo while the ROE is not exceptional, at least its acceptable. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk. You can see the 2 risks we have identified for Xcel Energy by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesXcel Energy's Debt And Its 10% ROEXcel Energy does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.50. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.SummaryReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward.

The company is expected to deliver sales growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.56 per share, indicating a 3.1% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has moved down by a penny in the past seven days. For fiscal first-quarter revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $20.56 billion, suggesting 1.1% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.We expect the company’s fiscal first-quarter total revenues to increase 0.6% year over year to $20,451.5 million and the bottom line to decline 2.6% to $1.57 per share.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 1.6%. It has delivered a bottom-line beat of 1.04%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Procter &amp; Gamble Company The Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Procter &amp; Gamble Company The Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseProcter &amp; Gamble Company The price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Procter &amp; Gamble Company The QuoteKey Factors to NoteProcter &amp; Gamble has been gaining from improved productivity and persistent demand for cleaning products. The company’s first-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to reflect the benefits of continued strength in brands and appropriate strategies, which have been aiding organic sales growth. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for organic sales growth is pegged at 5.6%, which suggests an improvement from 4% growth reported in the prior-year quarter.The company has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans, which have been aiding its margins. PG has been witnessing cost savings and efficiency improvements across all facets of its business, driven by the productivity program. Its continued business investments and efforts to offset macro cost headwinds, and balanced top and bottom-line growth underscore its productivity efforts. Gains from productivity savings and pricing are expected to have aided margins and the bottom line in the fiscal first quarter.Moreover, the company is likely to have witnessed SG&amp;A expense leverage, owing to savings from overhead and marketing expenses, and cost leverage gains due to higher sales and real estate.However, unfavorable mix, commodity cost inflation, increase in freight costs, and product and packaging investments are expected to have marred margins in the to-be-reported quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, Procter &amp; Gamble predicted higher commodity and freight costs to persist throughout fiscal 2023. Our estimate indicates a 0.7% year-over-year decline in gross profit for the fiscal first quarter, with the gross profit margin contracting 60 bps.Also, currency headwinds are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Rising input costs are expected to have weighed on the fiscal first-quarter performance. Our estimate indicates a 3.1% impact from currency headwinds in the fiscal first quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Procter &amp; Gamble this time around.

The company provides wireless, wireline, and Internet communications services for voice and data to businesses and consumers. The company operates as the incumbent local exchange carrier (ILEC) in British Columbia, Alberta and parts of Quebec.TELUS’ performance is benefiting from continued momentum across TELUS technology (TTech) solutions and TELUS International. TTech’s business segment is well-poised to benefit from solid momentum across fixed data, agriculture, customer and health services.In the second quarter of 2022, TTech revenues grew 4% year over year to C$3,701 million, primarily driven by higher mobile network revenues followed by solid performance across fixed data and health services.

Consequently, the demand for Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Inc. HST luxury and upper-upscale hotels in markets with strong demand drivers, like central business districts of main cities, close to airports and in resort/conference destinations, is expected to have revived.Shares of this Bethesda, MD-based lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) have gained 5.8% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 16.6%.Analysts, too, seem bullish on this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HST’s 2022 funds from operations (FFO) per share indicates a favorable outlook for the company as it has increased 2.9% in the past two months to $1.80.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet us decipher the factors behind the increase in the stock price despite the ongoing weakness in the broader markets.Host Hotels has a strong presence in the Sunbelt region, where leisure travel continued to improve, leading to strong rates at resort properties. The company’s all-owned-hotel revenue per available room (RevPAR) during second-quarter 2022 almost doubled to $219.3 million year over year and rose 31.4% sequentially. It was also the first time since the onset of the pandemic that the company’s quarterly RevPAR exceeded the 2019 levels.Moreover, many companies have started implementing a return-to-office policy, resulting in a gradual rise in business transient and group demand. This has further aided the demand for HST’s properties, especially in the Sunbelt region, where offices have begun to reopen.  HST is likely to witness healthy operating performance in the upcoming quarters, given the improvement in the lodging industry fundamentals.The company is likely to report a 40.9% year-over-year growth in revenues for third-quarter 2022. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is presently pegged at $1.2 billion.The company has been undertaking strategic capital allocations to enhance the quality of its portfolio and capitalize on the greater scale and competitive advantage that the markets in the United States offer.Host Hotels’ capital recycling efforts are encouraging. Over the years, HST has been disposing of its non-strategic assets that have maximized their value and utilizing the proceeds for acquiring or investing in premium properties in markets that are anticipated to recover faster, like leisure and drive-to destinations.Additionally, the company has been broadening its acquisition focus to include urban markets beyond the top 25 to enhance its portfolio’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) and revenues. These efforts bode well for its long-term growth.HST maintains a solid balance-sheet position with ample liquidity and no material debt maturities until January 2024. Moreover, it is the only company with an investment-grade rating among the lodging REITs. This financial flexibility has and will continue to aid capital deployment for long-term growth opportunities and facilitate redevelopment activities.The company’s trailing 12-month return on equity (ROE) highlights its growth potential. Its ROE is 8.86% compared with the industry’s average of 3.60%, indicating that it is more efficient in using the shareholders’ funds than its peers.Further, with the holiday season around the corner, we anticipate that the above-mentioned factors will serve as a catalyst for Host Hotels’ performance.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are Life Storage LSI, OUTFRONT Media OUT and Xenia Hotels &amp; Resorts XHR, each carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

PM, Turning Point Brands, Inc. TPB and 22nd Century Group, Inc. XXII.Industry: TobaccoLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/1991376/3-tobacco-stocks-to-watch-even-amid-industry-challengesStringent regulatory norms and limitations have been hurting the cigarette volumes of several players in the Tobacco industry. Also, inflation of raw material, labor and logistic costs has been a concern. That being said, robust pricing power has been an upside.Apart from this, the focus on reduced risk products (RRPs) or smoke-free alternatives has been working well for companies like Philip Morris International Inc., Turning Point Brands, Inc. and 22nd Century Group, Inc.About the IndustryThe Zacks Tobacco industry includes companies that manufacture and sell cigarettes as well as tobacco and nicotine-based products such as cigars, snuffs and oral tobacco. Some of the companies also offer reduced-risk products such as e-cigarettes, vaping and heat-not-burn variants. A few of the firms are also engaged in making devices and attachments needed in vaping and heat-not-burn products.Most of the products manufactured by the tobacco industry participants fall under the strict vigilance of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are required to follow the permissible levels of nicotine in manufacturing. Players in this space sell products mostly through large retailers, distributors, convenience stores, drugstores, wholesalers and grocery chains. Additionally, some of the international tobacco firms operate in the country through subsidiaries.4 Trends Shaping the Future of Tobacco IndustryStern Government Regulations: Cigarette volumes are being affected by strict government regulations pertaining to sales, marketing and manufacturing. Such regulatory norms are imposed due to the health hazards caused by the consumption of nicotine. Some of the guidelines issued by the FDA include the mandatory use of precautionary labels on cigarette packets and self-critical advertisements.Story continuesMoreover, campaigns against tobacco consumption have led to increased consumer awareness, which has, in turn, resulted in lower smoking rates. Since cigarette sales account for the majority of revenues for companies in the tobacco industry, dwindling sales volumes in this category are a concern.On its second-quarter earnings call, Altria stated that the Biden administration introduced plans for future FDA rule-making to come up with a product standard, which would set an upper level for nicotine in cigarettes. The FDA has also proposed rules to ban menthol in cigarettes and characterizing flavors in cigars. Such headwinds, along with the rising health consciousness, have been adversely impacting cigarette sales volumes.Cost Inflation: An overall inflationary cost scenario has been hurting the performance of many industry players. Companies are witnessing elevated inflation rates due to rising global energy, commodity and food prices, due to factors like demand-supply imbalances, labor shortage and the Ukraine war. Apart from these, hurdles in the supply and distribution channels stemming from the pandemic and the Ukraine war have been impacting the availability and cost of certain raw materials. Increased logistic costs remain a concern for a number of companies operating in the space.High Pricing a Major Upside: Industry participants have been gaining from the solid pricing power of tobacco products, which also help them make up for high taxes and sometimes even lower cigarette sales volumes. As smokers don’t mind a price hike due to their addiction, this strategy is likely to keep working for players in the tobacco space. High pricing of cigarettes has been supporting revenues and operating income of some of the players in the tobacco industry.Low-Risk Products Gain Prominence: Low-risk tobacco alternatives, also referred to as next-generation tobacco products, have been gaining immense popularity. Compared to cigarettes, these products are claimed to be less detrimental to health owing to their scientific composition and manner of use. Consumers are increasingly taking to such products in a bid to quit cigarettes.Tobacco majors have been witnessing substantial revenue growth in the RRPs arena. The companies are making investments to expand in this category, such as undertaking innovations to make these products user friendly and energy efficient. The performance of tobacco players is expected to continue benefiting from RRPs. That said, the FDA is keeping a close tab on the manufacturing and marketing policies of such items to regulate their usage among the youth.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Tobacco industry is housed within the broader Zacks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #193, which places it in the bottom 23% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gradually losing confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential. Since the beginning of August 2022, the industry’s earnings estimate for 2022 has declined 3.1%.Let’s take a look at the industry’s performance and current valuation.Industry Vs. Broader MarketThe Zacks Tobacco industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector over the past year.The industry has declined 10.5% over this period compared with the broader sector’s drop of 11%. Meanwhile, the S&amp;P 500 has declined 20.2% in the said time frame.Industry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing consumer staples stocks, the industry is currently trading at 10.34X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 15.47X and the sector’s 17.39X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 18.74X, as low as 9.15X and at the median of 11.33X.3 Tobacco Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnPhilip Morris International: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is one of the industry pioneers in driving the shift from cigarettes to RRPs. The company is committed to expanding its products to more markets. It has also been making radical progress in the respiratory drug delivery platform as part of the “Beyond Nicotine"" strategy. Moreover, Philip Morris has been benefiting from its strong pricing of tobacco products.Shares of Philip Morris have declined 15.8% in the past six months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PM’s 2022 earnings per share or EPS has dropped by 0.5% in the past seven days.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Turning Point Brands: This manufacturer, marketer and distributor of branded consumer products, such as alternative smoking accessories and consumables, currently carries a Zacks Rank #3. The company is gaining from its wide market presence, including its online operations. Turning Point Brands’ Zig-Zag and Stoker’s product segments have been performing well even amid an inflationary scenario, depicting inherent strength.Turning Point Brands’ shares have dropped 35.1% in six months. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TPB’s 2022 EPS has remained unchanged over the past 30 days.22nd Century Group: The plant biotechnology company is focused on technologies that change the nicotine level in tobacco plants, as well as the cannabinoid level in hemp/cannabis plants. 22nd Century Group’s commitment toward its goal of lowering smoking-related damages by offering reduced nicotine tobacco cigarettes has been yielding well. Solid contract manufacturing sales have been driving this Zacks Rank #3 company.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 22nd Century Group’s 2022 bottom line has been stable over the past 30 days.

If you want to read about some more inflation stocks, go directly to 5 Best Inflation Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Inflationary pressures in the past few months have forced the Federal Reserve in the United States to raise rates five times this year. The total increase comes to about 3 percentage points, a figure expected to rise by 0.75 percentage points when the central bank meets again in three weeks. Inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics continues to paint a bleak picture for the economy. Per latest numbers, the producer price index, a measure of prices that US businesses get for the goods and services they produce, increased 0.4% in September. The increase excluded food, energy, and trade services and represented a 5.6% rise from a year ago. Food prices led to an increase in goods inflation, with a 1.2% monthly hike. Energy rose 0.7% after posting massive gains the previous two months. US President Joe Biden has played down risks of a recession in the US in the wake of these figures, telling CNN recently that he did not think the US would sink into a recession, but even if it did, he expected it to be a very slight one, remarking that finance experts predicted a recession every six months. Investors who are anticipating a recession in the US economy have loaded up on some of the best inflation stocks like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and The Proctor and Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as the benchmark indexes continue to register declines. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, recently told reporters that “the worst is yet to come, and for many people, 2023 will feel like a recession”. Our MethodologyThese companies that have shown historical resilience against an inflationary environment were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed.

(NYSE:PM), which we also held in the portfolio, for SEK 106 per share—a 35% premium to Swedish Match’s prior closing share price. The deal is a good fit for PM as it reduces PM’s dependence on cigarettes—a category in steady decline—and accelerates the company’s transition to smokeless “reduced-risk” products (RRPs)—a category that has experienced rapid growth over the past five years. PM can also leverage its global scale to generate significant revenue synergies from these complementary product sets, as well as quickly gain access to the US market—the world’s largest market for RRPs and one where regulators have embraced RRPs and other less harmful nicotine products. We exited our position in Swedish Match as shares approached the takeout price.”7.

88,e39a2c18-8f4b-3e76-9877-40eb58be657d,PM,2022-10-14,3 Tobacco Stocks to Watch Even Amid Industry Challenges,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-tobacco-stocks-watch-even-140602016.html,1665669962,STORY,"['PM', 'TPB']","[Stringent regulatory norms and limitations have been hurting the cigarette volumes of several players in the Tobacco industry. Also, inflation of raw material, labor and logistic costs has been a concern. That being said, robust pricing power has been an upside.Apart from this, the focus on reduced risk products (RRPs) or smoke-free alternatives has been working well for companies like Philip Morris International Inc. PM, Turning Point Brands, Inc. TPB and 22nd Century Group, Inc. XXII.About the Industry The Zacks Tobacco industry includes companies that manufacture and sell cigarettes as well as tobacco and nicotine-based products such as cigars, snuffs and oral tobacco. Some of the companies also offer reduced-risk products such as e-cigarettes, vaping and heat-not-burn variants. A few of the firms are also engaged in making devices and attachments needed in vaping and heat-not-burn products. Most of the products manufactured by the tobacco industry participants fall under the strict vigilance of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are required to follow the permissible levels of nicotine in manufacturing. Players in this space sell products mostly through large retailers, distributors, convenience stores, drugstores, wholesalers and grocery chains. Additionally, some of the international tobacco firms operate in the country through subsidiaries.4 Trends Shaping the Future of Tobacco IndustryStern Government Regulations: Cigarette volumes are being affected by strict government regulations pertaining to sales, marketing and manufacturing. Such regulatory norms are imposed due to the health hazards caused by the consumption of nicotine. Some of the guidelines issued by the FDA include the mandatory use of precautionary labels on cigarette packets and self-critical advertisements. Moreover, campaigns against tobacco consumption have led to increased consumer awareness, which has, in turn, resulted in lower smoking rates. Since cigarette sales account for the majority of revenues for companies in the tobacco industry, dwindling sales volumes in this category are a concern. On its second-quarter earnings call, Altria stated that the Biden administration introduced plans for future FDA rule-making to come up with a product standard, which would set an upper level for nicotine in cigarettes. The FDA has also proposed rules to ban menthol in cigarettes and characterizing flavors in cigars. Such headwinds, along with the rising health consciousness, have been adversely impacting cigarette sales volumes.Cost Inflation: An overall inflationary cost scenario has been hurting the performance of many industry players. Companies are witnessing elevated inflation rates due to rising global energy, commodity and food prices, due to factors like demand-supply imbalances, labor shortage and the Ukraine war. Apart from these, hurdles in the supply and distribution channels stemming from the pandemic and the Ukraine war have been impacting the availability and cost of certain raw materials. Increased logistic costs remain a concern for a number of companies operating in the space.High Pricing a Major Upside: Industry participants have been gaining from the solid pricing power of tobacco products, which also help them make up for high taxes and sometimes even lower cigarette sales volumes. As smokers don’t mind a price hike due to their addiction, this strategy is likely to keep working for players in the tobacco space. High pricing of cigarettes has been supporting revenues and operating income of some of the players in the tobacco industry.Low-Risk Products Gain Prominence: Low-risk tobacco alternatives, also referred to as next-generation tobacco products, have been gaining immense popularity. Compared to cigarettes, these products are claimed to be less detrimental to health owing to their scientific composition and manner of use. Consumers are increasingly taking to such products in a bid to quit cigarettes. Tobacco biggies have been witnessing substantial revenue growth in the RRPs arena. The companies are making investments to expand in this category, such as undertaking innovations to make these products user friendly and energy efficient. The performance of tobacco players is expected to continue benefiting from RRPs. That said, the FDA is keeping a close tab on the manufacturing and marketing policies of such items to regulate their usage among the youth.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Tobacco industry is housed within the broader Zacks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #193, which places it in the bottom 23% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

89,0c7e98fc-c0b6-3276-9374-2dfda7f6c7da,PM,2022-10-14,Philip Morris (PM) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-pm-expected-beat-140002664.html,1665669602,STORY,['PM'],"[The market expects Philip Morris (PM) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.37 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -13.3%.Revenues are expected to be $7.27 billion, down 10.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.35% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Philip Morris?For Philip Morris, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +3.34%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Philip Morris will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Philip Morris would post earnings of $1.24 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.48, delivering a surprise of +19.35%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Philip Morris appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

90,29673005-37d9-3f03-812b-61562f97fa09,PM,2022-10-14,Philip Morris International Inc. (PM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/philip-morris-international-inc-pm-130001501.html,1665666001,STORY,['PM'],"[Philip Morris (PM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this seller of Marlboro and other cigarette brands have returned -8.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -12.9% change. The Zacks Tobacco industry, to which Philip Morris belongs, has lost 7.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Philip Morris is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -13.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.75 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -5.4%. This estimate has changed -4.4% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.72 indicates a change of -0.5% from what Philip Morris is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Philip Morris is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Philip Morris, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.27 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -10.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $30.48 billion and $29.51 billion estimates indicate -2.9% and -3.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPhilip Morris reported revenues of $7.83 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.1%. EPS of $1.48 for the same period compares with $1.57 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.61 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +18.51%.

The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Philip Morris is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Philip Morris.

But it can difficult to make money in a declining market. The The Western Union Company (NYSE:WU) is down 43% over three years, but the total shareholder return is -34% once you include the dividend. That's better than the market which declined 39% over the last three years. And more recent buyers are having a tough time too, with a drop of 33% in the last year. Furthermore, it's down 15% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders. Of course, this share price action may well have been influenced by the 18% decline in the broader market, throughout the period.Since Western Union has shed US$220m from its value in the past 7 days, let's see if the longer term decline has been driven by the business' economics. Check out our latest analysis for Western Union While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the three years that the share price fell, Western Union's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 5.7% each year. This reduction in EPS is slower than the 17% annual reduction in the share price. So it's likely that the EPS decline has disappointed the market, leaving investors hesitant to buy. The less favorable sentiment is reflected in its current P/E ratio of 5.95.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Western Union has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. As it happens, Western Union's TSR for the last 3 years was -34%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Western Union returned a loss of 29% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 44%. Given the total loss of 3% per year over five years, it seems returns have deteriorated in the last twelve months. While some investors do well specializing in buying companies that are struggling (but nonetheless undervalued), don't forget that Buffett said that 'turnarounds seldom turn'. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Western Union better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Western Union  you should be aware of, and 1 of them can't be ignored.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

Higher interest rates this year have slashed prices and subsequently raised the dividends on dozens of quality stocks, with some now beginning to show signs of life.Here are three REITs with dividend yields over 6% that have been gaining momentum this week and could be signaling better times are ahead:Simon Property Group Inc. (NYSE: SPG) is an Indianapolis-based retail REIT that owns and leases shopping malls, restaurants, outlet centers and entertainment venues. A member of the S&amp;P 100, Simon Property Group is one of the largest shopping mall REITs in the U.S. and also owns properties in Europe and Asia.Simon Property Group has had its share of difficulties over the past three years, including shutdowns from COVID-19 in 2020 and, more recently, threats from inflation and the possibility of a difficult recession on the horizon.September was an extremely difficult month for most REIT stocks, and Simon Property Group’s stock fell to a recent low of $86.02 but has since bounced back to near $95. Its $7 annual dividend is now yielding 7.3%.One thing to admire about Simon Property Group is its resiliency. In 2020, when COVID-19 triggered a huge price decline, the stock traded below $37. But within 2½ years it had risen to $160. Could history repeat itself?Easterly Government Properties Inc. (NYSE: DEA) is an office REIT that acquires, develops and manages Class A commercial properties that are leased to government agencies through the General Services Administration. Easterly Government Properties owns a total of 95 properties across 26 states.Easterly Government Properties stock has a 52-week range of $14.80 to $23.65. It pays an annual dividend of $1.06, and the recent yield was 6.7%.Unless you believe that government agencies are going to default on paying their rent, it would seem that Easterly Government Properties is the proverbial “baby being thrown out with the bathwater.” The stock has seen more favorable comments from analysts lately, with two strong buy recommendations and has shown some upside over the past week. Further appreciation could be ahead.Story continuesUniversal Health Realty Income Trust (NYSE: UHT) is a healthcare REIT that owns and operates healthcare facilities such as acute care and rehabilitation hospitals, medical office buildings, free-standing emergency rooms and childcare centers. Universal Health Realty Trust has 71 properties across 20 states. About 60% of its properties are medical buildings and clinics.August and September were brutal months for Universal Health Realty Income Trust, with its stock losing about 25% of its value. However, the stock is up about 3% this week and looks to be bottoming in the low $40s. The $2.84 annual dividend yields 6.5%. The annual funds from operation (FFO) of $3.52 easily covers the dividend payout.Another favorable sign is that Chairman Alan Miller recently purchased $68,000 worth of company stock at $48.90 per share. His decision indicates that better times could be ahead for Universal Health Realty Income Trust, and its recent price action would suggest the same.Latest Real Estate Investment Insights From BenzingaRentberry, the startup that is expected to disrupt the rental market, has now raised over $11.4 million through its current funding round on StartEngine. Rentberry shares are priced at $0.87 through its current offering.The CalTier Multi-Family Portfolio Fund recently completed a new investment in lakefront multifamily and mixed-use development.

If you want to read about some more healthcare stocks, go directly to Top 5 Healthcare Stocks to Buy.Focus in the healthcare sector has steadily been shifting away from the coronavirus pandemic to diversification, vertical integration, and new business building in the past few months. According to a report by consulting firm McKinsey, innovation and growth have continued unabated in the healthcare industry despite persistent inflation in consumer prices. Volatile investment conditions and a tight labor market, however, continue to present operating and financial challenges for healthcare leaders.Stephanie Allen, a leader in the global public health and social services world, told research firm Deloitte recently that COVID-19 has accelerated numerous trends in the healthcare sector, particularly around health equity and sustainability. Allen claims that shifting consumer preferences and behavior, the integration of life sciences and healthcare sector, rapidly evolving digital health technologies, new talent and care delivery models, and clinical innovation continue to be top of mind for healthcare executives globally. Some of the top healthcare stocks to buy in this context include Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). McKinsey estimates that the healthcare sector will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6% between 2021 and 2025, adding about $31 billion in profits during the time. The firm has also warned that profits could decline by more than $70 billion during this period if inflation continues unchecked. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the healthcare sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed.

The company’s 2022 guidance was in line with Street expectations, calling for 9% to 11% operational revenue growth and modest margin expansion despite heavy investment in core growth drivers.”7.

We are further attracted to its strong management team that has a stellar track record of deploying capital, and the founding family continues to own almost a quarter of the business. We initiated a position after HCA reported Q1 earnings — it reduced full year guidance due to increased labor costs and lower-than-expected acuity among COVID admissions, dampening near-term investor sentiment.”6.

Daily cash refers to the rewards that card users generate through their purchases.The move builds on the existing credit-card partnership between the two companies. The Wall Street titan has pushed in recent years to expand its offerings for consumers, though the effort has been dogged by cost overruns and missed profitability goals. For Apple, Goldman remains a key partner even as the tech company works to shift more of its financial-services offerings in-house.The move is part of Apple’s bet that services -- including financial offerings -- will help fuel growth in coming years. Already, services contribute more than 20% of revenue, up from less than 10% in 2015. But an Apple “buy now, pay later” service, announced earlier this year, has taken longer than expected to reach the market. The offering, called Apple Pay Later, had been slated for iOS 16, software released last month in tandem with new iPhones.Apple and Goldman Sachs have also been working on a more extensive buy now, pay later service for Apple Pay that could handle larger purchase amounts with longer-term payment plans -- an expansion over the delayed, short-term Apple Pay Later service.Apple’s savings-account offering will allow Apple Card users to generate interest on their cash back, which arrives in 1%, 2% and 3% increments depending on whether the purchases were made via Apple Pay, on Apple products or with select merchants. Apple and Goldman didn’t announce an interest rate, but Marcus, Goldman’s existing savings account, currently gives users an annual percentage yield of 2.15%.Story continuesThe partnership could encourage users to store the cash they get back with Goldman rather than Green Dot Bank, Apple’s existing partner for its legacy credit card.Goldman has been eager to increase its consumer deposits.

Dow stocks are stocks listed on the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is a stock market index that includes 30 prominent companies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was created by Charles Dow and Edward Jones in 1896 as a price weighted index to track 30 large companies listed either on the NYSE or NASDAQ. It's considered as a benchmark for blue chips listed in the United States. Due to the Federal Reserve having raised interest rates 5 times this year and expectations that the central bank could increase rates even further, the Dow has dropped almost 20% and there could be more downside in the future if economic data fails to meet expectations. Given that it is comprised mainly of blue chips, the Dow has fallen less year to date than the S&amp;P 500 or the NASDAQ indexes, which have fallen around 25% and 34% respectively. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to have a well diversified portfolio across many different stocks across many different sectors. Among the blue chip stocks, here are 11 of the best we think long term investors could potentially consider adding to their portfolios.

Despite the S&amp;P 500 falling around 25% year to date and the Dow falling almost 20%, Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) shares have only fallen around 16% year to date due to the company's strong businesses. As of October 12, the company trades at a forward P/E ratio of 18.12 and has an average target price of $204.04 per share.

Meridian Funds also said the following about The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in its second quarter investor letter,We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favor The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.9. Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55 Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) discovers, develops, manufactures, and delivers human therapeutics worldwide.

(BKU) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bankunited-inc-bku-earnings-expected-140002589.html,1665669602,STORY,"['NTRS', 'BKU']","[BankUnited, Inc. (BKU) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.01 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.5%.Revenues are expected to be $262.09 million, up 18.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.71% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for BankUnited, Inc.For BankUnited, Inc.The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.32%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that BankUnited, Inc. Will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that BankUnited, Inc. Would post earnings of $0.90 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.82, delivering a surprise of -8.89%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.BankUnited, Inc. Appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Expected Results of an Industry PlayerAnother stock from the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry, Northern Trust Corporation (NTRS), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.82 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +1.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.76 billion, up 8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Northern Trust Corporation has been revised 6.6% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, an equal Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Northern Trust Corporation will beat the consensus EPS estimate.

The company’s earnings and revenues are expected to have increased from the year-ago reported figure.In the last reported quarter, NTRS’s earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate.A rising expense base and weak capital ratios were headwinds. Nonetheless, higher revenues, aided by a rise in trust, investment and other servicing fees, and net interest income (“NII”), were the driving factors.Northern Trust has a decent earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed in the other, the surprise being 4.31%, on average.Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNorthern Trust Corporation price-eps-surprise | Northern Trust Corporation QuoteNTRS’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to raise analysts’ optimism. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings of $1.82 has moved marginally downward in the past month. Nonetheless, the figure indicates a 1.1% increase from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Also, the consensus estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.77 billion, suggesting growth of 8.2% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Here are other factors that are expected to have impacted NTRS’s quarterly performance:NII: The lending environment continued to improve in the quarter under review, albeit at a slower pace.  Per the Fed’s latest data, commercial and industrial loans, real estate loans, and consumer loans slightly moderated in July and August from the second quarter. Encouragingly, commercial real estate loan growth accelerated in the quarter under review.Hence, a higher level of loans will likely aid average interest-earning assets. However, lower levels of client deposits and securities are expected to have shrunk the average balance sheet.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $133.5 million for average interest-earning assets for the quarter indicates a 4.5% decline from the last reported figure.Story continuesAlso, the Federal Reserve raised rates by 150 basis points in total in the quarter. The policy rate, thus, reached 3.0-3.25%, the highest level since 2008. Hence, boosted by higher short-term rates and improvement in the lending scenario, NIM and NII are anticipated to have improved. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII is expected to have risen 2.8% to $472 million sequentially.Fee Income: Northern Trust uses a lag effect to calculate its corporate custody and investment management fees, i.e., computations are based on the prior-quarter end valuations. The performance of equity markets was volatile in the second quarter. Hence a spike in equity trading volumes and higher client activities are likely to have registered gains for NTRS in custody, servicing and management fees in the third quarter.Also, NTRS provides the majority of its asset-management services through its Asset Servicing unit, which generates a significant portion of total revenues. Due to a decline in U.S. stock prices, global fixed-income markets and assets under management in the prior quarter, asset servicing and asset management fees are likely to have faced headwinds.Investment management fees are expected to increase primarily due to the recapture of money market fee waivers, supported by higher Fed fund rates, partially offset by unfavorable markets.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total fee income is pegged at $1.25 billion, indicating a 4.6% fall from the prior quarter’s reported figure.Expenses: NTRS’s investments in automation and wallet share deepening in the asset servicing and wealth management businesses are likely to have kept costs elevated in the quarter. These investments might aid the company over the long term, but the rising current expense level is anticipated to have curbed the bottom-line expansion in the third quarter. Costs are likely to have increased due to inflation and increased hiring.What Does the Zacks Model Say?The proven Zacks model predicts that an earnings beat is likely for Northern Trust this time around. This is because NTRS has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or higher — for increasing the odds of an earnings beat.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they are reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Northern Trust has an Earnings ESP of +0.19%.Zacks Rank: Northern Trust currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).

(NASDAQ:HOLX) Suggests It's 41% Undervalued",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-hologic-inc-nasdaq-121731452.html,1665749851,STORY,['HOLX'],"[In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Hologic, Inc. (NASDAQ:HOLX) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Hologic What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.01bUS$886.5mUS$978.0mUS$1.08bUS$1.20bUS$1.29bUS$1.36bUS$1.43bUS$1.48bUS$1.53bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 7.5%Est @ 5.84%Est @ 4.68%Est @ 3.87%Est @ 3.3% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$947US$782US$810US$837US$875US$883US$878US$863US$842US$816(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$8.5bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.5b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.5%– 2.0%) = US$35bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$35b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%)10= US$18bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$27b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$63.4, the company appears quite undervalued at a 41% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Hologic as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.965. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

118,baa816cc-cf4b-3783-ad9c-b090d59a5c0b,PSX,2022-10-14,What Makes Phillips 66 (PSX) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-phillips-66-psx-strong-160004664.html,1665676804,STORY,['PSX'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Phillips 66 (PSX), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Phillips 66 currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for PSX that show why this oil refiner shows promise as a solid momentum pick.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor PSX, shares are up 14.59% over the past week while the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is up 7.73% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 8.07% compares favorably with the industry's 0.09% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Phillips 66 have risen 7.01%, and are up 13.52% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -5.98% and -16.33%, respectively.Investors should also take note of PSX's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, PSX is averaging 4,023,031 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with PSX.Over the past two months, 3 earnings estimates moved higher compared to 1 lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PSX's consensus estimate, increasing from $15.79 to $16.45 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 6 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that PSX is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Phillips 66 on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

119,de63799d-b53a-337d-8969-107fe8218fe5,PSX,2022-10-14,3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks: A Smarter Way to Boost Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ranked-dividend-stocks-131001334.html,1665666601,STORY,['PSX'],"[Here's a revealing data point: older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future.That means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.Today's retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields - and the Social Security picture isn't too rosy either. Right now and for the near future, Social Security benefits are still being paid, but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035.So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesA rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Bank OZK (OZK) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.33 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.1%. This compares to the Banks - Northeast industry's yield of 2.18% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.81%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 12.28%. Check Bank OZK (OZK) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Paramount Group (PGRE) is paying out a dividend of $0.08 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 5.17% compared to the REIT and Equity Trust - Other industry's yield of 4.64% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 10.71% over the past year. Check Paramount Group (PGRE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.97 per share, Phillips 66 (PSX) has a dividend yield of 4.17%. This is compared to the Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry's yield of 1.69% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 7.78%. Check Phillips 66 (PSX) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?The fact is that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds. To counterbalance this, invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly, can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LinePursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, due to some key factors, dividend-paying stocks in the same space are relatively less volatile, thereby making Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC, Valero Energy Corporation VLO and Phillips 66 PSX well-poised to gain.Extremely Volatile Energy MarketWe should not forget how oil prices have behaved since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020.However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which in turn led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Dividend Stocks to the RescueOverall oil pricing scenario seems scary, which could easily deter an investor from allocating money to energy companies. Despite this volatility constraint, investors could consider dividend-paying companies belonging to the industry. This is because, generally, companies with stable dividend-paying history are usually relatively less volatile than stocks with no dividend history. It is expected that companies that have been rewarding stockholders with dividends will try their best to continue paying at the same pace or higher, making the stocks attractive and less volatile to the vagaries of the market.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three such stocks. Two of the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while one carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). With a dividend yield of more than 2%, all the companies have raised dividends over the past five years. Moreover, with a payout ratio of less than 60%, the companies ensure sustainability with enough scope for future dividend increases.Story continues3 Stocks in the SpotlightMarathon Petroleum Corporation: As a leading, integrated, downstream energy player, Marathon Petroleum is the operator of the largest refining system in the nation. Handsome margins and throughput in all regions are aiding MPC. #1 Ranked Marathon Petroleum pays out a quarterly dividend of 58 cents ($2.32 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.21% yield at the current stock price.

I expect 2023 to be just as strong, even with nearing patent expirations on its Humira drug.Helping ABBV just increased its quarterly dividend to $1.48 a share from $1.41, or $5.92 annualized. The stock has a current yield of 3.62%.Sure, its $200 billion Humira drug lost protection in Europe and will face increased competition from biosimilars in 2023, but don’t write the stock off just yet. In fact, we have to remember that the company’s Skyrizi and Rinvoq drugs could bring in about $15 billion in sales over the next three years. That alone should take away the sting of Humira. Enbridge (ENB)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy.

It’s payable on March 1 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 15, 2023. Moving forward, Enbridge reiterated its 2022 full-year revenue guidance for adjusted EBITDA of $15 billion to $15.6 billion.Story continuesIt also announced 2023 EBITDA guidance of $15.9 billion to $16.5 billion. In short, Enbridge should have quite a year in 2023. W.P. Carey (WPC)stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes DSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.comWhen inflation is running hot, take a look at WP Carey (NYSE:WPC), a net lease real estate investment trust that buys properties directly from companies, and then leases them back to an oftentimes reliable tenant. It’s also called a lease-back.Or, where “a company sells its real estate to an investor like W. P. Carey for cash and simultaneously enters into a long-term lease. In doing so, the company extracts 100% of the property’s value and converts an otherwise illiquid asset into working capital to reinvest in its business or pay down debt, while maintaining operational control,” as noted by the company.What’s interesting about WP Carey is nearly all of its rental agreements include contractual rent increases for inflation, according to BNK Invest. In fact, about 60% of the agreements are tied to the consumer price index. Well diversified with industrial, warehouse, office, retail, and self-storage, the REIT also pays a dividend yield of 5.45%.Agree Realty (ADC)Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockWith a yield of 4.17%, Agree Realty (NYSE:ADC) is another interesting real estate company I’ve been focusing on. Much of this has to do with the company’s business model, which is aimed at acquiring and developing properties that are net leased to industry-leading omnichannel retail tenants.At the moment, this company has just under 36 million square feet of space it leases to those reliable investment-grade tenants. Better, as of Sept., the company acquired another 303 properties across 42 states for about $1.19 billion.This company’s growing property portfolio has allowed it to recently increase its monthly dividend to 24 cents per share, which amounts to $2.88 per share annualized. Even more impressive are its recent earnings. In its second quarter, the company posted revenue of $104.9 million, as compared to expectations of $102.3 million. Agree also increased its full-year acquisition guidance to a new range of $1.5 billion to $1.7 billion.Coca-Cola (KO)a line of Coca-Cola (KO) cansSource: MAHATHIR MOHD YASIN / Shutterstock.comWith strong demand, dependable dividends, and incredible earnings growth, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) may be one of the best dividend stocks to consider as a long-term investment.Coca-Cola is also a dividend king, raising its dividend for the last 60+ years. This stock currently carries a yield of 2.83% and continues to be one of the safest stocks on the market. In addition, in its most recent quarter, the company posted earnings per share of 69 cents on sales of $11.1 billion.That’s up from the 65 cents on sales of $10 billion during the same quarter last year. Analysts were looking for 64 cents on sales of $10.5 billion.For the year, the company expects revenue growth to fall in the range of 14% and 15%, which is higher than its initial forecast of 12% to 13%. Coca-Cola also raised its growth estimates on adjusted earnings per share to a new range of 6% to 7%, from 5% to 6%.Also company director Herb Allen just bought 33,200 shares for $2 million. That’s reason enough for me to recommend it as one of the best dividend stocks for grandkids.Arbor Realty Trust (ABR)the Arbor Realty Trust (ABR) logo on a web browser, magnified by a magnifying glassSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comArbor Realty Trust (NYSE:ABR) carries a dividend yield of 11.71%, and is also a REIT I’d put in the oversold camp.The company also raised its cash dividend to 40 cents, its 10th consecutive quarterly increase. That was payable back in November. However, we do expect to see another increase to be announced in the near term.Company earnings have also been solid.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this gold and copper miner have returned -2.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -12.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Mining - Miscellaneous industry, which Newmont falls in, has lost 8.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Newmont is expected to post earnings of $0.50 per share, indicating a change of -16.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.47 points to a change of -16.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -5.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.70 indicates a change of +9.2% from what Newmont is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Newmont.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NEM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Newmont, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.16 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +9.3%. For the current and next fiscal years, $12.4 billion and $12.58 billion estimates indicate +1.4% and +1.5% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNewmont reported revenues of $3.06 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.2%. EPS of $0.46 for the same period compares with $0.83 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.07 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.5%. The EPS surprise was -23.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Newmont is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Newmont. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more industrial dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.The industrial sector has been dealing with the twin pressures of labor shortages and supply chain disruptions as macro uncertainties like inflation and rising rates batter the economy. According to a report by research firm Deloitte, there is likely to be a shortfall of 2.1 million skilled jobs by 2030. This environment has kept the optimism around revenue growth in the sector in check even as the economic recovery in the post-pandemic world gathers pace with the lifting of virus restrictions and the resumption of international travel. Another important factor influencing growth in the industrial space is the challenges to transportation that are likely to continue beyond 2022. Some of these include driver shortages in trucking and congestion at US container ports. As demand outpaces supply, higher costs are more likely to be passed on to customers, per Deloitte. However, an acceleration in digital technology adoption could bring operational efficiencies to scale in this regard. Sustainability initiatives are also important and factoring into cost of capital. Investors who want to look for solid companies with reliable dividend track records to ride the upcoming market storm should invest in some of the best industrial stocks like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM). Research firm RSM US claims that investments in resilient supply chains and digital tech, in light of geopolitical tensions and rising inflation, will be the two most important trends shaping the future of the industrial world.Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the industrial sector and have solid dividend profiles were selected for the list. The firms with dividend yields above 1.5% as of October 13 and a more than 10-year track record of payouts were preferred. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues10 Best Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy NowChristian Lagerek/Shutterstock.comBest Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy Now10. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33      Dividend Yield as of October 13: 2.72%Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) engages in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. It is one of the best industrial stocks to invest in. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)'s near-term revenue growth should benefit from healthy demand in the commodity-related and capital goods markets. With the opening of onsite locations and the installation of FMIs, the long-term growth prospects for the company look solid as well.On July 15, Argus analyst John Eade kept a Buy rating on Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) stock and lowered the price target to $55 from $66, noting that the company’s core business trends remained positive.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 33 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $893 million in Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST), compared to 29 the preceding quarter worth $1 billion.Just like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) is one of the best industrial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, Nomadic Value Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In mid-June we completely sold out of Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST). Although we had been using FAST as a source of liquidity for a few months already, it still feels bad to say an official goodbye to such an amazing company. However, we must stay focused on the math and the math concludes a difficult task to get our return hurdle going forward. The last time FAST traded at a forward P/E ratio of 34x (the multiple at our exit), the year was 2012. The company had been growing at 20% per year, and the US was about to embark on a shale oil boom, sustaining a low-teens growth trajectory. Today, FAST’s sales growth could turn anemic as the surge for COVID safety products is waning and heavy construction and resources customers are slow to return. An investor must have an optimistic view towards 5+ years of strong real GDP growth as well as sustained inflation. If one lowers the growth assumption to a more likely outcome, then the implicit bet is that low to negative real interest rates will persist and the forward P/E multiple will stay elevated4. I do not want to make such a strong macro bet as the justification for owning a stock. Fastenal is a cyclical business with a growth model proven to take market share secularly, but the time to buy FAST (the stock) will be when we are in the depths of an industrial recession. Stay tuned.”9. Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33  Dividend Yield as of October 13: 2.83%Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

(NYSE:APD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“This quarter we are highlighting Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) as a relative yield example in the Materials sector. APD is a leading global industrial gas supply company and is the largest supplier of hydrogen and helium in the world. It has a sustainable competitive advantage due to long-term customer relationships and contracts, high customer switching costs, and the mission critical nature of its products. Industrial gases are a relatively small fraction of customers’ overall costs but are crucial to ensure uninterrupted production.Our thesis on APD is that it appears well-positioned for consistent double-digit growth due to a large multi-year capital allocation plan, and the need for accelerating capital expenditures by its customers. It has a $25 billion backlog driven by traditional gas investments along with new growth opportunities like gasification, green hydrogen, and carbon capture.

If you want to read about some more industrial stocks, go directly to 5 Best Industrial Stocks To Buy Now.The United States economy in 2022 has not been as vibrant as 2021. In fact, soaring inflation and rising interest rates have combined to raise recession fears and resulted in a broad selloff at the stock market, pushing down benchmark indexes and turning investors away from even value-oriented sectors such as financials, industrials, materials and energy. However, as travel demand picks up again, inflation cools down, and infrastructure spending ramps up, industrial stocks in particular seem well-positioned to make a strong comeback. Some of the best industrial stocks to buy in this context include TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM). Another catalyst for industrial stocks is the Russian war in Ukraine that has led to increased defense spending around the world. A quick solution to the war seems increasingly unlikely. Thus, aerospace and defense stocks are poised to outperform the broader industry in the coming months. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the industrial sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.13 Best Industrial Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Lenny Kuhne on UnsplashBest Industrial Stocks To Buy Now13.

Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35 Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) manufactures and sells motion and control technologies and systems for various mobile, industrial, and aerospace markets worldwide.

Here is what the fund said:“Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), a U.S. company that specializes in motion and control technologies, is suffering from what we believe are investor misunderstandings and misjudgements, despite the efforts of the company’s unusually strong management team. In our opinion, since his promotion in 2015, CEO Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the product portfolio to longer cycled, higher growth, higher margin and higher return end markets. The results are impressive. Margins, returns and earnings have increased substantially. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition in the September quarter, the highly depressed aerospace segment will be its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which—combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses, including clean technologies and factory automation—should accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be similar or better. At a low-teens multiple of next year’s normalized cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.”11. Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36   Cummins Inc.

Brussels says a new index is needed since the TTF is driven by pipeline supply and no longer represents a market that includes more LNG.It remains unclear if EU leaders will agree to a ""temporary market intervention"" - wording that could refer to a gas price cap that has proved divisive.Belgian Prime Minister Alexander De Croo warned a unilateral cap on electricity prices called for by the national opposition could lead to power being sold in other markets and blackouts in Belgium, the heart of the EU.British shoppers are meanwhile responding to the risk of power cuts by stocking-up on portable generators and torches, in addition to winter clothing, thermal underwear and candles.

The company expects the plant to return to at least partial service in November.The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said in a filing on Thursday that Freeport has not yet started construction of the fourth train.Freeport said the project was delayed by the replacement of its engineering, procurement and construction contractor and the COVID-19 pandemic, including the pandemic’s effects on the global supply chain and the impact on global LNG demand.However, Freeport said demand for LNG has rebounded and it has been actively negotiating with potential off-take customers.Natural gas prices in Europe are up about 111% this year as LNG demand soars after supply disruptions and sanctions linked to Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine.Freeport said it will take about 48 to 56 months to build the new fourth train, which made it impossible to meet the previous FERC deadline of May 2026.FERC first approved construction of the fourth train in May 2019, requiring Freeport to finish it by May 2023.In September 2020 FERC extended the deadline to May 2026.The three trains already at Freeport can turn about 2.1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas into LNG.Freeport's customers include units of Osaka Gas Co, JERA, BP, TotalEnergies and SK E&amp;S.

The move is to support crude prices, which have been hit by worries that global recession will harm demand.White House officials are worried the cut to production quotas could end up undermining the G7 effort to cap the price of Russian oil. The Biden administration has been trying to persuade countries to help it keep a lid on oil prices, which would hit Moscow's revenues and keep US gas prices in check.It has accused OPEC of ""aligning with Russia"", and President Joe Biden and other lawmakers have vowed there will be ""consequences"" for Saudi Arabia.Story continuesKirby said Saudi Arabia knew the reductions would increase Russian revenues and curb the effectiveness of Western sanctions on Moscow after it invaded Ukraine.His comments came after the Saudi foreign ministry posted a defense of the OPEC output cuts earlier Thursday. It said the move, meant to tackle volatility in the oil market, took the balance of supply and demand into account and was a consensus decision.Kirby pushed back against against that position.""The Saudi foreign ministry can try to spin or deflect, but the facts are simple,"" he said.""As the President has said, we are reevaluating our relationship with Saudi Arabia in light of these actions, and will continue to look for signs about where they stand in combatting Russian aggression.""The Biden administration has been trying to curb gas prices at the pump for American drivers in the lead-up to the November midterm elections.At last check Friday, Brent crude, the international benchmark, was up 0.17% to trade at $94.70 a barrel.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

134,4780e9fa-0437-3c88-9e76-ab5a31cec0fc,NOV,2022-10-14,Bull of the Day: Marathon Petroleum Corp. (MPC),Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bull-day-marathon-petroleum-corp-100010326.html,1665741610,STORY,"['CL=F', 'NG=F', 'MPC']","[Marathon Petroleum MPC, a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), has been a substantial beneficiary of the energy surge this year. The stock has gone on to rally to new all-time highs while the general market continues to hover in bear territory. With inflation stubbornly lingering as we’ve seen over the past few months, MPC is set to continue its dominant trend. MPC sports the highest-possible ‘A’ rating in each of our Zacks Value, Growth, and Momentum Style Score categories, indicating an increased likelihood that the stock continues to propel higher. The powerful combination of relative undervaluation and positive earnings estimate revisions should serve bullish MPC investors well into the future.Marathon Petroleum is a component of the Zacks Oil &amp; Gas – Refining and Marketing industry, which currently ranks in the top 1% out of approximately 250 industry groups. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. Also note the favorable characteristics for this group below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuantitative research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s future price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. By targeting stocks contained within leading industry groups, we can dramatically improve our odds of success.Company DescriptionMarathon Petroleum, headquartered in Findlay, Ohio, is engaged in refining, transporting and marketing of petroleum products. MPC also manufactures aromatics, propane, propylene, and sulfur. The company sells refined products to wholesale marketing customers in the United States and internationally.MPC stores and distributes crude oil through pipelines, terminals, and barges. Furthermore, it gathers and transports natural gas liquids. Operating in 37 states, the District of Columbia, and Mexico, the energy giant was founded in 1887.Recent Earnings and Future Estimates MPC has been on a hot streak in terms of earnings surprises, beating estimates in each of the past four quarters – with an average beat of 56.68%. Back in August, the company reported Q2 EPS of $10.61/share, a +15.7% surprise over the $9.17 consensus estimate. When a company is consistently exceeding estimates by this wide of a margin, it typically creates a ‘tailwind’ and boosts price momentum.Story continuesRevenues for the second quarter of $54.2 billion also topped estimates by 63.08%. MPC has surpassed revenue estimates in each of the last four quarters.In the past 60 days, analysts have raised their Q3 EPS projections by +9.02%. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $6.89 per share, reflecting astounding growth of 843.84% relative to the same quarter last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCharting the CourseMPC is up nearly 75% this year alone, widely outperforming the major indices. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to weather bear markets and corrections so gracefully. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. And as we know, MPC has seen a recent batch of positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and MPC continues to post earnings beats), the stock should continue its bullish run into next year.Other Factors to ConsiderMarathon Petroleum remains focused on enhancing shareholder value. The company currently pays a $2.23 (2.2%) dividend.In addition, MPC repurchased $4.1 billion worth of shares during Q2 and has now completed more than 80% of its target to buy back $15 billion in common stock.Bottom LineAs an established veteran in the industry, MPC trends remain favorable amid strength in the energy sector. Buoyed by an undervalued and leading industry group along with a maximum overall Zacks VGM score of ‘A’, it’s not difficult to see why MPC is a compelling investment.A history of large earnings surprises along with a strong technical trend certainly warrant a closer look at this top-rated stock. Recent positive earnings estimate revisions should also serve to create a ‘floor’ in terms of any sudden or unexpected downside moves. If you’re looking for a way to diversify your portfolio, make sure to put MPC on your shortlist.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:ZTS) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Zoetis The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At ZoetisIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, Catherine Knupp, sold US$2.2m worth of shares at a price of US$217 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$149).

If you want to read about some more healthcare stocks, go directly to Top 5 Healthcare Stocks to Buy.Focus in the healthcare sector has steadily been shifting away from the coronavirus pandemic to diversification, vertical integration, and new business building in the past few months. According to a report by consulting firm McKinsey, innovation and growth have continued unabated in the healthcare industry despite persistent inflation in consumer prices. Volatile investment conditions and a tight labor market, however, continue to present operating and financial challenges for healthcare leaders.Stephanie Allen, a leader in the global public health and social services world, told research firm Deloitte recently that COVID-19 has accelerated numerous trends in the healthcare sector, particularly around health equity and sustainability. Allen claims that shifting consumer preferences and behavior, the integration of life sciences and healthcare sector, rapidly evolving digital health technologies, new talent and care delivery models, and clinical innovation continue to be top of mind for healthcare executives globally. Some of the top healthcare stocks to buy in this context include Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ). McKinsey estimates that the healthcare sector will grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6% between 2021 and 2025, adding about $31 billion in profits during the time. The firm has also warned that profits could decline by more than $70 billion during this period if inflation continues unchecked. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the healthcare sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continuesTop 10 Healthcare Stocks to Buywavebreakmedia/Shutterstock.comTop Healthcare Stocks to Buy10.

It has a strong market presence in highly attractive geographies with growing populations and low unemployment, such as Texas and Florida, which leads to a favorable payor mix. We are further attracted to its strong management team that has a stellar track record of deploying capital, and the founding family continues to own almost a quarter of the business. We initiated a position after HCA reported Q1 earnings — it reduced full year guidance due to increased labor costs and lower-than-expected acuity among COVID admissions, dampening near-term investor sentiment.”6.

(NEE) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nextera-energy-inc-nee-trending-130001902.html,1665666001,STORY,"['NEE', 'NEE-PR']","[NextEra Energy (NEE) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this parent company of Florida Power &amp; Light Co. Have returned -18.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -12.9% change. The Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, to which NextEra belongs, has lost 20.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, NextEra is expected to post earnings of $0.77 per share, indicating a change of +2.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.89 points to a change of +13.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.13 indicates a change of +8.4% from what NextEra is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for NextEra.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for NEE _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of NextEra, the consensus sales estimate of $6.28 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +43.7%. The $20.2 billion and $26.32 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +18.3% and +30.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNextEra reported revenues of $5.18 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +32%. EPS of $0.81 for the same period compares with $0.71 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -8.77%. The EPS surprise was +8%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.NextEra is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about NextEra. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It does not require any second device to pair with and features robust Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity.Terminal enables merchants to accept payments from customers via credit cards, digital wallets,PayPal and Venmo QR Codes, seamlessly and securely.It also helps businesses in sales, inventory, reporting and payments management.We believe that all these features will aid the company in gaining solid momentum among small businesses, which, in turn, will strengthen its seller base.The latest move is likely to boost the total number of payment transactions and total payment volume (TPV) in the days ahead.In second-quarter 2022, PayPal’s total number of payment transactions was 5.5 billion, up 16% on a year-over-year basis. TPV amounted to $339.8 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9% on a spot rate basis and 13% on a currency-neutral basis.PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price and ConsensusPayPal Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-chart | PayPal Holdings, Inc. QuoteGrowing Focus on Small BusinessesWe note that the latest move bodes well for PayPal’s growing efforts toward strengthening offerings for small businesses.Apart from the latest move, the company recently launched PayPal Business Cashback Mastercard, its business credit card backed by Mastercard and issued by WebBank, with the help of which it strives to cater to the daily financing needs of small businesses.Expanding the global reach of PayPal Business Debit Mastercard remains noteworthy. Notably, the card, which is ideal for small businesses, does not carry any monthly fees or foreign exchange fees. The card allows users to access the funds stored in their PayPal accounts at more than 52 million Mastercard acceptance locations throughout the world.The company offers PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loans, which are focused on catering to the needs of small businesses.We believe that all these endeavors will boost the small merchant base of PayPal, which, in turn, will drive its top-line growth in the days ahead.Story continuesGrowing Digital Payment InitiativesThe latest move is in sync with the company’s strengthening digital payment endeavors.In addition to the latest launch, PayPal’s unveiling of a payment card, namely the PayPal Cashback credit card issued by Synchrony, remains a positive. The card allows customers to gain more rewards while shopping online and offline, and paying with PayPal.The card offers a 3% cash back when paying with PayPal at checkout — online, mobile, or in-store with PayPal QR Code. It gives an unlimited 2% cash back on all other purchases made through Mastercard, wherever accepted.PayPal’s partnership with United, under which PayPal QR Code was made available as a payment option for passengers on boarding flights of the latter, remains noteworthy.We believe that all the above-mentioned efforts will continue to expand PayPal’s footprint in the booming digital payment world.Per a report from Statista, this market is expected to generate a transaction value of $8.7 trillion in 2022, which is expected to see a CAGR of 12.8% between 2022 and 2026, and hit $14.1 trillion by 2026.We believe that the company’s growing prospects in this promising market will help it win investor confidence in the near term.Notably, PayPal has lost 55.5% on a year-to-date basis compared with the industry’s decline of 57.5%.Zacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderCurrently, PayPal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the broader Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector can consider some better-ranked stocks like Arista Networks ANET, Agilent Technologies A and Aspen Technology AZPN.

Chipmakers still flashing warning signs with the latest headlines from Taiwan Semi adding to the gloom. The Taiwanese group cutting its budget for 2022, but shares higher on better than expected results. For more, we have Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre. Ines, more gloom for the chip sector under a lot of pressure already.INES FERRE: Yeah, that's right. And if we look at the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, I mean, right now, it's rebounding. But it had opened lower. It was down as much as 4% earlier today. And a four-day chart will show you that it's down 5%, and a year to date chart shows it is down 43%.But let's get to that chip sector that you were just mentioning. And TSMC, that it beat on the top and the bottom line, cutting capital spending and also warning about slowing consumer demand. So moving into the fourth quarter, TSMC warning that it's seeing demand flattish. Right now, it's rebounding. The stock is up 7%.But I also just want to mention that, look, the chip sector has been dealing with the fallout of the new government regulations, the Biden administration's export controls. So you've got Applied Materials, Lam Research, Applied Materials saying that their fourth quarter is going to be impacted by this new regulation. So you've got this regulation on the one hand, and then you've got some of these chip makers that are talking about slowing consumer demand, on the other hand, impacting.And keep in mind that the chip sector also is going through periodic cycles. So it was expected that in the second half of the year, that we would see demand slowed down, slower. And it's-- these stocks are such that they've kind of been the way the pandemic style stocks have been-- really high during the pandemic and then losing steam this year. Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Hey, we don't need any nuance on that. We know the hit that they've been taking, and a lot of green on that board. It was red quite a bit earlier.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like QUALCOMM (NASDAQ:QCOM). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for QUALCOMM How Fast Is QUALCOMM Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Over the last three years, QUALCOMM has grown earnings per share (EPS) at as impressive rate from a relatively low point, resulting in a three year percentage growth rate that isn't particularly indicative of expected future performance. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. QUALCOMM's EPS skyrocketed from US$8.13 to US$11.45, in just one year; a result that's bound to bring a smile to shareholders. That's a fantastic gain of 41%.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. The music to the ears of QUALCOMM shareholders is that EBIT margins have grown from 32% to 36% in the last 12 months and revenues are on an upwards trend as well. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of QUALCOMM's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Story continuesAre QUALCOMM Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since QUALCOMM has a market capitalisation of US$122b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$141m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.1% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Does QUALCOMM Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?You can't deny that QUALCOMM has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. Further, the high level of insider ownership is impressive and suggests that the management appreciates the EPS growth and has faith in QUALCOMM's continuing strength. The growth and insider confidence is looked upon well and so it's worthwhile to investigate further with a view to discern the stock's true value. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for QUALCOMM   (of which 1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) you should know about.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

FHN.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Large-Cap Stocks Likely to Beat on Q3 EarningsU.S. stock markets are set for the third-quarter 2022 earnings season commencing this week.  Market participants will keenly watch this earnings season as it will provide the most descriptive view of U.S. corporate health amid record-high inflation and an extremely hawkish Fed.In addition to revenues and the net profit numbers of companies, several metrics of margins, like gross margin, operating margin and net margin will be of immense importance to investors this earnings cycle. Moreover, the outlook of U.S. corporations will guide the next course of Wall Street’s movement.Our estimates for third-quarter earnings of the market’s benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 Index, have shown a gradual decline in the past three and a half months. As of Oct 12, per our estimation for the third quarter as a whole, total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index will rise a mere 0.1% year over year on 9.1% higher revenues.We have identified five large-cap stocks that are set to beat on third-quarter earnings. Investment in these stocks should be fruitful as an earnings beat is expected to drive stock prices going forward. These companies are — Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group Inc., Lockheed Martin Corp., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and First Horizon Corp.Q3 at a GlanceLike the first half, the third quarter of 2022 also remained tough for the U.S. economy. Various measures of inflation remained elevated at a 40-year high. The Fed has hiked the benchmark interest rate by 3% so far in 2022 and it was in the range of 3.25% to 3.5% at the end of the third quarter. Moreover, the central bank has started to reduce the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet systematically since June.Story continuesDespite these aggressive monetary policies adopted by the Fed, inflation is showing no signs of declining. The complete devastation of the global supply-chain system and the shortage of labor continued to put pressure on businesses in the form of higher input costs and wages.The lingering war between Russia and Ukraine and the lockdown in China due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections were the major hindrances to the restoration of the global supply-chain system. Agencies like the IMF, the World Bank and the OECD have warned of a possible global recession in 2023.Stocks in FocusFive large-cap companies will report third-quarter 2022 earnings within the next seven days.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $84.5 million, the contract is scheduled to be completed by October 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will offer CFM56-7B27A/3 and CFM56-7B27AE engine depot-level maintenance and repair for P-8A Poseidon jets.The contract will serve the U.S. Navy, the government of Australia and foreign military sales customers. The majority of the work related to this deal will be executed in Atlanta, GA.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, being one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.9%.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed Martin boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.4%. The stock boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 64.46%.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Some of Textron’s renowned products include Beechcraft T-6C trainer and AT-6 Wolverine.Textron boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.5%.

If you want to read about some more industrial dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.The industrial sector has been dealing with the twin pressures of labor shortages and supply chain disruptions as macro uncertainties like inflation and rising rates batter the economy. According to a report by research firm Deloitte, there is likely to be a shortfall of 2.1 million skilled jobs by 2030. This environment has kept the optimism around revenue growth in the sector in check even as the economic recovery in the post-pandemic world gathers pace with the lifting of virus restrictions and the resumption of international travel. Another important factor influencing growth in the industrial space is the challenges to transportation that are likely to continue beyond 2022. Some of these include driver shortages in trucking and congestion at US container ports. As demand outpaces supply, higher costs are more likely to be passed on to customers, per Deloitte. However, an acceleration in digital technology adoption could bring operational efficiencies to scale in this regard. Sustainability initiatives are also important and factoring into cost of capital. Investors who want to look for solid companies with reliable dividend track records to ride the upcoming market storm should invest in some of the best industrial stocks like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM). Research firm RSM US claims that investments in resilient supply chains and digital tech, in light of geopolitical tensions and rising inflation, will be the two most important trends shaping the future of the industrial world.Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the industrial sector and have solid dividend profiles were selected for the list. The firms with dividend yields above 1.5% as of October 13 and a more than 10-year track record of payouts were preferred. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues10 Best Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy NowChristian Lagerek/Shutterstock.comBest Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy Now10. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33      Dividend Yield as of October 13: 2.72%Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) engages in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. It is one of the best industrial stocks to invest in. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)'s near-term revenue growth should benefit from healthy demand in the commodity-related and capital goods markets. With the opening of onsite locations and the installation of FMIs, the long-term growth prospects for the company look solid as well.On July 15, Argus analyst John Eade kept a Buy rating on Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) stock and lowered the price target to $55 from $66, noting that the company’s core business trends remained positive.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 33 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $893 million in Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST), compared to 29 the preceding quarter worth $1 billion.Just like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) is one of the best industrial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, Nomadic Value Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In mid-June we completely sold out of Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST). Although we had been using FAST as a source of liquidity for a few months already, it still feels bad to say an official goodbye to such an amazing company. However, we must stay focused on the math and the math concludes a difficult task to get our return hurdle going forward. The last time FAST traded at a forward P/E ratio of 34x (the multiple at our exit), the year was 2012. The company had been growing at 20% per year, and the US was about to embark on a shale oil boom, sustaining a low-teens growth trajectory. Today, FAST’s sales growth could turn anemic as the surge for COVID safety products is waning and heavy construction and resources customers are slow to return. An investor must have an optimistic view towards 5+ years of strong real GDP growth as well as sustained inflation. If one lowers the growth assumption to a more likely outcome, then the implicit bet is that low to negative real interest rates will persist and the forward P/E multiple will stay elevated4. I do not want to make such a strong macro bet as the justification for owning a stock. Fastenal is a cyclical business with a growth model proven to take market share secularly, but the time to buy FAST (the stock) will be when we are in the depths of an industrial recession. Stay tuned.”9. Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33  Dividend Yield as of October 13: 2.83%Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

APD is a leading global industrial gas supply company and is the largest supplier of hydrogen and helium in the world. It has a sustainable competitive advantage due to long-term customer relationships and contracts, high customer switching costs, and the mission critical nature of its products. Industrial gases are a relatively small fraction of customers’ overall costs but are crucial to ensure uninterrupted production.Our thesis on APD is that it appears well-positioned for consistent double-digit growth due to a large multi-year capital allocation plan, and the need for accelerating capital expenditures by its customers. It has a $25 billion backlog driven by traditional gas investments along with new growth opportunities like gasification, green hydrogen, and carbon capture. APD’s gasification technologies help improve energy efficiency and independence, which is a key focus for its customers.

166,cbde3fda-e457-3304-ab93-4b140d2c2954,LMT,2022-10-14,Should You Be Impressed By Lockheed Martin Corporation's (NYSE:LMT) ROE?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/impressed-lockheed-martin-corporations-nyse-140058592.html,1665669658,STORY,['LMT'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Lockheed Martin is:41% = US$4.7b ÷ US$11b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.41 in profit.Does Lockheed Martin Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Lockheed Martin has a superior ROE than the average (10%) in the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry.roeThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk .  Our risks dashboardshould have the 3 risks we have identified for Lockheed Martin.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesLockheed Martin's Debt And Its 41% ROELockheed Martin does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.02. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.But note: Lockheed Martin may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

Moreover, the outlook of U.S. corporates will guide the next course of Wall Street’s movement.Our estimates for third-quarter earnings of the market’s benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 Index, has shown a gradual decline in the past three and a half months. As of Oct 12, per our estimation for the third quarter as a whole, total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index will rise a mere 0.1% year over year on 9.1% higher revenues.We have identified five large-cap stocks that are set to beat on third-quarter earnings. Investment in these stocks should be fruitful as an earnings beat is expected to drive stock prices going forward. These companies are — Morgan Stanley MS, UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL and First Horizon Corp. FHN.Q3 at a GlanceLike the first half, the third quarter of 2022 also remained tough for the U.S. economy. Various measures of inflation remained elevated at a 40-year high. The Fed has hiked the benchmark interest rate by 3% so far in 2022 and it was in the range of 3.25% to 3.5% at the end of the third quarter. Moreover, the central bank has started to reduce the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet systematically since June.Despite these aggressive monetary policies adopted by the Fed, inflation is showing no signs of declining. The complete devastation of the global supply-chain system and the shortage of labor continued to put pressure on businesses in the form of higher input costs and wages.Story continuesThe lingering war between Russia and Ukraine and the lockdown in China due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections were the major hindrances to the restoration of the global supply-chain system. Agencies like the IMF, the World Bank and the OECD have warned of a possible global recession in 2023.Stocks in FocusFive large-cap companies will report third-quarter 2022 earnings within the next seven days.

The total increase comes to about 3 percentage points, a figure expected to rise by 0.75 percentage points when the central bank meets again in three weeks. Inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics continues to paint a bleak picture for the economy. Per latest numbers, the producer price index, a measure of prices that US businesses get for the goods and services they produce, increased 0.4% in September. The increase excluded food, energy, and trade services and represented a 5.6% rise from a year ago. Food prices led to an increase in goods inflation, with a 1.2% monthly hike. Energy rose 0.7% after posting massive gains the previous two months. US President Joe Biden has played down risks of a recession in the US in the wake of these figures, telling CNN recently that he did not think the US would sink into a recession, but even if it did, he expected it to be a very slight one, remarking that finance experts predicted a recession every six months. Investors who are anticipating a recession in the US economy have loaded up on some of the best inflation stocks like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc.

PM can also leverage its global scale to generate significant revenue synergies from these complementary product sets, as well as quickly gain access to the US market—the world’s largest market for RRPs and one where regulators have embraced RRPs and other less harmful nicotine products.

If you want to read about some more industrial dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.The industrial sector has been dealing with the twin pressures of labor shortages and supply chain disruptions as macro uncertainties like inflation and rising rates batter the economy. According to a report by research firm Deloitte, there is likely to be a shortfall of 2.1 million skilled jobs by 2030. This environment has kept the optimism around revenue growth in the sector in check even as the economic recovery in the post-pandemic world gathers pace with the lifting of virus restrictions and the resumption of international travel. Another important factor influencing growth in the industrial space is the challenges to transportation that are likely to continue beyond 2022. Some of these include driver shortages in trucking and congestion at US container ports. As demand outpaces supply, higher costs are more likely to be passed on to customers, per Deloitte. However, an acceleration in digital technology adoption could bring operational efficiencies to scale in this regard. Sustainability initiatives are also important and factoring into cost of capital. Investors who want to look for solid companies with reliable dividend track records to ride the upcoming market storm should invest in some of the best industrial stocks like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM). Research firm RSM US claims that investments in resilient supply chains and digital tech, in light of geopolitical tensions and rising inflation, will be the two most important trends shaping the future of the industrial world.Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the industrial sector and have solid dividend profiles were selected for the list. The firms with dividend yields above 1.5% as of October 13 and a more than 10-year track record of payouts were preferred. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues10 Best Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy NowChristian Lagerek/Shutterstock.comBest Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy Now10. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33      Dividend Yield as of October 13: 2.72%Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) engages in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. It is one of the best industrial stocks to invest in. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)'s near-term revenue growth should benefit from healthy demand in the commodity-related and capital goods markets. With the opening of onsite locations and the installation of FMIs, the long-term growth prospects for the company look solid as well.On July 15, Argus analyst John Eade kept a Buy rating on Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) stock and lowered the price target to $55 from $66, noting that the company’s core business trends remained positive.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 33 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $893 million in Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST), compared to 29 the preceding quarter worth $1 billion.Just like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) is one of the best industrial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, Nomadic Value Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In mid-June we completely sold out of Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST). Although we had been using FAST as a source of liquidity for a few months already, it still feels bad to say an official goodbye to such an amazing company. However, we must stay focused on the math and the math concludes a difficult task to get our return hurdle going forward. The last time FAST traded at a forward P/E ratio of 34x (the multiple at our exit), the year was 2012. The company had been growing at 20% per year, and the US was about to embark on a shale oil boom, sustaining a low-teens growth trajectory. Today, FAST’s sales growth could turn anemic as the surge for COVID safety products is waning and heavy construction and resources customers are slow to return. An investor must have an optimistic view towards 5+ years of strong real GDP growth as well as sustained inflation. If one lowers the growth assumption to a more likely outcome, then the implicit bet is that low to negative real interest rates will persist and the forward P/E multiple will stay elevated4. I do not want to make such a strong macro bet as the justification for owning a stock. Fastenal is a cyclical business with a growth model proven to take market share secularly, but the time to buy FAST (the stock) will be when we are in the depths of an industrial recession. Stay tuned.”9. Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33  Dividend Yield as of October 13: 2.83%Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

(NYSE:APD), with 498,408 shares worth more than $119.9 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Madison Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“This quarter we are highlighting Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) as a relative yield example in the Materials sector. APD is a leading global industrial gas supply company and is the largest supplier of hydrogen and helium in the world. It has a sustainable competitive advantage due to long-term customer relationships and contracts, high customer switching costs, and the mission critical nature of its products. Industrial gases are a relatively small fraction of customers’ overall costs but are crucial to ensure uninterrupted production.Our thesis on APD is that it appears well-positioned for consistent double-digit growth due to a large multi-year capital allocation plan, and the need for accelerating capital expenditures by its customers. It has a $25 billion backlog driven by traditional gas investments along with new growth opportunities like gasification, green hydrogen, and carbon capture. APD’s gasification technologies help improve energy efficiency and independence, which is a key focus for its customers.

While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Republic Services (NYSE:RSG), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Republic Services with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. Check out our latest analysis for Republic Services How Fast Is Republic Services Growing?If you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Over the last three years, Republic Services has grown EPS by 11% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. While we note Republic Services achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 16% to US$12b. That's a real positive.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Republic Services' future EPS 100% free.Are Republic Services Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$41b company like Republic Services. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Indeed, they hold US$47m worth of its stock. This considerable investment should help drive long-term value in the business. Despite being just 0.1% of the company, the value of that investment is enough to show insiders have plenty riding on the venture.Story continuesIt's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Our quick analysis into CEO remuneration would seem to indicate they are. The median total compensation for CEOs of companies similar in size to Republic Services, with market caps over US$8.0b, is around US$13m.Republic Services offered total compensation worth US$7.9m to its CEO in the year to December 2021. That seems pretty reasonable, especially given it's below the median for similar sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. It can also be a sign of good governance, more generally.Is Republic Services Worth Keeping An Eye On?As previously touched on, Republic Services is a growing business, which is encouraging. The fact that EPS is growing is a genuine positive for Republic Services, but the pleasant picture gets better than that. With company insiders aligning themselves considerably with the company's success and modest CEO compensation, there's no arguments that this is a stock worth looking into. Before you take the next step you should know about the 2 warning signs for Republic Services that we have uncovered.There's always the possibility of doing well buying stocks that are not growing earnings and do not have insiders buying shares. But for those who consider these important metrics, we encourage you to check out companies that do have those features.

They are also urging the return of tens of millions of dollars of deposits to the airline and credit payments to the manufacturer.CONFIDENTIALITY ROWIn a counter-claim in February, Airbus asked Qatar Airways for $220 million in damages and detailed another $185 million of credits against future deliveries which it said had been paid in advance into three funds for the development of Qatar's aviation sector as part of the original A350 deal in 2007-2009.Story continuesAirbus said in a summary of arguments ahead of Friday's hearing that it was seeking reimbursement and had sought details from the airline on how the money had been spent.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $84.5 million, the contract is scheduled to be completed by October 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will offer CFM56-7B27A/3 and CFM56-7B27AE engine depot-level maintenance and repair for P-8A Poseidon jets.The contract will serve the U.S. Navy, the government of Australia and foreign military sales customers. The majority of the work related to this deal will be executed in Atlanta, GA.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, being one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products.

Dow stocks are stocks listed on the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is a stock market index that includes 30 prominent companies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was created by Charles Dow and Edward Jones in 1896 as a price weighted index to track 30 large companies listed either on the NYSE or NASDAQ. It's considered as a benchmark for blue chips listed in the United States. Due to the Federal Reserve having raised interest rates 5 times this year and expectations that the central bank could increase rates even further, the Dow has dropped almost 20% and there could be more downside in the future if economic data fails to meet expectations. Given that it is comprised mainly of blue chips, the Dow has fallen less year to date than the S&amp;P 500 or the NASDAQ indexes, which have fallen around 25% and 34% respectively. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to have a well diversified portfolio across many different stocks across many different sectors. Among the blue chip stocks, here are 11 of the best we think long term investors could potentially consider adding to their portfolios.

Despite the S&amp;P 500 falling around 25% year to date and the Dow falling almost 20%, Honeywell International Inc.

As of October 12, the company trades at a forward P/E ratio of 18.12 and has an average target price of $204.04 per share.

Meridian Funds also said the following about The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in its second quarter investor letter,We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favor The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.9.

The fuel load process marks a historic and pivotal milestone toward startup and commercial operation of the first new nuclear units to be built in the U.S. in more than three decades.""The Vogtle 3 &amp; 4 nuclear units represent a critical, long-term investment in our state's energy future, and the milestone of loading fuel for Unit 3 demonstrates the steady and evident progress at the nuclear expansion site,"" said Chris Womack, chairman, president and CEO of Georgia Power.

These units are important to building the future of energy and will serve as clean, emission-free sources of energy for Georgians for the next 60 to 80 years.""The start of Unit 3 fuel load comes after Southern Nuclear received a historic 103(g) finding from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in August which signified that the new unit has been constructed and will be operated in conformance with the Combined License and NRC regulations.During fuel load, nuclear technicians and operators from Westinghouse and Southern Nuclear are scheduled to safely transfer 157 fuel assemblies one-by-one from the Unit 3 spent fuel pool to the Unit 3 reactor core in the coming days.Startup testing will begin next and is designed to demonstrate the integrated operation of the primary coolant system and steam supply system at design temperature and pressure with fuel inside the reactor. Operators will also bring the plant from cold shutdown to initial criticality, synchronize the unit to the electric grid and systematically raise power to 100%. Vogtle Unit 3 is projected to enter service in the first quarter of 2023.Story continuesSouthern Nuclear will operate the new unit on behalf of the co-owners: Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities.The new Vogtle units are an essential part of Georgia Power's commitment to delivering clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy to its 2.7 million customers.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Southern's (NYSE:SO) returns on capital, so let's have a look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Southern:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.041 = US$4.9b ÷ (US$131b - US$11b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).Thus, Southern has an ROCE of 4.1%.  Even though it's in line with the industry average of 4.4%, it's still a low return by itself. View our latest analysis for Southern roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Southern compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEEven though ROCE is still low in absolute terms, it's good to see it's heading in the right direction. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 4.1%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 24%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Southern thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.Our Take On Southern's ROCEAll in all, it's terrific to see that Southern is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 50% return over the last five years. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing Southern, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

193,9b5f55c7-0e59-46ba-b28b-c0a073d0111f,CI,2022-10-14,New AMA report calls for state regulation of drug price middlemen,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/new-ama-report-calls-for-state-regulation-of-drug-price-middlemen-125000492.html,1665665400,STORY,"['UNH', 'CI', 'CVS']","[The American Medical Association (AMA) released a new report Thursday that puts pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) back in focus as a key player in high drug costs.The role of PBMs in the health care ecosystem has been a hotly debated topic in recent years, as the so-called ""middle managers"" of prescriptions — between insurers and pharmaceutical companies — have integrated with major insurers.The blurring of the lines adds to an opaque process of drug rebates and impacts the final cost of drugs that patients pay.The AMA argues that over time, PBMs have morphed and are now acting like insurance companies — which are regulated at the state level.""PBMs were created in the 1960s to help health insurers contain drug spending. PBMs can stimulate price competition among drug manufacturers by shifting demand among competing substitute drugs. In turn, manufacturers offer rebates to PBMs for their drugs to be placed favorably in a drug formulary, which PBMs are then supposed to pass on to insurers or employers,"" according to AMA's report.AMA President Dr. Jack Resneck, Jr., told Yahoo Finance that these entities are ""now really, fully, administering drug benefit plans. Whether it's creating formularies or making coverage decisions or doing utilization management or creating the pharmacy networks or negotiating reductions and dispensing fees.""Woman pharmacist wearing surgical face mask checking out customer's medication prescription. African female chemist standing behind the counter with a screen partition and using computer in medical store.And with so few players in the market — of which some are exclusive to one major health insurer —competition is slim.Drug companies have complained that they raise list prices because of the increased rebates paid to PBMs — an issue the FTC has begun to address — and are themselves facing scrutiny over the pricing.While the Inflation Reduction Act sought to curb high prices largely impacting Medicare, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has said in calculating penalties for price increases it will consider the commercial market price hikes.Story continuesMeanwhile, the AMA, and groups like it, have been lobbying for more oversight and curbing of the power of PBMs. It is part of a blame game the industry has been engaged in over who is responsible for the high cost of America's health care.""There's no single source of escalation (in cost) of health care, or we would have solved this a long time ago. But this is...where we've seen a lot of dramatic change in the last decade. This is an area where cost has just increasingly been a barrier for our patients,"" Resneck said.""As physicians, we expect new discoveries and new medications that have a lot of R&amp;D to be somewhat expensive when they first come out. But the reality of what we're seeing for our patients is that even those targeted drugs and biologics, 10 years after they come out, they seem to be doubling and tripling and quadrupling in price"" and the generic marketplace isn't working as it should with offering lower costs, Resneck added.Which is why AMA is turning to state governments, and the role they play in regulating insurers, to address the issue.The report highlights the various markets that PBMS operate in, and how much of the market is served by each PBM. It is limited in scope in that it is based on the commercial insurance market and does not include employer-sponsored programs — which could work with the same or a different PBM than the one owned or affiliated with the insurance company used.AMA's report shows that the four largest PBMs have 66% of the national market, and all 10 major PBMs have 97% of the market.The biggest ones are Express Scripts, owned by Cigna (CI), OptumRx, owned by United Health Group (UNH), Kaiser Pharmacy, owned by Kaiser Permanente, IngenioRx which serves Anthem's markets as well as some CVS (CVS) markets, and Caremark, owned by CVS.The report covers states and Census metro areas and identifies the top two PBMs in each market for the services they provide, including price negotiations, retail pharmacy networks, and claims adjudication.Densely-populated areas, like New York City and Boston, tend to have lower concentrations of a single PBM. But less populated areas like Gadsden, Ala,. have 90% penetration from a single PBM — Blue Cross Blue Shield Association's Prime Therapeutics.Those areas are especially concerning for AMA, because of the impact on patients. And as pressure for transparency increases in health care, PBMs remain opaque by comparison, and without specific oversight.Some states have begun to create laws and regulations to control some services, but there is still more work that needs to be done to rein in costs, Resneck said.""There's just a lot of things that can happen if this space gets non-competitive,"" he said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"
194,5cf5f456-61f5-3d64-8ef8-d7ccb9228ea7,TEL,2022-10-14,An Intrinsic Calculation For TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE:TEL) Suggests It's 30% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-te-connectivity-ltd-193427784.html,1665689667,STORY,['TEL'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of TE Connectivity Ltd. (NYSE:TEL) as an investment opportunity by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for TE Connectivity The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.26bUS$2.72bUS$2.77bUS$2.81bUS$2.86bUS$2.92bUS$2.97bUS$3.03bUS$3.09bUS$3.15bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 1.65%Est @ 1.75%Est @ 1.82%Est @ 1.87%Est @ 1.9%Est @ 1.92%Est @ 1.94% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$2.1kUS$2.4kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0kUS$1.9kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$20bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$3.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.0%) = US$61bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$61b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$30bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$50b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$108, the company appears quite undervalued at a 30% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at TE Connectivity as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.129. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For TE Connectivity, there are three relevant elements you should assess:Risks: Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Clough Capital Partners' strategy and Charles Clough's background and go directly to the Top 5 Stock Picks of Charles Clough's Clough Capital Partners.Charles Clough is the chairman and co-chief investment officer at Clough Capital Partners. He graduated from Boston College with a major in History and a minor in Economics and subsequently earned his MBA from the University of Chicago. He then went on to pursue the CFA charter and has been a charter holder since 1979.

Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX) is the biggest holding of Clough. Some of its other top picks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), and Cheniere Energy, Inc. (NYSE:LNG).Charles Clough of Clough Capital PartnersOur MethodologyWe picked top 10 stocks from Clough Capital Partners' portfolio as of its Q2 2022 filing.Top 10 Stock Picks of Charles Clough's Clough Capital Partners10. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Clough Capital Partners Stake: $24,948,000  Percentage of Clough Capital Partners' Portfolio: 3.09%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 153Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a holding company having Google as its completely owned subsidiary. Clough Capital Partners added on its investment in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), as it increased its stake in the company by 86% during Q2 2022. The total investment value of the fund in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) amounts to approximately $25 million as of its last reported filing for the second quarter.Story continuesAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) did not have a particularly good Q2 2022, as the company reported revenue of $69.69 billion for the quarter, up 12.6% YoY but missing the market estimate by $110 million. Similarly, the normalized EPS of $1.21 for the quarter missed the market estimate by $0.06.­On October 4, 2022, Justin Post, an analyst at Bank of America, reduced his price target on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) from $114 to $125. The analyst believes that although the company's cost-cutting measures will likely support earnings in 2023, the global economic turndown will likely impact the profitability of the company as advertising budgets decline.In addition to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Clough Capital Partners had investments in Starwood Property Trust, Inc. (NYSE:STWD), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX).Here is what Lakehouse Capital had to say about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported another strong quarterly result despite the tough macroeconomic conditions. Revenue increased by 13% as Search proved resilient, primarily led by strength in the travel and retail verticals. YouTube advertising growth was lighter and moderated due to a tough comparison period and a general softening in brand advertising spend. That said, YouTube's user engagement and time spent still continues to grow which bodes well for future monetisation opportunities. Google Cloud outpaced the company's overall growth with revenue increasing by 36% and while it has yet to show any signs of profitability, we remain supportive of Alphabet continuing to reinvest in its cloud business given the size of the market opportunity ahead. On the cost front, the company added another 10,000 employees during the quarter, but notably, the CFO mentioned that hiring will likely slow down over the next twelve months as the company focuses on greater operating efficiency. Overall, we're pleased with how the company has performed and are confident that management will be able to control costs, if or when the economic environment becomes more challenging.9.

Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)Clough Capital Partners Stake: $32,698,000  Percentage of Clough Capital Partners' Portfolio: 4.05%Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 45Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) is a defense contractor manufacturing products related to aeronautics and defense mission systems. Clough Capital Partners continued to add to its investment in Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) during Q2 2022 as the fund increased its holding of the company's shares by 46%.On October 4, 2022, Matthew Akers, an analyst at Wells Fargo, increased his target price to $516 while keeping an Equal Weight rating on the company's shares. The analyst believes that the defense stocks can provide a good return given the current geopolitical tensions and higher military spending across the globe.Here is what LRT Capital Management had to say about Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) in its second-quarter 2022 investor letter:Based in Virginia, Northrop Grumman is one of the world's largest defense contractors with annual revenue of more than $30 billion. The company operates in a cozy oligopoly, that after decades of consolidation, the U.S. defense market is now controlled by five large companies: The Boeing Company, General Dynamics Corporation, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Northrop Grumman Corporation, and Raytheon Technologies Corporation.Industry barriers to entry are immense, government procurement cycles are extremely long, and the consolidated industry structure reflects this. This industry structure has allowed Northrop to earn stable mid-teens returns on invested capital (ROIC) and grow earnings per share at a rate of over 13% per year in the past decade, despite a topline that has grown only in-line with inflation. Even after the recent run-up in the stock price, it trades at approximately 15x, next year's earnings estimates, far below the S&amp;P 500 index, despite being an above average company. While nominally, there are five major defense contractors, the true industry concentration is even higher because not all companies compete in all possible business segments. General Dynamics' division submarine division, Electric Boat, is the sole supplier of nuclear power submarines in the United States. Lockheed Martin is the sole supplier of the F-35 and F-22. Northrop was the sole bidder on the contract to develop the next generation of intercontinental ballistic missiles, and so on.The company's revenue growth over the past decade has been mediocre, but even that has led to impressive shareholder returns that have far outpaced the S&amp;P500. What's more, we believe that revenue growth may accelerate in the next few years. A lot of ink spilled every year about the ""massive"" U.S. defense budget7 that critics claim is ""out of control"" 8. Given this, you might be surprised to hear that U.S. defense spending as a share of GDP is at the lowest level in recorded history,9 at a mere 3.8%. In other words, U.S. military spending could double and not be out of line with historical norms. While we are not calling for a new Cold War, given the global instability we are witnessing, it is not unreasonable to expect defense spending to grow faster than GDP over the next decade. Click to continue reading and see the Top 5 Stock Picks of Charles Clough's Clough Capital Partners.Suggested Articles:11 Best American Dividend Stocks to Buy NowBest Hemp Stocks to Buy NowBest Cryptocurrency Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsDisclosure: None. Top 10 Stock Picks of Charles Clough's Clough Capital Partners is originally published on Insider Monkey. ]"
199,ef22b0eb-f73f-3e77-ba89-44b0a9175dbb,NOC,2022-10-14,Boeing (BA) Clinches $85M Deal to Support P-8A Aircraft,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boeing-ba-clinches-85m-deal-152603946.html,1665674763,STORY,"['BA', 'NOC', 'LMT', 'TXT']","[The Boeing Company BA recently secured a modification contract involving P-8A Poseidon aircraft. The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $84.5 million, the contract is scheduled to be completed by October 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will offer CFM56-7B27A/3 and CFM56-7B27AE engine depot-level maintenance and repair for P-8A Poseidon jets.The contract will serve the U.S. Navy, the government of Australia and foreign military sales customers. The majority of the work related to this deal will be executed in Atlanta, GA.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, being one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.9%.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Its major programs include F-35, C-130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor jets.Lockheed Martin boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 5.4%. The stock boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 64.46%.Textron’s business unit, Textron Aviation Defense, designs, builds and supports versatile and globally-known military aircraft, preferred for training and attack missions. Some of Textron’s renowned products include Beechcraft T-6C trainer and AT-6 Wolverine.Textron boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 12.5%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TXT’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 5.7% from the 2021 reported figure.Price MovementShares of Boeing have lost 41.2% in the past 12 months compared with the industry’s decline of 20.3%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankBoeing currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:NKE)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-nike-inc-110059485.html,1665745259,STORY,['NKE'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for NIKE Is NIKE Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.66bUS$5.76bUS$6.81bUS$7.45bUS$8.50bUS$9.27bUS$9.91bUS$10.5bUS$10.9bUS$11.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 9.07%Est @ 6.94%Est @ 5.45%Est @ 4.41%Est @ 3.68% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1% US$4.4kUS$5.0kUS$5.5kUS$5.7kUS$6.0kUS$6.1kUS$6.1kUS$6.0kUS$5.9kUS$5.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$56bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$11b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.0%) = US$225bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$225b÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$113bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$170b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$89.6, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NIKE as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.097. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

The vaccine would be used as a single booster dose in children as young as five years. These boosters can be given at least two months following primary or booster vaccination.Following the FDA decision, a 10-µg dose of Pfizer/BioNTech’s bivalent vaccine is now authorized for use in individuals aged between five and 11 years. A 25-µg and 50-µg dose of Moderna’s bivalent vaccine is authorized for children aged six to 11 years and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, respectively.The bivalent vaccines contain an mRNA encoding the spike protein present in the original vaccine and an mRNA encoding the spike protein common in the Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 variants.The FDA authorized Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s BA.4/BA.5 boosters for people 12 and older for Pfizer and 18 and older for Moderna in late August.Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna’s filings seeking authorization of the bivalent vaccines were based on clinical studies on their bivalent Omicron BA.1-adapted vaccines as well as pre-clinical data from studies on their Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccines.Unlike all previously-approved COVID-19 vaccines, the authorization granted to these booster shots is not supported by data from any human clinical studies demonstrating the vaccine’s effectiveness.Currently, the BA.4 and BA.5 account for more than 80% of COVID-19 infections in The United States. It is expected that these subvariants will lead to increased infection rates later this year during the winter season. To curb the infection rates and motivate people to resume their pre-pandemic activities, the FDA authorized the use of bivalent vaccines in young children to prevent severe consequences like hospitalization and death.Story continuesThe approved/authorized monovalent COVID-19 vaccines were not very effective against the BA.4/BA.5 subvariants. Though administering a primary vaccination regimen has helped reduce serious outcomes caused by COVID-19 variants, clinical studies have shown the antibody levels to wane over time. While authorized booster doses have restored these antibodies to their previous levels, this protection also weakens over time. As a result, there is a huge need for booster doses, which provide protection against the new emerging variants and thereby prevent serious outcomes caused by the disease.Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech also intend to seek FDA’s authorization to use their vaccines in children aged six months and older. Moderna plans to file a EUA application for children aged between six months and five years by this year’s end.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more inflation stocks, go directly to 5 Best Inflation Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Inflationary pressures in the past few months have forced the Federal Reserve in the United States to raise rates five times this year. The total increase comes to about 3 percentage points, a figure expected to rise by 0.75 percentage points when the central bank meets again in three weeks. Inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics continues to paint a bleak picture for the economy. Per latest numbers, the producer price index, a measure of prices that US businesses get for the goods and services they produce, increased 0.4% in September. The increase excluded food, energy, and trade services and represented a 5.6% rise from a year ago. Food prices led to an increase in goods inflation, with a 1.2% monthly hike. Energy rose 0.7% after posting massive gains the previous two months. US President Joe Biden has played down risks of a recession in the US in the wake of these figures, telling CNN recently that he did not think the US would sink into a recession, but even if it did, he expected it to be a very slight one, remarking that finance experts predicted a recession every six months. Investors who are anticipating a recession in the US economy have loaded up on some of the best inflation stocks like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), and The Proctor and Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) as the benchmark indexes continue to register declines. Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, recently told reporters that “the worst is yet to come, and for many people, 2023 will feel like a recession”. Our MethodologyThese companies that have shown historical resilience against an inflationary environment were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. A database of around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe. Story continues10 Best Inflation Stocks to Buy According to Hedge FundsPhoto by Kaleidico on UnsplashBest Inflation Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds10.

It is one of the top inflation stocks to invest in. Recent reports indicate that the company is planning to eliminate jobs in the safety and industrial division.

(NYSE:PM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 56     Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM) is a company that makes and sells cigarettes in more than 180 countries across the world.

The company received an all-cash takeover offer from rival Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), which we also held in the portfolio, for SEK 106 per share—a 35% premium to Swedish Match’s prior closing share price. The deal is a good fit for PM as it reduces PM’s dependence on cigarettes—a category in steady decline—and accelerates the company’s transition to smokeless “reduced-risk” products (RRPs)—a category that has experienced rapid growth over the past five years. PM can also leverage its global scale to generate significant revenue synergies from these complementary product sets, as well as quickly gain access to the US market—the world’s largest market for RRPs and one where regulators have embraced RRPs and other less harmful nicotine products. We exited our position in Swedish Match as shares approached the takeout price.”7.

222,6ec73fca-38fa-3679-992d-7e1f5cb03327,PFE,2022-10-14,3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks: A Smarter Way to Boost Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ranked-dividend-stocks-131001488.html,1665666601,STORY,['PFE'],"[Here's a revealing data point: older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future.That means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.Today's retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields - and the Social Security picture isn't too rosy either. Right now and for the near future, Social Security benefits are still being paid, but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035.So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesA rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Conagra Brands (CAG) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.33 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.93%. This compares to the Food - Miscellaneous industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.81%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 5.6%. Check Conagra Brands (CAG) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Pfizer (PFE) is paying out a dividend of $0.4 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.81% compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.82% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 2.56% over the past year. Check Pfizer (PFE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $1.5 per share, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) has a dividend yield of 4.11%. This is compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.97% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 20%. Check The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?The fact is that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds. To counterbalance this, invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly, can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LinePursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.PayPal Holdings hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on PayPal Holdings.Is There Enough Growth For PayPal Holdings?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as PayPal Holdings' is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 58% decrease to the company's bottom line. As a result, earnings from three years ago have also fallen 17% overall. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 34% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.6% each year growth forecast for the broader market.With this information, we can see why PayPal Holdings is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.The Bottom Line On PayPal Holdings' P/EGenerally, our preference is to limit the use of the price-to-earnings ratio to establishing what the market thinks about the overall health of a company.Story continuesWe've established that PayPal Holdings maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.It is also worth noting that we have found 3 warning signs for PayPal Holdings that you need to take into consideration.You might be able to find a better investment than PayPal Holdings.

It does not require any second device to pair with and features robust Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity.Terminal enables merchants to accept payments from customers via credit cards, digital wallets,PayPal and Venmo QR Codes, seamlessly and securely.It also helps businesses in sales, inventory, reporting and payments management.We believe that all these features will aid the company in gaining solid momentum among small businesses, which, in turn, will strengthen its seller base.The latest move is likely to boost the total number of payment transactions and total payment volume (TPV) in the days ahead.In second-quarter 2022, PayPal’s total number of payment transactions was 5.5 billion, up 16% on a year-over-year basis. TPV amounted to $339.8 billion, reflecting year-over-year growth of 9% on a spot rate basis and 13% on a currency-neutral basis.PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price and Consensus PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price and ConsensusPayPal Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-chart | PayPal Holdings, Inc. QuoteGrowing Focus on Small BusinessesWe note that the latest move bodes well for PayPal’s growing efforts toward strengthening offerings for small businesses.Apart from the latest move, the company recently launched PayPal Business Cashback Mastercard, its business credit card backed by Mastercard and issued by WebBank, with the help of which it strives to cater to the daily financing needs of small businesses.Expanding the global reach of PayPal Business Debit Mastercard remains noteworthy. Notably, the card, which is ideal for small businesses, does not carry any monthly fees or foreign exchange fees. The card allows users to access the funds stored in their PayPal accounts at more than 52 million Mastercard acceptance locations throughout the world.The company offers PayPal Working Capital and PayPal Business Loans, which are focused on catering to the needs of small businesses.We believe that all these endeavors will boost the small merchant base of PayPal, which, in turn, will drive its top-line growth in the days ahead.Story continuesGrowing Digital Payment InitiativesThe latest move is in sync with the company’s strengthening digital payment endeavors.In addition to the latest launch, PayPal’s unveiling of a payment card, namely the PayPal Cashback credit card issued by Synchrony, remains a positive. The card allows customers to gain more rewards while shopping online and offline, and paying with PayPal.The card offers a 3% cash back when paying with PayPal at checkout — online, mobile, or in-store with PayPal QR Code. It gives an unlimited 2% cash back on all other purchases made through Mastercard, wherever accepted.PayPal’s partnership with United, under which PayPal QR Code was made available as a payment option for passengers on boarding flights of the latter, remains noteworthy.We believe that all the above-mentioned efforts will continue to expand PayPal’s footprint in the booming digital payment world.Per a report from Statista, this market is expected to generate a transaction value of $8.7 trillion in 2022, which is expected to see a CAGR of 12.8% between 2022 and 2026, and hit $14.1 trillion by 2026.We believe that the company’s growing prospects in this promising market will help it win investor confidence in the near term.Notably, PayPal has lost 55.5% on a year-to-date basis compared with the industry’s decline of 57.5%.Zacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderCurrently, PayPal carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the broader Zacks Computer &amp; Technology sector can consider some better-ranked stocks like Arista Networks ANET, Agilent Technologies A and Aspen Technology AZPN.

MPC sports the highest-possible ‘A’ rating in each of our Zacks Value, Growth, and Momentum Style Score categories, indicating an increased likelihood that the stock continues to propel higher. The powerful combination of relative undervaluation and positive earnings estimate revisions should serve bullish MPC investors well into the future.Marathon Petroleum is a component of the Zacks Oil &amp; Gas – Refining and Marketing industry, which currently ranks in the top 1% out of approximately 250 industry groups. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform the market over the next 3 to 6 months. Also note the favorable characteristics for this group below:Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuantitative research studies suggest that approximately half of a stock’s future price appreciation is due to its industry grouping. By targeting stocks contained within leading industry groups, we can dramatically improve our odds of success.Company DescriptionMarathon Petroleum, headquartered in Findlay, Ohio, is engaged in refining, transporting and marketing of petroleum products. MPC also manufactures aromatics, propane, propylene, and sulfur. The company sells refined products to wholesale marketing customers in the United States and internationally.MPC stores and distributes crude oil through pipelines, terminals, and barges. Furthermore, it gathers and transports natural gas liquids. Operating in 37 states, the District of Columbia, and Mexico, the energy giant was founded in 1887.Recent Earnings and Future Estimates MPC has been on a hot streak in terms of earnings surprises, beating estimates in each of the past four quarters – with an average beat of 56.68%. Back in August, the company reported Q2 EPS of $10.61/share, a +15.7% surprise over the $9.17 consensus estimate. When a company is consistently exceeding estimates by this wide of a margin, it typically creates a ‘tailwind’ and boosts price momentum.Story continuesRevenues for the second quarter of $54.2 billion also topped estimates by 63.08%. MPC has surpassed revenue estimates in each of the last four quarters.In the past 60 days, analysts have raised their Q3 EPS projections by +9.02%. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate now stands at $6.89 per share, reflecting astounding growth of 843.84% relative to the same quarter last year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCharting the CourseMPC is up nearly 75% this year alone, widely outperforming the major indices. Only stocks that are in extremely powerful uptrends are able to weather bear markets and corrections so gracefully. This is the kind of stock we want to include in our portfolio – one that is trending well and receiving positive earnings estimate revisions.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. And as we know, MPC has seen a recent batch of positive revisions. As long as this trend remains intact (and MPC continues to post earnings beats), the stock should continue its bullish run into next year.Other Factors to ConsiderMarathon Petroleum remains focused on enhancing shareholder value. The company currently pays a $2.23 (2.2%) dividend.In addition, MPC repurchased $4.1 billion worth of shares during Q2 and has now completed more than 80% of its target to buy back $15 billion in common stock.Bottom LineAs an established veteran in the industry, MPC trends remain favorable amid strength in the energy sector. Buoyed by an undervalued and leading industry group along with a maximum overall Zacks VGM score of ‘A’, it’s not difficult to see why MPC is a compelling investment.A history of large earnings surprises along with a strong technical trend certainly warrant a closer look at this top-rated stock. Recent positive earnings estimate revisions should also serve to create a ‘floor’ in terms of any sudden or unexpected downside moves. If you’re looking for a way to diversify your portfolio, make sure to put MPC on your shortlist.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

232,b1e31ae3-6fda-3b76-a5a0-4b5ed01d7820,MPC,2022-10-14,Marathon Petroleum (MPC) Is Up 7.56% in One Week: What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/marathon-petroleum-mpc-7-56-160004607.html,1665676804,STORY,['MPC'],"[Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock's recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Marathon Petroleum (MPC), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Marathon Petroleum currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?In order to see if MPC is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this refiner holds up.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor MPC, shares are up 7.56% over the past week while the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry is up 7.73% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 6.75% compares favorably with the industry's 0.09% performance as well.While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Marathon Petroleum have increased 18.21% over the past quarter, and have gained 60.83% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved -5.98% and -16.33%, respectively.Investors should also take note of MPC's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, MPC is averaging 4,969,423 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with MPC.Over the past two months, 5 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost MPC's consensus estimate, increasing from $20.72 to $22.47 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 5 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that MPC is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Marathon Petroleum on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

233,3e19a972-661f-3c17-aaf0-16659131376e,MPC,2022-10-14,Investing in Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) five years ago would have delivered you a 123% gain,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-marathon-petroleum-nyse-mpc-134621047.html,1665668781,STORY,['MPC'],"[When we invest, we're generally looking for stocks that outperform the market average. Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) share price is up 85% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market decline of around 39% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 65% , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. See our latest analysis for Marathon Petroleum To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During the last half decade, Marathon Petroleum became profitable. That's generally thought to be a genuine positive, so we would expect to see an increasing share price.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how Marathon Petroleum has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on Marathon Petroleum's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Marathon Petroleum the TSR over the last 5 years was 123%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Marathon Petroleum shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 65% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 17%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Marathon Petroleum better, we need to consider many other factors.

234,d6f62f38-5a9a-341f-b16a-4a3c990c040f,MPC,2022-10-14,Bet on 3 Dividend Stocks to Combat Energy Market Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bet-3-dividend-stocks-combat-130801619.html,1665666481,STORY,"['VLO', 'MPC', 'PSX']","[Notorious volatility is an integral part of the energy sector, as reflected in the wild swings in oil prices since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. However, due to some key factors, dividend-paying stocks in the same space are relatively less volatile, thereby making Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC, Valero Energy Corporation VLO and Phillips 66 PSX well-poised to gain.Extremely Volatile Energy MarketWe should not forget how oil prices have behaved since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020.However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which in turn led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Dividend Stocks to the RescueOverall oil pricing scenario seems scary, which could easily deter an investor from allocating money to energy companies. Despite this volatility constraint, investors could consider dividend-paying companies belonging to the industry. This is because, generally, companies with stable dividend-paying history are usually relatively less volatile than stocks with no dividend history. It is expected that companies that have been rewarding stockholders with dividends will try their best to continue paying at the same pace or higher, making the stocks attractive and less volatile to the vagaries of the market.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three such stocks. Two of the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while one carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). With a dividend yield of more than 2%, all the companies have raised dividends over the past five years. Moreover, with a payout ratio of less than 60%, the companies ensure sustainability with enough scope for future dividend increases.Story continues3 Stocks in the SpotlightMarathon Petroleum Corporation: As a leading, integrated, downstream energy player, Marathon Petroleum is the operator of the largest refining system in the nation. Handsome margins and throughput in all regions are aiding MPC. #1 Ranked Marathon Petroleum pays out a quarterly dividend of 58 cents ($2.32 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.21% yield at the current stock price.

For GM CEO Mary Barra, the suite of products creates an ecosystem that not only helps customers but also America’s electrical grid.“One of the things we want people to understand is not only is an electric vehicle your mode of transportation, how you get from point A to point B, but it can also be a power source,” Barra said in an interview with Yahoo Finance Editor-in-Chief Andy Serwer. “And I think that's gonna be very important as we look and really strengthen the grid in whatever country we're doing work.”“We have the battery technology to provide clean energy, energy storage, and also supplement the grid,” said, whose interview will be featured at Yahoo Finance's All Markets Summit on Oct. 17. “So we're really excited about the business opportunity based on the Ultium technology that we have.”GM Energy will sell battery technology and energy management systems through its newly created Ultium Home and Ultium Commercial suite of products and services, which will integrate with its existing Ultimium Charge 360 charging network. On-site battery storage that Ultium Home and Ultium Commercial provide could allow the customers to create “microgrids” that work off the main electrical grid and provide electricity to utilities during times of heavy load, while offering customers more control over charging.GM Energy home solution with SunPower (credit: GM)In addition, the upcoming Chevrolet Silverado EV pick up will be able to provide bidirectional charging, meaning it can send its own electric power to customers home or business when needed, and charge from the grid or on-site batteries only when it needs to do so.“We see it being a significant growth opportunity for the company,” Barra said. “When you look at it being another reason people buy an electric vehicle, but also what we can do beyond the vehicle from an energy perspective.”Story continuesGM Energy is partnering with SunPower (SPRW), a solar technology and services provider, to develop and offer at-home energy systems that will potentially include at home chargers, solar panels for additional energy capture, and home energy storage.“The grid today doesn't have enough capacity for all the future EV sales that we expect, and General Motors is expecting to sell more than a million electric vehicles in the next three years,” SunPower CEO Peter Faricy told Yahoo Finance about the company’s opportunity with GM. “For practical purposes and obviously to combat climate change, more and more consumers are going to want solar power..

These days, their enmity has turned towards the electric vehicle front as they try to innovate for the future. Recent performance indicates General Motors is outpacing Ford at the moment. However, that doesn't mean the company is free of issues. General Motors has been hit hard by the rising cost of raw materials, which has squeezed margins and forced the company to raise prices on its vehicles. General Motors will need to find a way to address these challenges to remain competitive in the years ahead.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with GM. Click here to check it out. GM 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of GMPeter Lynch Chart of GMThe next year's inflation will weigh down heavily on the company's results. UBS Group (NYSE:UBS) cited this as justification when it downgraded the car giant to ""Neutral"" and slashed its price target to $38 from $56. UBS predicts a recession and warns that General Motors will feel the storm's impact, especially in Europe.General Motors, for its part, is looking good going into earnings season. The automotive company saw a 24% increase in third-quarter sales to 555,580 vehicles as buying was fueled by pent-up demand and the semiconductor supply stabilized. This was a sharp turnaround from the second quarter when General Motors reported a 15% drop in U.S. sales.Undoubtedly, the markets are bearish at the moment, and the situation will not change anytime soon. Under this environment, the near-term outlook for General Motors remains stressed, even if the long-term outlook seems strong.How inflation and rising interest rates are putting pressure on General MotorsGeneral Motors has been on a roll lately, reporting strong sales and profits in the most recent quarter. However, the company is facing some significant headwinds that could threaten its profitability. First, General Motors is still dealing with supply chain disruptions from the global chip shortage. This has caused production delays and component shortages, leading to lost sales and higher costs. Even though the supply has stabilized somewhat, that doesn't eliminate past issues, and new regulations from the U.S. government threaten to plunge the semiconductor supply chain into chaos once again.Story continuesInflationary pressures are further squeezing margins. General Motors is responding by cutting costs and focusing on its most profitable vehicles. Whether this will be enough to overcome the challenges on the horizon is not known at this time. General Motors is a company that has weathered many storms before, but not without heavy losses; such is the nature of a cyclical industry.Finally, U.S. interest rates are rising, increasing the cost of borrowing for General Motors and buyers of its vehicles. The Fed has increased its benchmark rate five times this year. Experts predict the rate will be at 4.4% by the end of the year, and by 2023, the prediction is for it to rise to 4.6%. While General Motors has navigated these challenges so far, they will likely become more daunting in the coming months. As a result, General Motors' profitability may come under pressure in the near term.General Motors' electric vehicle ambitions will keep bulls interestedGeneral Motors plans to sell 30 different models of electric vehicles by 2025. A $35 billion investment strongly indicates the automaker's commitment to investing in electric vehicles. Likely, other automakers will also make major investments in this area, leading to breakthroughs in the sector and high competition. The EV market is still relatively small, but it is growing rapidly as consumers become more aware of the benefits of electric vehicles.General Motors is planning on going all-electric with its vehicles, while Ford shows a more diverse approach with different types of electric vehicles and hybrid models. General Motors offers the Chevrolet Bolt EV and Chevrolet Spark EV, as well as the Cadillac CT6 PHEV. Ford may be more hesitant to embrace EVs, but it does have some great options such as the Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning, E-Transit Van, etc. The contrasting approaches by General Motors and Ford underscore the different strategies automakers are taking as they look to meet consumer demand for more fuel-efficient and environmentally friendly vehicles.General Motors' pure-play approach looks better in the long-run, in my opinion. General Motors is making a big bet on electric vehicles, aiming to put all its eggs in one basket. The company has said it will phase out the production of gas-powered cars by 2035 and will only sell cars with zero tailpipe emissions by then. In contrast, Ford is taking a more cautious approach, saying it will continue producing gas-powered cars alongside electric cars. General Motors' approach looks risky but could pay off in the long run. If the market for electric vehicles grows as General Motors expects, the company will be well-positioned to dominate the market.TakeawayGeneral Motors is an icon in the American automotive industry. The company has been in business for over a century and constantly innovates to remain relevant. However, General Motors is facing many challenges in the near term.First and foremost, automobile demand will likely fall sharply as inflation increases and consumers tighten their budgets. In addition, General Motors is facing a severe supply shortage due to the semiconductor crisis. This has led to production cuts, which is likely to weigh on the company's financial performance in the previous quarters.From a long-term perspective, the investment thesis for General Motors looks strong in my view, especially compared to Ford which is dragging its feet. Those looking for a quick turnaround, though, will be disappointed.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

For more on this, we're joined by Yahoo Finance's editor-in-chief Andy Serwer. Andy, you spoke to Mary Barra just yesterday. What did you take away from that conversation regarding GM Energy?ANDY SERWER: Yeah, that's right, Brad. And the company announced this on Tuesday. And I spoke with Mary Barra yesterday, as you said-- first time she's talked about this new business endeavor, which is sort of a holistic end-to-end way of introducing EVs and related products and services to consumers and businesses. Here's what she had to say about that.MARY BARRA: One of the things we want people to understand is not only is an electric vehicle your mode of transportation, how you get from point A to point B, but it can also be a power source. And I think that's going to be very important as we look and really strengthen the grid in whatever country we're doing work.And in addition, we can leverage the technology we have, the battery technology, to provide clean energy, energy storage, and also supplement the grid. So we're really excited about the business opportunity based on the altium technology that we have.ANDY SERWER: I also asked Barra exactly how big the business opportunity is here, and she declined to be specific about it. But a GM executive also indicated that it was significant and said it was probably in the $200 billion range. You guys, does this remind you of another company a little bit, though, that has a similar sort of vision in terms of its vehicles and how it relates to consumers with tertiary products and services that relate to the electric economy?Story continuesJULIE HYMAN: Yeah, I would say. I mean, I was actually going to bring up Jim Farley. And, like, he has been so fired up about the electric opportunity. And I just wonder sort of, vibe wise, since you were out there, kind of, what it was like, and are you getting that similar kind of energy-- pardon the pun-- from a GM?ANDY SERWER: Yeah, well, I mean, you have to have that energy-- pardon the pun, Julie-- if you're in this business. And they've got a full fleet of EVs more on sort of the drawing board than actually in the marketplace right now. They have a few in the marketplace, a lot more coming in Q1 and Q2 of '23. But when you look at this, it's sort of, really, a vertically integrated take on the electric economy.And, you know, I'm not sure how this is going to pan out for not only GM and Ford, but even Tesla as well. Is it really the case that because people want an EV from a company, that they also want storage packs and batteries that connect to the house and can serve as generators if there are power outages and could possibly even get power back into the grid? I mean, that is a huge question.I mean, I think EVs, yes, we all know they're for real, and they're going to be dominating the business going forward. But as far as this sort of vision where everything is connected, I'm not sure that's really the case. And, you know, it'll be interesting to see whether there really is an ROI to this business for, again, not only GM and Ford, but even Tesla.JULIE HYMAN: Or if there is a case for all of that connection, is it not five years from now, but maybe it's 10 or 20 years from now, right? So I think that's one of the big questions around all of this as well. Andy, thanks so much. Can't wait to see that full interview. Appreciate it.]"

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this company have returned -20.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -12.9% change. The Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, to which General Motors Company belongs, has lost 27.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.91 per share, indicating a change of +25.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.8% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.71 points to a change of -5.1% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -1.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.42 indicates a change of -4.4% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.5%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for General Motors Company.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate of $41.83 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +56.2%. The $154.01 billion and $163.72 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +21.3% and +6.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $35.76 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +4.7%. EPS of $1.14 for the same period compares with $1.97 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.25 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.35%. The EPS surprise was -17.99%.Over the last four quarters, General Motors Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Morgan Stanley MS, UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL and First Horizon Corp. FHN.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Large-Cap Stocks Likely to Beat on Q3 EarningsU.S. stock markets are set for the third-quarter 2022 earnings season commencing this week.  Market participants will keenly watch this earnings season as it will provide the most descriptive view of U.S. corporate health amid record-high inflation and an extremely hawkish Fed.In addition to revenues and the net profit numbers of companies, several metrics of margins, like gross margin, operating margin and net margin will be of immense importance to investors this earnings cycle. Moreover, the outlook of U.S. corporations will guide the next course of Wall Street’s movement.Our estimates for third-quarter earnings of the market’s benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 Index, have shown a gradual decline in the past three and a half months. As of Oct 12, per our estimation for the third quarter as a whole, total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index will rise a mere 0.1% year over year on 9.1% higher revenues.We have identified five large-cap stocks that are set to beat on third-quarter earnings. Investment in these stocks should be fruitful as an earnings beat is expected to drive stock prices going forward. These companies are — Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group Inc., Lockheed Martin Corp., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and First Horizon Corp.Q3 at a GlanceLike the first half, the third quarter of 2022 also remained tough for the U.S. economy. Various measures of inflation remained elevated at a 40-year high. The Fed has hiked the benchmark interest rate by 3% so far in 2022 and it was in the range of 3.25% to 3.5% at the end of the third quarter. Moreover, the central bank has started to reduce the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet systematically since June.Story continuesDespite these aggressive monetary policies adopted by the Fed, inflation is showing no signs of declining. The complete devastation of the global supply-chain system and the shortage of labor continued to put pressure on businesses in the form of higher input costs and wages.The lingering war between Russia and Ukraine and the lockdown in China due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections were the major hindrances to the restoration of the global supply-chain system. Agencies like the IMF, the World Bank and the OECD have warned of a possible global recession in 2023.Stocks in FocusFive large-cap companies will report third-quarter 2022 earnings within the next seven days. Each of these stocks has a positive Earnings ESP and carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Moreover, the outlook of U.S. corporates will guide the next course of Wall Street’s movement.Our estimates for third-quarter earnings of the market’s benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 Index, has shown a gradual decline in the past three and a half months. As of Oct 12, per our estimation for the third quarter as a whole, total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index will rise a mere 0.1% year over year on 9.1% higher revenues.We have identified five large-cap stocks that are set to beat on third-quarter earnings. Investment in these stocks should be fruitful as an earnings beat is expected to drive stock prices going forward. These companies are — Morgan Stanley MS, UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL and First Horizon Corp. FHN.Q3 at a GlanceLike the first half, the third quarter of 2022 also remained tough for the U.S. economy. Various measures of inflation remained elevated at a 40-year high. The Fed has hiked the benchmark interest rate by 3% so far in 2022 and it was in the range of 3.25% to 3.5% at the end of the third quarter. Moreover, the central bank has started to reduce the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet systematically since June.Despite these aggressive monetary policies adopted by the Fed, inflation is showing no signs of declining. The complete devastation of the global supply-chain system and the shortage of labor continued to put pressure on businesses in the form of higher input costs and wages.Story continuesThe lingering war between Russia and Ukraine and the lockdown in China due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections were the major hindrances to the restoration of the global supply-chain system. Agencies like the IMF, the World Bank and the OECD have warned of a possible global recession in 2023.Stocks in FocusFive large-cap companies will report third-quarter 2022 earnings within the next seven days.

It's often heard in relation to sustainability initiatives or socially responsible investing.However, when it comes to ESG, all stakeholders are increasingly looking at these nonfinancial factors in deciding which companies they want to work for or with. And that makes this an area of significant focus for PNC.Lora Phillips, director of ESG for the Corporate Responsibility Group, talks about what ESG looks like at PNC and why it's important along with the work her team is doing.What is your team's role at PNC?Phillips: We look for the intersection of the issues our stakeholders care about with those that are core to PNC's business and those issues that we can make meaningful progress against. For PNC, that includes things you might expect to find in an ESG strategy, like environmental and social risk management or diversity and inclusion, plus things that might surprise you, like customer privacy and employee compensation philosophies.This brings up a very important point about ESG at PNC - it's a collaborative practice. The ESG team works with subject matter experts across the bank to tell their stories in ways that resonate with investors, activists and all kinds of stakeholders who have an interest in how PNC is managing this complicated, interconnected mix of issues in ways that make a difference.In addition to stakeholder engagement on ESG topics, my team also performs environmental and social risk management, manages our voluntary Corporate Responsibility and ESG reporting and is working to develop and execute our ""4+1"" Climate Action strategy.Why is corporate responsibility so important for companies right now?Phillips: I would argue that it's always been important. If you think about defining moments for the American business community, many of them were born out of what stakeholders care about and what's uniquely important for a business to manage well - things like child labor, safe working conditions or the fact that, until 1974, women couldn't get a credit card without a man co-signing. These things were ultimately codified into law but started with activism and engagement. Whether you refer to it as corporate social responsibility, corporate responsibility, sustainability or ESG, the concept has been around for a long time, and it's integral to how businesses operate.Story continuesCan you tell us more about PNC's climate strategy?Phillips: PNC's ""4+1"" Climate Action Strategy is about setting concrete goals as we finance the transition to a low-carbon economy. To do this, we engage with working groups, coalitions and partnerships that focus on the climate and environment to ensure we are providing the financing and advice our clients need to create and execute their own climate transition plans.We also put recommendations into practice for our own operations and workplace by setting and achieving ambitious carbon emissions, energy use, water use and renewable electricity goals.For our employees, we're in the process of building out a Climate Transition Advocates program, based on the very successful PNC Women's Business Advocate model that was further adopted by our Minority Business Development team. The goal is to introduce a baseline level of climate-change knowledge for any employee across the bank who's interested, but we think there's going to be particular interest from many client-facing teams.We hear from PNC's Sustainable Finance team that clients are increasingly interested in discussing ESG issues - not just environmental but social issues, too. We'd like to get to a place where we have a large number of employees who are able to credibly have those conversations with clients.How does PNC address the ""S"" - or social - part of ESG?Phillips: PNC aligns its work with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 1 most relevant to our industry and business model. The bank's $88 billion Community Benefits Plan and Project 257 initiative are just two examples of how we are able to make a social impact.The Community Benefits Plan gives us the opportunity over a four-year period to provide loans, investments and other financial support to bolster economic opportunity for low- and moderate-income individuals and communities, people and communities of color along with other underserved communities. Project 257 focuses on making a positive impact by leveraging our resources to accelerate women's financial equality.We're constantly scanning the ESG landscape to understand what issues are important to our stakeholders. We do this in many different ways, including conversations with our investors and advocacy groups focused on a variety of issues, from climate change to diversity and inclusion to financial inclusion, and many other topics.PNC assigns specific ESG oversight to each Board of Directors committee. Why is this important?Phillips: PNC's Board of Directors has had collective responsibility for ESG risks and opportunities for a long time, but last year we assigned specific ESG oversight to each committee and that gives them the opportunity to take a deeper dive into specific issues. This helps to inform the broader conversation with the full board and introduces more organic opportunities to raise questions about how ESG and corporate responsibility issues are woven into our overall corporate strategy.How does PNC decide on ESG goals and track its progress?Phillips: We're constantly scanning the ESG landscape to understand what issues are important to our stakeholders. We do this in many different ways, including conversations with our investors and advocacy groups focused on a variety of issues, from climate change to diversity and inclusion to financial inclusion, and many other topics. We also do a formal ESG materiality analysis every two years that includes collecting information from all of our stakeholders to determine what they want to see from us and what we're positioned to accomplish. Those issues are a good indicator of where we should be setting firm targets or goals. We work with lines of business across PNC to explore what those goals could look like, and they ultimately go to our ESG Executive Steering Group as they make decisions.What is the role of the ESG Executive Steering Group?Phillips: The Steering Group is made up of executive committee members whose work most directly touches the issues we actively manage, along with our disclosures and reporting on those issues.Officially, this group sets ESG strategy, approves ESG goals and commitments, decides ESG partnerships and approves ESG reports and disclosures. But I think of them as our ""ESG lighthouse."" ESG issues can be incredibly complicated, and often decisions have lots of ripple effects throughout the organization. These leaders help us chart a path forward and ensure we're making the right decisions for PNC and our stakeholders.Why is this work important to you?Phillips: I started my academic career in electrical engineering, then took a different path that led to working in a large, global Silicon Valley tech firm. In both my academic and early career experiences, situations came up that made me reflect on how I wanted to develop my career and see my contribution to the world. It's important to me that my work allows a connection to a strong sense of purpose and that, collectively, we as an organization leave things a little better than we found them. This work forces us to think about the ripple effects of our actions out in the world. There's a Brene Brown quote that has always stuck with me: ""I'm not here to be right; I'm here to get it right."" And I've tried to make that my North Star.PNC Financial Services Group, Thursday, October 13, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from PNC Financial Services Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: PNC Financial Services GroupWebsite: https://www.pnc.com/en/personal-banking.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: PNC Financial Services GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/720357/Understanding-ESG-at-PNC]"
257,6ec73fca-38fa-3679-992d-7e1f5cb03327,PNC,2022-10-14,3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks: A Smarter Way to Boost Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ranked-dividend-stocks-131001488.html,1665666601,STORY,['PFE'],"[Here's a revealing data point: older Americans are scared more of outliving wealth than of death itself.Also, retirees who have constructed a nest egg have valid justifications to be concerned, since the traditional ways to plan for retirement may mean income can no longer cover expenses. Some retirees are now tapping their principal to make a decent living, pressed for time between decreasing investment balances and longer life expectancies.In today's economic environment, traditional income investments are not working.For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future.That means if you had $1 million in 10-year Treasuries, the difference in yield between 1999 and today is more than $1 million.Today's retirees are getting hit hard by reduced bond yields - and the Social Security picture isn't too rosy either. Right now and for the near future, Social Security benefits are still being paid, but it has been estimated that the Social Security funds will be depleted as soon as 2035.So what can retirees do? You could dramatically reduce your expenses, and go out on a limb hoping your Social Security benefits don't diminish. On the other hand, you could opt for an alternative investment that gives a steady, higher-rate income stream to supplant lessening bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesA rule of thumb for finding solid income-producing stocks is to seek those that average 3% dividend yield, and positive yearly dividend growth. These stocks can help combat inflation by boosting dividends over time.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Conagra Brands (CAG) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.33 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.93%. This compares to the Food - Miscellaneous industry's yield of 0% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.81%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 5.6%. Check Conagra Brands (CAG) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Pfizer (PFE) is paying out a dividend of $0.4 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.81% compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.82% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 2.56% over the past year. Check Pfizer (PFE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $1.5 per share, The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) has a dividend yield of 4.11%. This is compared to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.97% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 20%. Check The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc (PNC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?The fact is that stocks, as an asset class, carry more risk than bonds. To counterbalance this, invest in superior quality dividend stocks that not only can grow over time but more significantly, can also decrease your overall portfolio volatility with respect to the broader stock market.A silver lining to owning dividend stocks for your retirement portfolio is that many companies, especially blue chip stocks, increase their dividends over time, helping offset the effects of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you're thinking, ""I want to invest in a dividend-focused ETF or mutual fund,"" make sure to do your homework. It's important to know that some mutual funds and specialized ETFs charge high fees, which may diminish your dividend gains or income and thwart the overall objective of this investment strategy. If you do want to invest in fund, research well to identify the best-quality dividend funds with the least charges.Bottom LinePursuing a dividend investing strategy can help protect your retirement portfolio. Whether you choose to invest in stocks or through low-fee mutual funds or ETFs, this approach can potentially help you achieve a more secure and enjoyable retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Whenever major indices like S&amp;P 500 (NYSE:SPY) fall, bargain hunters, step in. They are scooping up discounted American firms for the long term. By taking advantage of the short-lived dips, investors will average down their price paid.Buy-and-hold investors have a very long timeframe for stocks. Inflation, higher interest rates, risks of war and de-globalization are the many worries for markets. This is increasing volatility in stock markets and reducing the opportunity to find the right undervalued high-growth stocks to buy.Markets discount a company’s stock price when they demand a higher margin of safety.

Investors dumped AMAT stock throughout this year, worried about macroeconomic headwinds. In addition, the supply chain disruption is slowing Applied’s growth rate.Long-term investors should accumulate AMAT stock. The semiconductor market will grow in the mid-to-high-single-digits. The industry is worth $1 trillion by 2030. Applied’s customers have high capital intensity. They will always need wafer fab equipment. Expect the company to post free cash flow growth as it rebounds from the weak market conditions.In 2023, Applied Materials will benefit from its heavy investments in panel processing and packaging. It has capabilities in wafers and larger substrates. Applied will realize growth from early investments during the bull phase of the chip cycle. This year, it reduced its spending. By cutting the cost of goods sold and operating expenses, the company maintained positive free cash flow.Story continuesThe semiconductor firm pays $1.04 a share in dividends.Best Buy (BBY)A photo of a Best Buy store front.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comBest Buy (NYSE:BBY) is an electronics specialty retailer. Management skillfully kept inventory at healthy levels. It will not need to sell goods at a steep discount to clear those goods.Best Buy has inventory in the gaming console, PC gaming, and virtual reality. Fortunately, those are all popular areas that consumers want. As Best Buy enters the holiday period, chances are good that its supply will meet that of consumer demand.Suppliers will keep innovating their products. Although consumers might struggle with lower disposable income, they cannot delay upgrading their technology for too long. Best Buy is the first place they will visit to fulfill that need.Compared with online retailers, this firm has competent sales staff. Totaltech support also gives customers reassurance. Should they require help, they may count on this retailer.To fuel its growth, Best Buy has experimental stores spread geographically. It is testing markets to optimize its store portfolio. This will lift same-store sales in future quarters making it one of the best undervalued high-growth stocks.CVS Health (CVS)earnings reports cvsSource: ShutterstockCVS Health (NYSE:CVS) reported strong revenue and adjusted operating growth. It also raised its adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year. Importantly, CVS increased its cash flow from the operations guidance range. This gives it the option to hike its dividend of $2.20 a share, or 2.21% annually. Alternatively, it could pay down its debt or buy back more shares.CVS stock could trade at new highs if it returned capital to loyal shareholders. Instead, the company is determined to fuel its growth by acquiring companies. The strategy works if it is buying deeply discounted targets. Until asset values for targets fall, CVS investors deserve a higher dividend instead.In 2023, CVS will have capital expenditure levels similar to that of this year. In addition, it will have similar cash flow levels. Markets would likely bid the stock higher if CVS built its cash levels on hand. By 2024, unprofitable target acquisitions might sell themselves at a big discount.Mondelez International (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockMondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) rallied after posting revenue growing by 8.1% Y/Y to $7.76 billion. It raised its organic net revenue growth outlook. It expects growth of 10% or higher.MDLZ stock trades at a seemingly high forward P/E of 21.6 times. However, it earned the premium. It posted strong top-line performance, driven by resilience in its categories. Consumers want to consume more chocolate and biscuits.In the emerging market, Mondelez said that the emerging markets lifted its results. For example, it benefited from broad-based strength from China to India to Brazil. Conversely, customer disruptions hurt its Europe operations. When inflation rates ease in Europe, Mondelez will post a rebound in margins.Mondelez enjoys a strong moat in the food industry. Consumers cannot live without chocolate. They will allocate some of their grocery budgets to keep buying this affordable indulgence.The company has the flexibility to raise product prices. If input costs rise, it will pass the higher costs to customers. They will willingly pay. Investors should buy MDLZ stock on any pullback.Target (TGT)an image of bullseye the target dog in a target storeSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.comTarget (NYSE:TGT) is a retailer that continues to manage its inventory as demand weakens. Still, category trends changed earlier this year. Customers altered their spending habits but still shop in-store and online at Target.In the back half of the year, Target has multiple seasonal strengths. The winter holiday celebrations will drive sales higher. Investors should watch for Target’s operating margins to hold around 7%. Last year, it posted margins of 6.8%, and 6.5% the year before that.Earlier this year, freight costs and elevated fuel prices hurt Target’s profitability. Today, inventory is likely lower while freight costs are down. Energy prices are not rising as fast as they once did. This will lower the firm’s input costs. It also increases the disposable income of Target’s customers.The supply chain constraint is not likely an ongoing issue. The company’s management team worked through those issues in a short period. This limited the damage to the business making it one of the undervalued high-growth stocks to keep on your radar.United Parcel Service (UPS)Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.Source: monticello / ShutterstockUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) posted a good quarter. Its revenue grew by 4.2% year over year to $24.2 billion in Q3. It expects to achieve an adjusted operating margin of 13.7% this year.UPS stock is a buy because the company will pay dividends worth $5.2 billion. It will also buy back at least $3 billion worth of stock. These actions will limit the downside risks in the stock.UPS will find around $300 million worth of productivity in the back half of the year. As a result, it will improve the delivery firm’s performance efficiencies. By tracking packages effectively and delivering them on or ahead of schedule, UPS will cut overtime hours. This will lower the company’s drive and staff costs.UPS has an appealing service compared to its competitors. For example, it offers a 7-day residential service. It also offers Saturday pickup for its business customers. This resulted in long-term revenue growth and market share expansion.Walmart (WMT)Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is addressing its bloated inventory issues. The strong uptrend in WMT stock since it bottomed in May suggests that shareholders are confident it will not hurt results.Furthermore, profitability expansion is achievable. The company will price its goods to reflect its cost structure.Walmart enjoys a strong brand name that draws customers to its stores. Both Walmart and Sam’s Club are recognized globally. This lowers its risk of relying solely on the U.S. for its strong performance. To strengthen its online presence, Walmart is investing in its e-commerce unit. It takes its digital transformation seriously.Investors should expect Walmart to grow its marketplace, despite the short-term pressures it faces. Fortunately, its online competitors are stumbling. This gives the company a rare chance to take market share.Just as supply chain constraints benefit the companies mentioned, Walmart will also see lower supply chain costs. Expect it to issue strong profit guidance when sales growth outpaces the rise in supply costs.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Fears of a resurgence of COVID-19 cases and the risk of a potential recession resulted in a decline in the majority of stocks. The downturn in stocks has made it difficult for growth investors as valuations of high-flying stocks have crashed significantly in the past year.However, the downturn has created opportunities for investments to drive long-term wealth creation. Investors can focus on companies with strong fundamentals and witnessing continued demand for their products and services amid macro headwinds as these could be the potential winners over the long term. The downtrend in stocks has also made some of these companies’ valuations attractive. Please note that the stock market is unlikely to continue its downtrend for a long period and should return to an uptrend over a longer time frame.Medical is one of the sectors that has been historically resilient amid recessionary headwinds as demand for medical services remains no matter what. Moreover, rising cases of different diseases, especially cancer and diabetes, create strong growth prospects for companies targeting these markets. Meanwhile, companies focused on treating rare diseases also hold the potential for robust growth due to less competition and higher margins.Here we discuss three companies from the Zacks – Medical sector that have a history of strong financial growth and with potential to generate wealth for investors over the next three to five years on the back of unique competitive advantages within their respective industries.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVertex Pharmaceuticals VRTXVertex has created a niche for itself by developing multiple popular and effective treatment options for patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). There are four CFTR modulator therapies available for treating CF patients — all developed and marketed by Vertex. These make it a clear leader in the field with no competition so far. The company’s newest and current flagship drug — Trikafta — raked in $3.65 billion in the first half of 2022, reflecting growth of nearly 50% year over year.Story continuesVertex’s strong product portfolio has made it resilient amid the recent downtrend in global stock markets. The company’s stock has gained 59.5% in the past year while the Medical sector declined 23.3% and the S&amp;P 500 was down 20.2% in the same time frame. A stock that has yielded positive returns during a downtrend is most likely to exhibit more strength when markets start to recover. Vertex is thus likely to witness strong growth over the next five years.While Vertex’s main focus is on the development and strengthening of its CF franchise, the company also has a rapidly advancing mid- to late-stage pipeline in additional diseases beyond CF like acute pain, sickle cell disease, beta-thalassemia, APOL1-mediated kidney diseases and cell therapy for type I diabetes. Many of these candidates represent multibillion-dollar opportunities. Programs in five disease areas are now entering or progressing through late-stage clinical development.Vertex currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). The company’s earnings are expected to grow 11.2% over the next five years.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated PriceVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated PriceVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated price | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated QuoteIntuitive Surgical ISRGIntuitive Surgical is a leader in the field of developing and manufacturing robotic surgical systems, paving the way for minimal-invasive surgeries across the globe. The company’s array of surgical products, especially the da Vinci system, used in everything from colorectal procedures to cardiac surgery, and the Ion system, used for minimally invasive peripheral lung biopsies, has been driving top-line growth for the company over the past decade. With strong adoption of robotic surgeries in key markets like the United States, Europe, Japan and China, Intuitive Surgical’s top-line growth seems to be secured for another decade.The robotic-assisted surgery market is expected to reach a valuation of $18.2 billion by 2030 from $4.4 billion in 2022. Intuitive Surgical is likely to gain the most from the growth in this space due to its leadership position. Although several new players are entering the market, ISRG currently serves nearly 80% of the market.However, the recent downturn in global stock markets had a significant impact on Intuitive Surgical’s share price. The company’s shares have plunged 43.7% in the past year amid COVID-related headwinds. The pandemic affected global supplies of semiconductors and other materials utilized in Intuitive Surgical’s products. Although the company is making efforts to secure the supply required to ensure the fulfillment of consumer demand, global shortages might lead to higher production costs or delay in production. Moreover, recent recession fears may keep the stock prices of this company near their lows.However, economies will eventually recover from the recession in the coming years, which will fuel demand. Intuitive Surgical is most likely to ride on an uptrend in global stock markets with its strong and innovative product portfolio as well as its global footprint. Moreover, the recent decline in its share price has made the company’s valuation attractive.Intuitive Surgical currently has a Zacks Rank of 2.

260,2b901526-e0d2-3c24-974d-ddb9de700828,CSX,2022-10-14,CSX (CSX) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/csx-csx-earnings-expected-grow-140002565.html,1665669602,STORY,['CSX'],"[Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when CSX (CSX) reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis freight railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.50 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +16.3%.Revenues are expected to be $3.78 billion, up 14.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.35% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for CSX?For CSX, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.50%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that CSX will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that CSX would post earnings of $0.47 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.50, delivering a surprise of +6.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.CSX doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:ADI) Trading At A 27% Discount?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-inc-nasdaq-adi-110108686.html,1665745268,STORY,['ADI'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices Is Analog Devices Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$4.72bUS$4.97bUS$5.83bUS$6.09bUS$6.29bUS$6.48bUS$6.65bUS$6.81bUS$6.97bUS$7.12bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 3.36%Est @ 2.95%Est @ 2.66%Est @ 2.45%Est @ 2.31%Est @ 2.21% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.7% US$4.4kUS$4.3kUS$4.7kUS$4.5kUS$4.3kUS$4.1kUS$3.9kUS$3.8kUS$3.6kUS$3.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$41bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$7.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.7%– 2.0%) = US$126bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$126b÷ ( 1 + 7.7%)10= US$60bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$101b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$143, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 27% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Analog Devices as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.229. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Analog Devices, we've put together three pertinent items you should consider:Risks: For instance, we've identified   3 warning signs for Analog Devices  that you should be aware of.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for ADI's future outlook?

On the bright side the returns have been quite good over the last half decade. It has returned a market beating 66% in that time.Although SBA Communications has shed US$4.2b from its market cap this week, let's take a look at its longer term fundamental trends and see if they've driven returns. Check out our latest analysis for SBA Communications To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Over half a decade, SBA Communications managed to grow its earnings per share at 61% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 11% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 74.36, the market remains optimistic.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how SBA Communications has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free interactive graphic.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for SBA Communications the TSR over the last 5 years was 70%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that SBA Communications returned a loss of 25% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 44%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for SBA Communications  you should be aware of, and 2 of them are concerning.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

(NYSE:V) shareholders may have reason to be concerned, as several insiders sold their shares over the past year. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for Visa The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At VisaThe insider, James Hoffmeister, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$402k worth of shares at a price of US$231 each. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$185. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.In the last year Visa insiders didn't buy any company stock.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Visa insiders own about US$191m worth of shares (which is 0.05% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Visa Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Visa shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Visa insider transactions don't fill us with confidence.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corporation (MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) and Eli Lilly and Company (LLY). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Microsoft shares have held up relatively better compared to the software space (down -23.2% over the past year against the Zacks Computer - Software industry’s decline of -31.6%) and modestly worst than the broader market's -20.4% decline. Beyond some softening demand for the company's services over the near to medium-term as a result of rising interest rates in response to inflationary pressures, Microsoft's business is as rock solid today as it was last year. The company’s increasing spend on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space from Amazon is likely to dent margins. However, Microsoft’s performance is benefiting from strength in its Azure cloud platform amid accelerated global digital transformation.Teams’ user growth is gaining from continuation of remote work and mainstream adoption of hybrid/flexible work model. Recovery in advertising and job market boosted LinkedIn and Search revenues. Solid uptake of new Xbox consoles is aiding the gaming segment performance.The company is witnessing growth in user base of its different applications including Microsoft 365 suite, Dynamics and Power Platform. Microsoft expects Surface revenues to grow in the mid-teens range, driven by strong demand for premium devices.(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Alphabet shares have lost -32.3% of thier value in the year-to-date period vs. -35.7% decline for the Zacks Internet Services industry and -25.5% decline for the S&amp;P 500 index. A relatively subdued ad spending outlook given the macroeconomic headwinds is the biggest worry in the Alphabet story. But this is no more than a short to medium-term issue, as the long-term outlook for all of Alphabet's businesses, including digital advertizing, remians favorable. Story continuesThe Zacks analysts believes for 2022, Google Cloud revenue to grow 24.7% from 2021. Further, major updates in its search segment are enhancing the search results. Moreover, Google’s mobile search is gaining solid momentum. For 2022, we anticipate Google Search revenue to be up 11% from the last year.Also, strong focus on innovation of AI techniques and the home automation space should continue aiding Alphabet’s business growth in the days ahead. Its deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Also, Alphabet’s expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is contributing well. Considering the aforesaid factors, we expect 2022 total revenue to grow 10.3% from 2021.(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Eli Lilly shares have outperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (+37.2% vs. +6.5%). The company’s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Trulicity, Taltz, and others. It is regularly adding promising new pipeline assets through business development deals.Lilly expects to launch five new medicines by 2023 end including Mounjaro for type II diabetes (already launched) and donanemab for early Alzheimer's disease. Both drugs have multibillion dollar sales potential.However, generic competition for several drugs, rising pricing pressure in the United States mainly on key drug, Trulicity, and price cuts in some international markets like China, Japan and Europe are some top-line headwinds. Estimates have gone down slightly ahead of Q3 results. Lilly has a negative record of earnings surprises in the recent quarters.(You can read the full research report on Eli Lilly here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Visa Inc.

Also, its solid post-sale-driven business model is a tailwind.New DowngradesHigher Costs &amp; Weak Demand Hurt PPG Industries (PPG)The Zacks analyst is concerned that weaker demand in Europe and China could hurt PPG's sales volumes.

A CDN is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their respective data centers. CDNs sprung up in the late 1990s as means to optimize traffic flow and enhance the distribution of content through bottlenecks on the Internet.The CDN market is a branch of the wider global consumer electronics market. According to a recent market analysis report, the global CDN market growth is expected to accelerate at a CAGR of 26.84% from 2022 to 2026. The size of the CDN market is expected to achieve incremental growth by nearly $51.3 billion. The market is highly diverse and fragmented with multiple players occupying the competitive landscape. The fact that the CDN market is expected to grow 24.57% in 2022 whilst the global economic growth rate has plummeted to 2.2% makes CDN stocks a highly safe and profitable bet for investors who are reeling from losses brought about by the severe economic crisis.The growth of the CDN market can be attributed to the recent rise in server availability post the 2020 pandemic. CDNs are able to utilize servers and distribute content accordingly, thereby networking traffic to these servers. CDN solutions have taken firm footing during the pandemic, with multiple organizations using CDNs to increase their digital footprint, and boost traffic on their websites. Content delivery clouds aid in enhancing the delivery service abilities of web applications and facilitate research which improves scalability, robustness of systems, etc. Some of the major players in the CDN sector include Verizon Communications Inc.

(NYSE:GDDY) in their Q3 2021 investor letter:“GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY)  in particular sold off after reporting quarterly earnings in early August. Yet they are still growing the top line by more than 10 percent per annum. Short term pain creates opportunity. Presently GDDY (NYSE:GDDY) trades at a greater than 5.5 percent trailing FCF yield, and a 7.2 percent 2021 yield based on my own (lower than consensus) estimation. Deferred revenue continues to improve. CEO Aman Bhutani and team have done an excellent job rebranding the company. I’m confident they will continue to address challenges along the way and keep GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY) on the right path.”6. Cloudflare Inc.

The company's resilience was put on display when it achieved remarkable revenue growth in 2022 despite elongated sales cycles amongst larger customers. Security is the central revenue stream for Cloudflare Inc. (NYSE:NET), and with security budgets less likely to get cut in the event of a downturn, the company is more or less recession-proof. Furthermore, Cloudflare's (NYSE:NET) large customer base is increasing exponentially, representing nearly 59% of the total revenue in Q2 2022, compared to 46% in 2020.Here is what Baron Funds had to say about Cloudflare Inc. (NYSE:NET) in their Q2 2022 investor letter:“Despite posting solid quarterly results with 54% revenue growth, and a record addition of 14,000 customers, shares of Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), a software infrastructure provider, declined 63% in the quarter along with other fast-growing names in the software universe that penalize current profitability by reinvesting back in their businesses. We believe Cloudflare’s (NYSE:NET) disruptive global platform and unmatched pace of innovation will enable the company to continue to take share across multiple large addressable markets for years to come.”   Click here to continue reading and see 5 Best Content Delivery Network Stocks To Buy Now.     Suggested Articles:Best Casino Stocks To BuyBest Chemical Stocks To BuyTop 10 Data Center Companies In the US Disclosure: none. 11 Best Content Delivery Network Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Verizon is partnering with Collaboratory, a local non-profit community-problem solving organization in Southwest Florida, and Florida TaxWatch, a trusted non-profit organization that serves as the ‘eyes and ears’ of Florida taxpayers and promotes economic development across the state, to create $10,000 grants to provide small businesses in the hardest-hit areas of Florida with critical relief.“We are committed to helping small businesses who have been affected by this terrible tragedy,” said Aparna Khurjekar, Chief Revenue Officer, Business Markets and SaaS at Verizon Business. “Many of these businesses are dealing with insurmountable challenges, ranging from functional and operational disruptions to the destruction of property. We hope that this donation will help accelerate business recovery and provide assistance for the small business communities affected by Hurricane Ian during their time of need.”“Hurricane Ian has significantly impacted the livelihood of many small business owners in Southwest Florida and nearly 20 counties in the peninsula,” said Dominic M. Calabro, President and CEO of Florida TaxWatch. “Florida TaxWatch is proud to be partnering with Verizon Business and Collaboratory to offer grants to many of these hard-working people, supporting them and their families, as part of our ongoing work.”“Collaboratory understands that local small businesses are part of the lifeblood of our community,” said Sarah Owen, President and CEO of Collaboratory. “They employ our workforce, create new innovative solutions and ideas, and drive our economic future. Assisting these businesses post-storm is a critical component of the rebuilding of Southwest Florida. Donations like this one from Verizon Business help us to do just that.”Story continuesOngoing Disaster Recovery EffortsVerizon engineers are continuing their efforts this week to add capacity to the network to support the tremendous data usage increase we’re seeing compared to pre-storm levels. The influx of recovery teams to the area, coupled with customers using wireless service while their home internet service is out, has increased data traffic on the network by more than 70% in some locations.Engineers continue to add 5G service using C-band spectrum, repair radio heads and realign antennas which will help optimize network performance. Teams are also continuing to increase the capacity and stability of the satellite, fiber and microwave links that connect cell sites back to the rest of the network so those sites can manage more data traffic. Lastly, engineers continue to deploy additional mobile cell sites to supplement coverage and capacity in extremely busy areas of Southwest Florida.Further, the Verizon Frontline Crisis Response Team has deployed more than 400 Verizon Frontline solutions, including drones, smartphones, routers, mobile hotspots, portable satellite assets, and THOR (Tactical Humanitarian Operations Response), a one-of-a-kind private 5G network-capable mobile emergency operations vehicle, to support first responders in their search and rescue missions.More recovery efforts can be seen on the Verizon Response to Hurricane Ian page, which will continue to be updated regularly.Free Learning Resources Available to Small BusinessesSmall businesses can also access Verizon Small Business Digital Ready, a free, comprehensive online curriculum focused on helping small businesses with digital transformation.

It is the part of the network that enables IP connectivity between a customer on the Verizon network and the services that a customer wants to use such as Internet access, voice calls, and enterprise applications. A higher level of operational autonomy unleashed in Verizon’s 5G core design will be critical for the next generation of services being enabled by new network technologies to serve consumer and enterprise customers.“Our mission has always been to build and operate the best, most reliable, highest performing, and secure networks in the world,” said Adam Koeppe, Senior Vice President of Network Technology, Strategy, and Planning at Verizon.  “The 5G Core is a critical step in achieving our goal. From the densification and virtualization work in the Radio Access Network, to the architectural design changes in the core of the network developed specifically for telco workloads, we are working to ensure customers not only have access to 5G, but have the most advanced, secure, and robust network to support the remarkable new solutions being developed on 5G technology.”Story continuesThe Verizon Cloud Platform (VCP), on which the 5G core is built, is based on a Webscale software architecture with advanced technologies designed specifically for telco workloads. VCP is a distributed platform that supports edge services, private cloud services, Network Function Virtualization tools, Cloud Native Functions, Web applications, mapping and spatial analysis tools, orchestration tools, service assurance tools, auto-remediation, and compute offerings. Using VCP, Verizon’s 5G core will be able to achieve new levels of operational automation and adaptability to create differentiated customer experiences. This directional technology platform that enables MEC will support stand alone, non-stand alone, and VoNR services.Benefits of the 5G CoreThe advanced capabilities, high speed, increased bandwidth, and low latency of 5G is inspiring development of a wide variety of new use cases that include everything from massive numbers of IoT devices that use very few network resources, to smartphones with nearly infinite opportunities to use data, to more complex solutions such as AR/VR and mixed reality that will require massive computing capabilities and low latency on the edge of the network. Those solutions will each require different combinations of network capabilities. The 5G standalone core’s cloud-native virtualized applications, in combination with built-in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), will enable the dynamic allocation of the appropriate resources, referred to as network slicing. It will also allow for automated network configuration changes, including the ability to scale up or scale down network function capacity - to provide the right service levels and network resources needed for each use case.In addition to network slicing and dynamic resource allocation, Verizon’s new 5G core will provide other benefits:Real-time resource management of Radio Access Network and core virtual container-based network functionsAdvanced analytics of network data to improve network performanceOptimized services between Verizon's fixed and mobile networksScalable, more cost-efficient architectureAbility to move workloads to fit use case requirements“Bringing traffic onto the newly designed core coincides with the ecosystem development around us. With a critical number of customers now having devices that can access the advanced features of the 5G core and the solutions and applications development – especially for enterprise customers – really taking off, now is the ideal time to move traffic onto the new core,” said Koeppe.Media contact: Karen Schulz864-561-1527Karen.Schulz@Verizonwireless.com]"

Actively engaging with tech while learning life skills can be a powerful combination, and that know-how translates into higher education and adulthood, as Frayre and Martinez share.With newfound confidence and support from a network of similarly-minded friends and mentors, these two Hispanic alumni share how Verizon Innovative Learning better prepared them for long-term success.Sila Frayre: A future supply chain aceEven as a high school student, Sila Frayre was interested in business and innovation. Frayre's senior year in Phoenix, AZ, she got involved with Verizon Innovative Learning as part of a marketing class. In one challenge, teams of students designed and developed an app to solve a specific problem. Frayre's team zeroed in on the cumbersome process of navigating a grocery store; they developed a shopping app to guide a shopper through a store, navigating through the aisles item by item via their shopping list. The app, Shop Easy, won Best in State at DECA, an international career development conference.The student team developed their idea from the ground up, including producing a video to explain their pitch, which also taught them presentation and team-building skills. For Frayre, the work had an eye-opening takeaway. ""It really helped with the concept of creating something, then building a business plan and pitching it to an audience,"" says Frayre. ""I think that was one of the biggest skills that I learned through the program.""Frayre praises the real-life, hands-on experiences she gained in the Verizon program with preparing her for college, as well as her career after graduation. ""We weren't just doing the regular curriculum; we were doing other things that allowed us to get more experience outside of the day-to-day courses that we were taking,"" she explains.Story continuesToday, Frayre is working as a logistics analyst, after graduating with a bachelor's degree from Arizona State University. Next up for this young innovator: She hopes to start her own company.Ivan Martinez: From back row to head of the classIvan Martinez recently completed his freshman year at Cal State, near his hometown in East LA. It's a school he knew from his days as a high school student when he attended Verizon Innovative Learning STEM Achievers at Cal State Los Angeles.Back in the day, Martinez described himself as the type of student who kept to himself in the back of the classroom. Although he was interested in engineering and coding, his high school didn't offer any coursework in those STEM topics. He credits the Verizon program with vaulting him ahead when it came to computer programming. Despite going to a math and science school, Martinez says, ""there was no programming in my classes. I liked that I was taking initiative and was ahead.""Along with the STEM coursework, Martinez says he benefited from the camaraderie of students who were interested in the same things. ""The program really got me to open up to other people,"" he says. Martinez also mentored younger students in Verizon's program, which he attributes to helping him gain admission to Cal State. Today, Martinez has many doors open to him: he is a pre-psychology major and will graduate with the class of 2025.To learn more about the Verizon Innovative Learning STEM Achievers program, click here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Verizon on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: VerizonWebsite: http://www.verizon.com/responsibilityEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: VerizonView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/720312/Hispanic-Students-Find-the-Foundation-for-Success-Through-STEM]"

The company's market worth decreased by US$16b over the past week after the stock price dropped 9.4%, although insiders were able to minimize their lossesWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications Verizon Communications Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe , Tamara Erwin, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$49.77 each. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$35.68. So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it. Tamara Erwin was the only individual insider to sell shares in the last twelve months.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. Verizon Communications insiders own about US$26m worth of shares. That equates to 0.02% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Verizon Communications Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by Verizon Communications insiders. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company.

(NYSE:TPR)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-tapestry-inc-nyse-tpr-143756197.html,1665671876,STORY,['TPR'],"[While Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) might not be the most widely known stock at the moment, it saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$37.57 and falling to the lows of US$28.43. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Tapestry's current trading price of US$31.21 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Tapestry’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. Check out our latest analysis for Tapestry Is Tapestry Still Cheap?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Tapestry’s ratio of 8.82x is trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 8.9x, which means if you buy Tapestry today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that Tapestry should be trading at this level in the long run, then there’s not much of an upside to gain over and above other industry peers. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Tapestry’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Tapestry generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Tapestry's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 33%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in TPR’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at TPR? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on TPR, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for TPR, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

All of these reasons have created a volatile market situation which has created negative sentiments among investors specifically in cyclical sectors like tech.Further impacting AMD’s share price negatively is the company’s recent third-quarter 2022 revenue forecast. It forecasted third-quarter 2022 revenues to be approximately $5.6 billion, an increase of 29% year over year, lower than the previously expected rise of roughly 55%.AMD’s preliminary results reflect lower-than-expected client segment revenues resulting from reduced processor shipments due to weaker demand in the PC market and significant inventory correction actions across the PC supply chain.AMD expects a non-GAAP gross margin of approximately 50%, down 400 basis points due to lowered client segment revenues.The volatile macroeconomic situation has the broader tech sector in the doldrums as AMD’s peers in the sector NVIDIA NVDA and Intel INTC also bore the brunt of the situation.NVDA and Intel shares have fallen 58.9% and 50%, respectively, in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Semiconductor – General industry’s decline of 50.1%.However, the company is expecting a significant rise in its high-growth business segments like data center and gaming, in line with its previous guidance. AMD expects Data Center and gaming business to grow 45% and 14%, respectively, year over year. The company is also benefitting from its recent collaborations with organizations like The Energy Sciences Network in high-performance computing (HPC) and high-performance network business segment.Story continuesAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

QuoteAMD Boosting Top Line by Addressing High-Growth MarketsAMD recently announced that it has collaborated with the Energy Sciences Network (ESnet) to launch ESnet6, the latest generation of the U.S. Department of Energy’s high-performance network.This collaboration with ESnet is an extension of the partnership it built back in 2018. The recent expansion of agreement will help AMD fend off the stiff competition that the company faces from its peers NVIDIA and Intel in its various business segments.NVIDIA is a dominant name in the data center, professional visualization and gaming markets, where its peers are close on its heels. NVDA has been benefiting from the rapid proliferation of AI. The company has been expanding its base in untapped markets like climate science, energy research, space exploration and digital biology.Intel is still the leading name in the consumer PC market and is the major competitor of AMD in this segment. INTC is gradually reducing its dependence on the PC-centric business by transitioning to data-centric businesses such as AI and autonomous driving.Nevertheless, AMD, which currently has Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), is expected to benefit from its plans to address new markets, accelerate data center growth and enter the AI and Augmented Reality spaces with its launch of various products by building strategic partnerships with companies like Dell Technologiesand OEM partners Hewlett Packard HPE, Acer and Lenovo. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.AMD is also leading its peers in the HPC business segment as it enables customers across various fields like manufacturing, life sciences, financial services, climate research and more to utilize supercomputers for research purposes.AMD partnered with Hewlett Packard and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory to build the world’s fastest and most energy-efficient supercomputer — Frontier.It is also worth mentioning that AMD powers five of the top 10 most powerful and eight of the top 10 most energy-efficient supercomputers globally.

The Taiwanese group cutting its budget for 2022, but shares higher on better than expected results. For more, we have Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre. Ines, more gloom for the chip sector under a lot of pressure already.INES FERRE: Yeah, that's right. And if we look at the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, I mean, right now, it's rebounding. But it had opened lower. It was down as much as 4% earlier today. And a four-day chart will show you that it's down 5%, and a year to date chart shows it is down 43%.But let's get to that chip sector that you were just mentioning. And TSMC, that it beat on the top and the bottom line, cutting capital spending and also warning about slowing consumer demand. So moving into the fourth quarter, TSMC warning that it's seeing demand flattish. Right now, it's rebounding. The stock is up 7%.But I also just want to mention that, look, the chip sector has been dealing with the fallout of the new government regulations, the Biden administration's export controls. So you've got Applied Materials, Lam Research, Applied Materials saying that their fourth quarter is going to be impacted by this new regulation. So you've got this regulation on the one hand, and then you've got some of these chip makers that are talking about slowing consumer demand, on the other hand, impacting.And keep in mind that the chip sector also is going through periodic cycles. So it was expected that in the second half of the year, that we would see demand slowed down, slower. And it's-- these stocks are such that they've kind of been the way the pandemic style stocks have been-- really high during the pandemic and then losing steam this year. Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Hey, we don't need any nuance on that. We know the hit that they've been taking, and a lot of green on that board. It was red quite a bit earlier.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's so lofty.With earnings growth that's inferior to most other companies of late, NVIDIA has been relatively sluggish. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this lacklustre earnings performance will improve markedly. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for NVIDIA peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on NVIDIA.How Is NVIDIA's Growth Trending?NVIDIA's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Taking a look back first, we see that the company managed to grow earnings per share by a handy 8.8% last year. This was backed up an excellent period prior to see EPS up by 176% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 11% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.5% per annum, which is not materially different.With this information, we find it interesting that NVIDIA is trading at a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly average growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. These shareholders may be setting themselves up for disappointment if the P/E falls to levels more in line with the growth outlook.The Bottom Line On NVIDIA's P/EWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Story continuesWe've established that NVIDIA currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is only in line with the wider market. Right now we are uncomfortable with the relatively high share price as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support such positive sentiment for long. Unless these conditions improve, it's challenging to accept these prices as being reasonable.A lot of potential risks can sit within a company's balance sheet.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Apple Inc. AAPL, Snap Inc. SNAP and Autodesk Inc. ADSK.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:5 Stocks to Gain from the Flourishing Metaverse SpaceThe pandemic-led social transformation has established digitization as the new normal. The outbreak of coronavirus quickly changed the lifestyle and lookout of people. People who were not entirely used to digital platforms for doing office work (working from home), ordering food and other daily needs, transferring money and making payments are now fully tuned to these activities.In 2020, UNCTAD reported ""The global crisis brought on by the coronavirus pandemic has pushed us further into a digital world, and changes in behavior are likely to have lasting effects when the economy starts to pick up. The future will be much more digital than the past. This is going to provide a major impetus for the development of artificial intelligence, and cyberspace activities.”Metaverse – The Latest AdventThe latest advent of the digitization space is the metaverse. In a nutshell, metaverse means a virtual world that is interactive and collaborative. The digital space is powered by the use of virtual and augmented reality.According to a Bloomberg estimate, the market opportunity for the metaverse is expected to reach $800 billion by 2024 from $500 billion in 2020. The primary market for online game makers and gaming hardware may top $400 billion in 2024 while the remaining business will come from live entertainment and social media. Gaming, AR and VR create a $413 billion primary market for the metaverse.According to Verified Market Research, citing a PRNewswire article, the metaverse market size, in reality, is estimated to reach $824.53 billion by 2030 from $27.21 billion in 2020. The market is expected to witness a CAGR of 39.1% from 2022 to 2030.Story continuesStocks to WatchWe have narrowed our search to five stocks that have the potential to become major players in the metaverse space.NVIDIA Corp. is benefiting from strong growth in GeForce desktop and notebook graphics processing units (GPU), which is boosting gaming revenues. NVDA’s state-of-the-art GPUs are likely to play an important role in metaverse development. NVIDIA’s acquisition of Mellanox is a key catalyst in this regard.The NVIDIA Omniverse Enterprise platform is an end-to-end collaboration and simulation platform that fundamentally transforms complex design workflows in 3D space. This virtual content creation platform enables designers, creators and engineers to easily share their material in a digital space.Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) NVDA has an estimated revenue growth rate of 2% for the current year (ending January 2023) and 14.4% for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year and next year earnings has improved 1.2% and 0.4%, respectively, in the past 30 days.Alphabet Inc. has been growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market. GOOGL’s cloud offerings include Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace, which are gaining momentum in the booming cloud computing market.Further, Alphabet’s growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI remain major developments in the metaverse space. GOOGL’s growing efforts toward strengthening its presence in the booming wearable space remain noteworthy.Zacks Rank #3 Alphabet has an estimated revenue growth rate of 11.6% for the current year and 10% for the next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year and next year’s earnings have improved 0.2% and 0.2%, respectively in the past 30 days.Apple Inc. is encouraging developers to use artificial intelligence and machine learning in their apps. AAPL’s focus on autonomous vehicles and augmented reality/virtual reality technologies presents a growth opportunity for the long haul.To ramp up its efforts, Apple has acquired several smaller firms with expertise in AR hardware, 3D gaming and VR software. These include SensoMotoric, Flyby Media, Emotient, TupleJump, Turi, Metaio, PrimeSense and Lattice Data Inc. In addition, AAPL’s ARKit is helping third-party developers to work on creating AR experiences for its iOS platform.Zacks Rank #3 Apple has an estimated revenue and earnings per share growth rate of 4.5% and 6.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending September 2023). AAPL came up with earnings beat in each of the last four reported quarters.Snap Inc. is continuing to focus on developing AR hardware through its Spectacle smart glasses. The adoption of the company’s AR lenses has been strong, particularly post the launch of Lens Studio 2. At the end of 2020, Snap launched its first-ever 5G-enabled Landmarker Lens (a new tool for overlaying AR on the world) in partnership with Verizon. The Lens uses SNAP’s augmented reality technology and Verizon’s 5G Ultra-Wideband capabilities.The solid adoption of products like Scan and AR Bar is driving the usage of AR-based lenses, providing significant growth opportunities to SNAP. Moreover, the launch of Local Lenses, which enables shared and persistent AR experiences in much larger areas around the world, is expected to aid user engagement.Snap added Cartoon Lens powered by real-time machine learning to its portfolio. Moreover, the launch of music Lenses in Lens Explorer and Dynamic Lenses, which allow developers to bring real-time information from their app into Snapchat Lenses, is a key catalyst.SNAP has an estimated revenue growth rate of 13.8% for the current year and 15.7% for next year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year and next-year earnings has improved 66.7% and 20%, respectively in the past 30 days. Snap carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

ADSK is well-positioned to capitalize on the rapid adoption of computer-aided designing and manufacturing through its comprehensive product portfolio.Higher demand for Autodesk’s cloud-based products (BIM 360 cloud platform, Shotgun and Fusion Lifecycle), mobile products (AutoCAD 360) and design suites will drive top-line growth. ADSK is also benefiting from its investment in digital infrastructure, which includes its e-store.Zacks Rank #3 Autodesk has an estimated revenue and earnings per share growth rate of 14.3% and 30.2%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2023).

294,d4ef0155-4726-39be-a637-24fa93cec0a4,MCK,2022-10-14,What's in Store for Abbott Laboratories (ABT) in Q3 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-store-abbott-laboratories-abt-170505049.html,1665680705,STORY,"['ABT', 'MCK', 'CRL', 'HUM']","[Abbott Laboratories ABT is slated to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 19, before market open.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 31.19%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all the occasions, the average beat being 28.23%.Let's see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayThe ongoing inflationary pressure, a strengthening U.S. dollar and supply chain issues are expected to have adversely impacted Abbott’s overall third-quarter performance. Going by the industry-wide trend so far, logistical challenges and increasing unit cost might have weighed on corporate profitability of the company. Not just this, the existing healthcare staffing challenges and diminishing demand for COVID-testing products may also have weighed on the company through the Q3 months. The lockdown issues in limited geographies, including China where the company has extensive base, are expected to have also impacted the business during the third quarter.On a positive note, in the months of the third quarter, a significant rise in the number of monkeypox cases in the United States and other major developed as well as emerging economies are expected to have accelerated testing volume globally, giving a boost to Abbott’s Diagnostics business revenues. According to the company, with the emergence of new viruses that escape immunity, rapid tests have become the best tool to help slow and prevent transmission.Abbott Laboratories Price and EPS SurpriseAbbott Laboratories Price and EPS SurpriseAbbott Laboratories price-eps-surprise | Abbott Laboratories QuoteWorldwide Diagnostic sales are expected to have demonstrated growth in Q3 on the continuous rollout of Alinity, Abbott’s suite of diagnostic instruments as well as expanding menus across the company’s testing platforms.Within Nutrition, total worldwide Nutrition and Pediatric Nutrition sales are expected to have declined in Q3, thanks to a voluntary recall and manufacturing shutdown of certain infant formula products manufactured at one of Abbott's U.S. plants since last February. These include the company’s market-leading Similac and Elecare. Though the company announced an update on the resumption of partial production at the facility, starting with the specialty formula EleCare and metabolic formulas, business recovery might take some more time. Also, per the last update, the company is yet to restart Similac production. All these are expected to have caused a year-over-year dip in the pediatric nutrition business.Story continuesAbbott’s other consumer-facing businesses, which include diabetes care and established pharmaceuticals, have been catching up, backed by new product instructions. This uptrend is likely to have majorly contributed to the company's third-quarter performance.Within Established Pharmaceuticals Division (EPD), the company has been witnessing visible signs of a rebound, reflecting sequential improvement based on its stable business model. New product launches across key emerging markets have been majorly boosting the EPD business in recent months. The third-quarter performance is likely to have been driven by growing customer demand for core therapeutic lines, including cardiometabolic, respiratory and central nervous system/pain management.Revenues are likely to have improved in the company’s Diabetes Care business, as it has been on a substantially strong growth trajectory in recent times. Abbott has been in the limelight for developments in its flagship, sensor-based continuous glucose monitoring system, widely known as the FreeStyle Libre System.EstimatesFor third-quarter 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues of $9.59 billion indicates a 12.2% dip from the prior-year comparable quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 89 cents, suggesting a 36.4% decline year on year.Earnings WhispersPer our proven model, a stock with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) has a higher chance of beating estimates. However, that is not the case here as you can see:Earnings ESP: Abbott has an Earnings ESP of -2.52%.

295,a09a4fc3-cc1c-394f-be80-4a0c7d233750,MCK,2022-10-14,Here's Why You Should Retain Cardinal Health (CAH) Stock Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-retain-cardinal-health-165204010.html,1665679924,STORY,"['CAH', 'MCK']","[Cardinal Health Inc. CAH is well-poised for growth on the back of a diversified product portfolio, acquisition-driven strategy and a robust pharmaceutical segment. However, margin contraction remains a concern.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 39.6% on a year-to-date basis against the industry's decline of 15.2%. The S&amp;P 500 Index has fallen 20.2% in the same time frame.The company — with a market capitalization of $18.43 billion — is a nationwide drug distributor and a provider of services to pharmacies, healthcare providers and manufacturers. It anticipates earnings to improve 10.7% over the next five years. Cardinal Health's earnings yield is 7.4% compared with the industry's 5.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat's Driving the Performance?Cardinal Health's Medical and Pharmaceutical offerings provide it with a competitive edge in its niche area of operations. It offers industry expertise through an expanding portfolio of safe products.The company pursues an acquisition-driven strategy and remains committed to investment in key growth businesses to gain market traction and bolster profits.Cardinal Health's Pharmaceutical segment is the second-largest pharmaceutical distributor in the United States. The segment's products and services comprise pharmaceutical distribution, manufacturer and specialty solutions, and nuclear and pharmacy offerings. The segment's strength is expected to drive its performance in the days ahead.In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, pharmaceutical revenues amounted to $43.3 billion, up 13.1% on a year-over-year basis. The performance reflects branded pharmaceutical sales growth from Pharmaceutical Distribution and Specialty Solutions customers.On the fiscal fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call, the company stated that it has been witnessing continued commercial momentum with Navista TS.Notable DevelopmentsIn July, Cardinal Health acquired a smart platform for transferring prescriptions directly to patients through a secure mobile app — ScalaMed. The acquisition is likely to boost Cardinal Health’s digital connectivity, consequently leading to higher patient satisfaction and greater medication adherence. It has the potential to bring more patients to the system, thereby boosting Cardinal Health’s top line going forward. The company acquired the Bendcare group purchasing organization (CPO-GPO) entity in the same month to strengthen its specialty solutions business. The buyout is likely to expand Cardinal Health's distribution opportunities and technology solution offerings for specialty practices.Story continuesIn June, Cardinal Health partnered with Zipline and began long-range drone deliveries in North Carolina. The latest partnership between the two companies is aimed at transforming patients’ experience while improving care delivery. It is aimed at mitigating the inventory stock-out risks and lessening the barriers for patients accessing necessary products, especially in difficult-to-reach areas. During the same month, CAH expanded its warehouse footing by adding a new distribution center in the Columbus, OH, area to support its at-Home Solutions business. This move is likely to have provided a boost to Cardinal Health’s pharmaceutical distribution capability, which is included as one of the services in the Pharmaceutical business.What's Weighing on the Stock?In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, gross profit increased 9% year over year to $1.61 billion. However, gross margin contracted 6 basis points year over year, which reflects rising costs. The inflationary pressure is likely to continue in the next few quarters. The company reported a significant decline in operating income to $36 million during the last reported quarter compared with $162 million in the year-ago quarter.With respect to the Medical segment, revenues fell 11% to $3.8 billion due to the divestiture of the Cordis business. The company reported a loss of $16 million for the Medical segment. The company recorded a loss during the quarter, primarily due to net inflationary impacts and global supply chain restrictions in products and distribution. These macro headwinds are likely to continue for the rest of the calendar year 2022.Cardinal Health, Inc. PriceCardinal Health, Inc. PriceCardinal Health, Inc. price | Cardinal Health, Inc. QuoteEstimates TrendFor fiscal 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $193.31 billion, indicating an improvement of 6.6% from the previous year's reported number.The same for adjusted earnings per share stands at $5.21, suggesting a rise of 3% from the year-ago reported figure.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the broader medical space are Inogen INGN, CheckCap CHEK and McKesson MCK.

This was up 34%on a pro forma basisversus the year-ago quarter’s combined result.Within the segment, the Shields business rose 48% on a pro forma basis versus their standalone results in the year-ago quarter.

The current Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.57.Our Take Walgreens Boots exited fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 with better-than-expected earnings. However, earnings declined significantly on a year-over-year basis. Lower COVID-19 vaccination volumes in the reported quarter, macroeconomic headwinds and rising expenses impacted the bottom line. Fourth-quarter sales too missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and declined on a year-over-year basis, majorly impacted by a 660-bp impact from the anticipated sales decline at AllianceRx Walgreens.The company’s International segment reported strong growth, banking on a continued rally in the Boots UK business and growth in the company’s German wholesale business.Walgreens Boots however raised the U.S. Healthcare fiscal 2025 sales target to a band of $11 billion-$12 billion, from $9 billion-$10 billion earlier.

This compares to earnings of $0.14 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -60.48%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this insurer would post earnings of $0.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.95, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Progressive , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry, posted revenues of $13 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.23%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $11.82 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Progressive shares have added about 18.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -25%.What's Next for Progressive?While Progressive has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Progressive: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.61 on $13.21 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.62 on $50.85 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Insurance - Property and Casualty is currently in the bottom 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Travelers (TRV), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on October 19.This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -29.6%.

If you want to read about some more industrial dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.The industrial sector has been dealing with the twin pressures of labor shortages and supply chain disruptions as macro uncertainties like inflation and rising rates batter the economy. According to a report by research firm Deloitte, there is likely to be a shortfall of 2.1 million skilled jobs by 2030. This environment has kept the optimism around revenue growth in the sector in check even as the economic recovery in the post-pandemic world gathers pace with the lifting of virus restrictions and the resumption of international travel. Another important factor influencing growth in the industrial space is the challenges to transportation that are likely to continue beyond 2022. Some of these include driver shortages in trucking and congestion at US container ports. As demand outpaces supply, higher costs are more likely to be passed on to customers, per Deloitte. However, an acceleration in digital technology adoption could bring operational efficiencies to scale in this regard. Sustainability initiatives are also important and factoring into cost of capital. Investors who want to look for solid companies with reliable dividend track records to ride the upcoming market storm should invest in some of the best industrial stocks like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM). Research firm RSM US claims that investments in resilient supply chains and digital tech, in light of geopolitical tensions and rising inflation, will be the two most important trends shaping the future of the industrial world.Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the industrial sector and have solid dividend profiles were selected for the list. The firms with dividend yields above 1.5% as of October 13 and a more than 10-year track record of payouts were preferred. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues10 Best Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy NowChristian Lagerek/Shutterstock.comBest Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy Now10. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33      Dividend Yield as of October 13: 2.72%Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) engages in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. It is one of the best industrial stocks to invest in. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)'s near-term revenue growth should benefit from healthy demand in the commodity-related and capital goods markets. With the opening of onsite locations and the installation of FMIs, the long-term growth prospects for the company look solid as well.On July 15, Argus analyst John Eade kept a Buy rating on Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) stock and lowered the price target to $55 from $66, noting that the company’s core business trends remained positive.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 33 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $893 million in Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST), compared to 29 the preceding quarter worth $1 billion.Just like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) is one of the best industrial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, Nomadic Value Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In mid-June we completely sold out of Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST). Although we had been using FAST as a source of liquidity for a few months already, it still feels bad to say an official goodbye to such an amazing company. However, we must stay focused on the math and the math concludes a difficult task to get our return hurdle going forward. The last time FAST traded at a forward P/E ratio of 34x (the multiple at our exit), the year was 2012. The company had been growing at 20% per year, and the US was about to embark on a shale oil boom, sustaining a low-teens growth trajectory. Today, FAST’s sales growth could turn anemic as the surge for COVID safety products is waning and heavy construction and resources customers are slow to return. An investor must have an optimistic view towards 5+ years of strong real GDP growth as well as sustained inflation. If one lowers the growth assumption to a more likely outcome, then the implicit bet is that low to negative real interest rates will persist and the forward P/E multiple will stay elevated4. I do not want to make such a strong macro bet as the justification for owning a stock. Fastenal is a cyclical business with a growth model proven to take market share secularly, but the time to buy FAST (the stock) will be when we are in the depths of an industrial recession. Stay tuned.”9. Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33  Dividend Yield as of October 13: 2.83%Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) provides atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, equipment, and services worldwide. It is one of the top industrial stocks to invest in. Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

(NYSE:APD), with 498,408 shares worth more than $119.9 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Madison Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“This quarter we are highlighting Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) as a relative yield example in the Materials sector. APD is a leading global industrial gas supply company and is the largest supplier of hydrogen and helium in the world. It has a sustainable competitive advantage due to long-term customer relationships and contracts, high customer switching costs, and the mission critical nature of its products. Industrial gases are a relatively small fraction of customers’ overall costs but are crucial to ensure uninterrupted production.Our thesis on APD is that it appears well-positioned for consistent double-digit growth due to a large multi-year capital allocation plan, and the need for accelerating capital expenditures by its customers. It has a $25 billion backlog driven by traditional gas investments along with new growth opportunities like gasification, green hydrogen, and carbon capture. APD’s gasification technologies help improve energy efficiency and independence, which is a key focus for its customers.

300,71c604ba-bbe0-35be-a02b-6ee50fd29a39,GPC,2022-10-14,Genuine Parts (GPC) Earnings Expected to Grow: What to Know Ahead of Next Week's Release,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/genuine-parts-gpc-earnings-expected-140002408.html,1665669602,STORY,['GPC'],"[The market expects Genuine Parts (GPC) to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis auto and industrial parts distributor is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.03 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +8%.Revenues are expected to be $5.39 billion, up 11.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Genuine Parts?For Genuine Parts, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.82%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Genuine Parts will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Genuine Parts would post earnings of $2.02 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.20, delivering a surprise of +8.91%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Genuine Parts appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35 Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) manufactures and sells motion and control technologies and systems for various mobile, industrial, and aerospace markets worldwide.

Here is what the fund said:“Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), a U.S. company that specializes in motion and control technologies, is suffering from what we believe are investor misunderstandings and misjudgements, despite the efforts of the company’s unusually strong management team. In our opinion, since his promotion in 2015, CEO Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the product portfolio to longer cycled, higher growth, higher margin and higher return end markets. The results are impressive. Margins, returns and earnings have increased substantially. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition in the September quarter, the highly depressed aerospace segment will be its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which—combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses, including clean technologies and factory automation—should accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be similar or better. At a low-teens multiple of next year’s normalized cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.”11. Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36   Cummins Inc.

All other eligible countries, excluding Spain, will see a Nov. 3 launch date with Spain rounding out the rollout on Nov. 10. Pricing will vary depending on the country.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.In terms of the $6.99 price tag in the U.S., Netflix said it's ""not heavily anchoring"" its pricing based on competition (Disney+ with ads will cost $7.99), but rather the entertainment value it can deliver to members.The company also shrugged off concerns about consumers trading down to the ad tier, surmising that total revenue will be neutral to positive with the comparable plan.""We're not trying to steer people to one plan or the other,"" Netflix COO Greg Peters said on a call prior to the announcement. ""We think the revenue model will be fine as a result.""'Everything people love about Netflix'Netflix is currently utilizing a fixed price model for advertisers (it would not reveal its cost-per-thousand rate), but said it's open to adjusting that model in the future.According to Netflix Worldwide Advertising President Jeremi Gorman, the platform ""nearly sold out all of its [ad] inventory"" globally for launch.""Basic with Ads"" will feature an average of 4 to 5 minutes of ads per hour with tight frequency caps so members won't see the same ads repeatedly. At launch, ads will run 15 or 30 seconds in length, with some running prior to the start of a program while others will be mid-roll ads.Story continues""In the grand scheme of things, it's a very pro-consumer approach,"" Peters said, emphasizing that the ad experience was ""thoughtfully"" created.""Bridgerton"" season 2 (Courtesy: Netflix)Netflix is currently utilizing a fixed price model for advertisers (it would not reveal its cost-per-thousand rate), but said it's open to adjusting that model in the future.Netflix revealed that a limited number of movies and TV shows won't be available for users in the ad tier due to licensing restrictions, estimating that about 5% to 10% of overall programming won't be available depending on the country. The platform said it will look to reduce that number over time.In addition, users will not be able to download titles due to ""technical complexities.""""In short, Basic with Ads is everything people love about Netflix, at a lower price, with a few ads in-between,"" the company said in a blog post, crediting its partnership with Microsoft (MSFT) for the ad tier's quick 6-month turnover. Microsoft generated $10 billion in advertising sales last year, and was announced as the streamer's technology and sales partner in July.The company said it will offer broad targeting capabilities by country and genre, while advertisers will have the ability to prevent their ads from appearing on content that might be inconsistent with their brand (i.e. sex, nudity, or graphic violence.)Additionally, Netflix plans to lean on Nielsen's Digital Ad Ratings in the U.S. to help advertisers better understand how the platform can reach their target audience. It will become available some time in 2023.The answer to Netflix's problems?Wall Street is fairly optimistic that the ad tier could be the answer to Netflix's myriad of problems.Earlier this week, JPMorgan Analyst Doug Anmuth estimated that Netflix could drive 7.5 million subscribers to its ad tier in the U.S. and Canada in 2023, leading to $600 million in advertising sales.By 2026, Anmuth anticipated that Netflix's U.S. and Canada segment will boast 22 million subscribers and drive $2.65 billion in advertising sales.Yet while Netflix has enjoyed quite a few Wall Street upgrades in recent weeks as a direct result of the upcoming rollout, shares of the streaming giant are still down 63% so far in 2022.Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Food Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Reliability is defined using industry-standard metrics to determine how often customers experience power outages and how long power outages last when they do occur.Overall reliability for the first nine months of 2022 was 82 percent better than when ComEd began smart grid improvements in 2011. Since these investments began, ComEd and its more than 6,200 employees have helped customers avoid more than 18.8 million outages, saving more than $3 billion in outage-related costs. More than 3.6 million of ComEd’s more than 4 million customers have experienced, on average, less than one outage so far in 2022.""It wasn’t that long ago that most ComEd customers expected power outages and considered them commonplace,"" said ComEd President and COO Terence R. Donnelly. ""Today the story is very different. Our investments in the grid are paying off as ComEd today offers some of the best reliability in the nation, ensuring ComEd customers have reliable and sustainable power when they need it the most.""ComEd continues to deliver tremendous value for customers. In addition to providing industry-leading reliability, ComEd’s rates today are among the most competitive in the nation: Average residential rates are 21 percent lower than the top 10 U.S. metro areas, and average commercial rates are 13 percent lower than the top 20 U.S. metro areas. As a percentage of residents' median income, ComEd's residential electricity cost is nearly the lowest in the country.ComEd’s reliable and resilient service also are helping to boost new investment and jobs for the region. Last year alone, ComEd helped launch 16 new commercial projects with commitments to invest $3 billion locally and create 4,700 new jobs. As a testament to companies’ confidence in ComEd’s reliable infrastructure, 2022 is on pace to deliver a significant level of regional investment, with major growth driven by data center, manufacturing, transportation and logistics industries, among others.Story continuesComEd’s top performance on reliability was further underscored when it was recently recognized as a top 20 energy company by Site Selection magazine, a comparison with 3,300 utility providers nationally.""Strong infrastructure is an essential component of company location decisions and ComEd’s commitment to reliable energy in Illinois provides an important resource in attracting businesses to the state,"" said Intersect Illinois CEO Dan Seals.""ComEd’s smart grid investments are paying off, with fewer outages, improved storm response time, and enhanced resilience to meet the evolving needs of our communities across northern Illinois,"" said Palos Park Mayor John F.

The bank’s earnings and revenues are expected to have improved from the year-ago reported figure.M&amp;T Bank met the consensus mark in the prior quarter. A rise in net interest income (NII) and the net interest margin (NIM) were tailwinds. However, increased expenses were the key undermining factors.M&amp;T Bank has a decent earnings surprise history, having surpassed estimates in three of the last four quarters and meeting in the other. The company has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.50%, on average.M&amp;T Bank Corporation Price and EPS Surprise M&amp;T Bank Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseM&amp;T Bank Corporation price-eps-surprise | M&amp;T Bank Corporation QuoteKey Factors to NoteNII: While lending activity improved sequentially in the third quarter, the pace of loan growth across most categories slowed as the quarter progressed. Per the Fed’s latest data, commercial and industrial loans, real estate loans, and consumer loans slightly moderated in July and August from the second quarter. Encouragingly, commercial real estate loan growth accelerated in the quarter under review.Given M&amp;T Bank’s substantial exposure to commercial and commercial real estate loans, the company is likely to have seen a decent acceleration in loan balances.Also, M&amp;T Bankoperates as a solid and sustainable regional bank franchise, with a footprint spanning six Mid-Atlantic States. Substantial geographic coverage and the past acquisition of People’s United are likely to have been tailwinds for lending activities.However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter average interest-earning assets of $185.6 billion suggests a 2.2% fall from the prior quarter’s reported number.Decent lending aside, higher interest rates are expected to have supported MTB’s NII. In the third quarter, the Fed hiked interest rates by 150 basis points. With this, the level of the policy rate reached 3.0-3.25%, the highest since 2008.This is likely to have driven MTB’s asset yield and NII.Story continuesNII is estimated to be $1.73 billion, indicating a 22.7% jump from the prior quarter’s reported figure.Fee Income: While muted equity market performance in the to-be-reported quarter is expected to have been a headwind for trust income, new business and recapture of money market fee waivers are expected to have buoyed the same. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $191 million for trust income implies a marginal sequential rise.The company is expected to see lower service charges on deposits, reflecting the past implementation of overdraft policy changes and fee waivers, along with a likely runoff in deposits. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for service charges on deposits of $118 million suggests a 4.8% decline from the prior quarter’s reported level.Residential mortgage production continued to reduce in the third quarter, as mortgage rates increased sequentially and exceeded the 6% mark in September. Also, moderation in residential refinancing activity due to the rise in rates is expected to have weighed on mortgage banking income. Also, as the company is anticipated to have retained its mortgage originations in the quarter, minimal gain on sale income is expected to have been witnessed. Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same of $97 million suggests a rise of 16.9% from the prior quarter’s reported level.Expenses:  Given M&amp;T bank’s ongoing investments in several areas, including operational infrastructure and technology, we expect the company’s expense base to have been under pressure in the third quarter.

(NASDAQ:AKAM) Shares Could Be 50% Below Their Intrinsic Value Estimate",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/akamai-technologies-inc-nasdaq-akam-103031445.html,1665743431,STORY,['AKAM'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAM) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Akamai Technologies What's The Estimated Valuation?We are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$877.9mUS$1.03bUS$1.14bUS$1.28bUS$1.37bUS$1.46bUS$1.53bUS$1.59bUS$1.64bUS$1.69bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x5Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 7.68%Est @ 5.97%Est @ 4.77%Est @ 3.94%Est @ 3.35%Est @ 2.94% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$819US$899US$927US$965US$969US$958US$936US$907US$874US$839(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$9.1bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.7b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.0%) = US$33bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$33b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$16bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$25b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$80.5, the company appears quite undervalued at a 50% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Akamai Technologies as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.122. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Akamai Technologies, we've compiled three relevant factors you should look at:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Akamai Technologies   you should know about.Future Earnings: How does AKAM's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

To skip our detailed analysis of the global economic outlook and the content delivery network sector, go directly and see 5 Best Content Delivery Network Stocks To Buy Now.Content delivery network (CDN) stocks offer a worthwhile investment opportunity to investors. A CDN is a geographically distributed network of proxy servers and their respective data centers. CDNs sprung up in the late 1990s as means to optimize traffic flow and enhance the distribution of content through bottlenecks on the Internet.The CDN market is a branch of the wider global consumer electronics market. According to a recent market analysis report, the global CDN market growth is expected to accelerate at a CAGR of 26.84% from 2022 to 2026. The size of the CDN market is expected to achieve incremental growth by nearly $51.3 billion. The market is highly diverse and fragmented with multiple players occupying the competitive landscape. The fact that the CDN market is expected to grow 24.57% in 2022 whilst the global economic growth rate has plummeted to 2.2% makes CDN stocks a highly safe and profitable bet for investors who are reeling from losses brought about by the severe economic crisis.The growth of the CDN market can be attributed to the recent rise in server availability post the 2020 pandemic. CDNs are able to utilize servers and distribute content accordingly, thereby networking traffic to these servers. CDN solutions have taken firm footing during the pandemic, with multiple organizations using CDNs to increase their digital footprint, and boost traffic on their websites. Content delivery clouds aid in enhancing the delivery service abilities of web applications and facilitate research which improves scalability, robustness of systems, etc. Some of the major players in the CDN sector include Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), AT&amp;T Inc. (NYSE:T), and Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). In this article, we shall look at 11 best content delivery network stocks to buy now.Story continuesPhoto by Taylor Vick on Unsplash   Our MethodologyFor this article, we looked at Insider Monkey's database which tracks 895 elite hedge funds and identified some of the best CDN stocks.

(NYSE:GDDY) in their Q3 2021 investor letter:“GoDaddy (NYSE:GDDY)  in particular sold off after reporting quarterly earnings in early August.

Presently GDDY (NYSE:GDDY) trades at a greater than 5.5 percent trailing FCF yield, and a 7.2 percent 2021 yield based on my own (lower than consensus) estimation. Deferred revenue continues to improve. CEO Aman Bhutani and team have done an excellent job rebranding the company.

The company's resilience was put on display when it achieved remarkable revenue growth in 2022 despite elongated sales cycles amongst larger customers. Security is the central revenue stream for Cloudflare Inc. (NYSE:NET), and with security budgets less likely to get cut in the event of a downturn, the company is more or less recession-proof. Furthermore, Cloudflare's (NYSE:NET) large customer base is increasing exponentially, representing nearly 59% of the total revenue in Q2 2022, compared to 46% in 2020.Here is what Baron Funds had to say about Cloudflare Inc. (NYSE:NET) in their Q2 2022 investor letter:“Despite posting solid quarterly results with 54% revenue growth, and a record addition of 14,000 customers, shares of Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET), a software infrastructure provider, declined 63% in the quarter along with other fast-growing names in the software universe that penalize current profitability by reinvesting back in their businesses. We believe Cloudflare’s (NYSE:NET) disruptive global platform and unmatched pace of innovation will enable the company to continue to take share across multiple large addressable markets for years to come.”   Click here to continue reading and see 5 Best Content Delivery Network Stocks To Buy Now.     Suggested Articles:Best Casino Stocks To BuyBest Chemical Stocks To BuyTop 10 Data Center Companies In the US Disclosure: none. 11 Best Content Delivery Network Stocks To Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
316,b668cca2-d8c7-3846-b066-04cfca42e9b6,HP,2022-10-14,Here's Why Helmerich & Payne (HP) Could be Great Choice for a Bottom Fisher,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-helmerich-payne-hp-135501519.html,1665669301,STORY,['HP'],"[A downtrend has been apparent in Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP) lately. While the stock has lost 11.2% over the past four weeks, it could witness a trend reversal as a hammer chart pattern was formed in its last trading session. This could mean that the bulls have been able to counteract the bears to help the stock find support.The formation of a hammer pattern is considered a technical indication of nearing a bottom with likely subsiding of selling pressure. But this is not the only factor that makes a bullish case for the stock. On the fundamental side, strong agreement among Wall Street analysts in raising earnings estimates for this oil and gas well-drilling contractor enhances its prospects of a trend reversal.1-month candlestick chart for HPWhat is a Hammer Chart and How to Trade It?This is one of the popular price patterns in candlestick charting. A minor difference between the opening and closing prices forms a small candle body, and a higher difference between the low of the day and the open or close forms a long lower wick (or vertical line). The length of the lower wick being at least twice the length of the real body, the candle resembles a 'hammer.'In simple terms, during a downtrend, with bears having absolute control, a stock usually opens lower compared to the previous day's close, and again closes lower. On the day the hammer pattern is formed, maintaining the downtrend, the stock makes a new low. However, after eventually finding support at the low of the day, some amount of buying interest emerges, pushing the stock up to close the session near or slightly above its opening price.When it occurs at the bottom of a downtrend, this pattern signals that the bears might have lost control over the price. And, the success of bulls in stopping the price from falling further indicates a potential trend reversal.Hammer candles can occur on any timeframe -- such as one-minute, daily, weekly -- and are utilized by both short-term as well as long-term investors.Story continuesLike every technical indicator, the hammer chart pattern has its limitations. Particularly, as the strength of a hammer depends on its placement on the chart, it should always be used in conjunction with other bullish indicators.Here's What Makes the Trend Reversal More Likely for HPThere has been an upward trend in earnings estimate revisions for HP lately, which can certainly be considered a bullish indicator on the fundamental side. That's because a positive trend in earnings estimate revisions usually translates into price appreciation in the near term.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for the current year has increased 6.8%. What it means is that the sell-side analysts covering HP are majorly in agreement that the company will report better earnings than they predicted earlier.If this is not enough, you should note that HP currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), which means it is in the top 20% of more than the 4,000 stocks that we rank based on trends in earnings estimate revisions and EPS surprises. And stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 usually outperform the market. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Moreover, a Zacks Rank of 2 for Helmerich &amp; Payne is a more conclusive indication of a potential trend reversal, as the Zacks Rank has proven to be an excellent timing indicator that helps investors identify precisely when a company's prospects are beginning to improve.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE: PRU).This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221013005380/en/Shehriyar Antia Head of Thematic Research, PGIM (Photo: Business Wire)In ""The New Dynamics of Private Markets,"" the latest in PGIM’s Megatrends research series, PGIM finds that tightening monetary conditions and a slowing economy will challenge investors to navigate the increasingly blurred lines between private and public assets, address liquidity concerns and explore newer segments of private credit markets. The paper draws on insights from more than 40 investment professionals across PGIM’s private alternatives, real estate, fixed income and equity managers — as well as over a dozen leading academics, investors and sell-side researchers.""With the rising possibility of hard landings in the U.S., Europe and emerging markets, this will be the first test since the global financial crisis of whether nonbank financial institutions have diversified risk and brought better market judgment, or created new, hidden concentrations of risks,"" said Shehriyar Antia, head of thematic research, PGIM.WINNERS WILL BE TESTEDNew private credit entrants need to prove their mettle in a downturnAs banks and finance companies have withdrawn from riskier segments of lending, direct lending from private credit funds has boomed from less than $10 billion in 2006 to over $400 billion in 2021. However, many newer entrants into private markets haven’t been tested across a credit cycle and may not have the workout and recovery skills of more experienced firms.Story continuesAI-powered fintech platforms and short-term credit providers face uncertaintyThe last decade has seen a surge of fintech lending platforms that offer unsecured loans to individuals and small businesses, then securitize these loans into asset-backed securities. However, credit losses and charge-offs on buy-now, pay-later loans have already translated into higher funding costs for some ABS issuers, leading to concerns about the viability of the business model.Direct lending needs to dig deeper for attractive investment opportunitiesPrivate equity, sponsor-backed lending now comprises more than 70% of the direct lending universe. However, most of that is concentrated in larger deals, where capital is ample and competition is fierce. Direct lenders who build relationships with middle-market business owners and carry out bespoke underwriting can create potentially attractive debt solutions in areas where capital is more scarce.KEY CONSIDERATIONS FOR INVESTORS""While these new dynamics in private markets will be complex to navigate, they offer a range of attractive opportunities for long-term, sophisticated investors to evaluate,"" said Taimur Hyat, chief operating officer, PGIM. ""Investors should look carefully at liquidity, secondary markets and private equity sponsor behavior as they navigate these turbulent times.""Evaluate more flexible investment approaches that span public and private marketsA credit risk approach that looks at private credit separately from public is no longer suitable due to the growing overlap and interplay between the two segments. Portions of the same underlying corporate loan can find a home in syndications, CLOs or even private debt funds. No matter the structure, the growing fungibility of the underlying credit means there may be less diversification benefit from allocating separately to public and private debt.Develop a more sophisticated understanding of liquidityAs chief investment officers add to their private allocations — for example, U.S. pensions have doubled their allocation to private markets over the past 10 years — many are seeking a deeper understanding of the overall liquidity profile of their portfolio. Secondary markets — which provide liquidity to private market investors — may be a vital portfolio management tool, especially for investors bound by strict allocation targets.Closely watch maturing new debt asset classes for attractive risk-return opportunitiesNewer segments of private credit markets may offer greater opportunities for return in a challenging macro environment. Infrastructure debt remains a growing but relatively underappreciated asset class — especially with the potential for earnings stresses around the corner and bubbles in overheated private equity markets.Evaluate integrating private alternatives into defined contribution plans where appropriateMost DC plan participants have a long-term investment horizon that aligns well with the lower liquidity and committed capital structure of private markets. Chief investment officers with oversight over defined benefit and DC plans in countries such as the U.S., U.K. and Australia should carefully weigh the opportunities for responsibly incorporating private market investments into DC plans, just as they have in their defined benefit plans.""Employers’ defined contribution plans are a great opportunity to democratize private markets investing, allowing individual investors to access the returns available in private assets,"" Hyat said. ""Private real estate is already available in some plans through target date funds and can provide growth opportunities for younger investors, as well as inflation-hedging and income for those approaching or already in retirement.""To learn more, read ""The New Dynamics of Private Markets"" and visit PGIM’s Megatrends 360 for investment insights categorized across asset classes, themes and regions.ABOUT PGIMPGIM is the global asset management business of Prudential Financial, Inc.

In the column below, I will provide you with information about seven undervalued value stocks that investors should buy now. I used multiple criteria, including financial results, price-earnings ratios, and analysts’ price targets to determine which stocks are in the latter category.Investors can contrast value stocks with growth stocks which often appear overpriced relative to their fundamentals.  Value stocks have come into their own in 2022 because this year has been particularly brutal on growth stocks. As the Fed raises interest rates, the cost of borrowing increases. That makes growth firms, which often have a great deal of debt, particularly risky. That is why capital has flown out of tech and other growth equities and into value stocks. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDespite that trend, there are still plenty of undervalued value stocks for investors to buy.BMYBristol Myers Squibb$68.50DALDelta$29.39PFEPfizer$41.80VLOValero$111PFEPfizer$41.80PGProcter &amp; Gamble$124XOMExxon Mobil$99Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY)Bristol-Myers (BMY) logo at the top of a cellphone.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comI’d argue that Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) stock is significantly undervalued due to multiple factors. Bristol Myers Squibb is, first of all, quite profitable. Specifically, the pharmaceutical company boasts a gross margin above 79%. That is higher than all but 8% of the more than 1,000 pharma firms in its peer group. Investors who recognize that analysts’ average price target for BMY stock is roughly 15% above the stock’s current level can start to understand why many see it as a strong value pick. There is some irony in the fact that BMY stock remains underpriced because it has bested analysts’ average earnings expectations in each of the last four quarters for which it has posted results. And for the second quarter, it posted earnings per share of $1.93, versus analysts’ average estimate of $1.70. Story continuesThe company’s performance has been greatly enhanced by multiple drugs that generate at least $1 billion of revenue annually, including Eliquis, Opdivo, and Revlimid. In Q2, the three therapeutics collectively contributed $7.8 billion of Bristol Myers Squibb’s $11.9 billion of sales. Pharmaceutical companies generally rely on one or more lucrative treatments to fund their research and development. That R&amp;D, in turn, fuels their future success. Bristol Myers Squibb clearly has very profitable drugs. Therefore, it is well- positioned for continued success. Delta (DAL)Delta (DAL) airlines plane mid take-offSource: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.comDelta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is emerging from a pandemic that dealt the Atlanta-based firm heavy losses. It is also among the largest airlines in the world as measured by fleet size and travelers served. Its size caused it to report massive losses during the pandemic as its fleet sat idle. Consequently, it  racked up a great deal of debt. At the end of Q2, the airlines had $19.6 billion of debt. But Delta continues to pay down its debt and plans to reduce the figure to only $15 billion by 2024. Now the pandemic is essentially over, travel has rebounded, and Delta is through the worst of it. Investors need not worry that the company will be irreparably broken as it was during the pandemic. But the market continues to undervalue DAL stock, which currently trades around $30. Analysts’ average price target for DAL stock is $48. That’s roughly 60% above the stock’s current level. Analysts’ price targets are based on their estimates of where price targets will be in 12 months to 18 months. Valero (VLO)the gas pumps at a Valero gas stationSource: JustPixs / Shutterstock.comValero (NYSE:VLO) stock is sitting in a fortuitous position currently. With OPEC recently announcing that it intends to slash oil production by more than 2 million barrels per day, prices at the pump are set to rise. While that results in higher costs at the pump for you and me, it benefits Valero, the world’s largest independent refiner. Refiners tend to benefit less than exploration firms when prices rise. That’s because  exploration firms sell oil directly from their fields or offshore deposits, while refiners have to buy oil first and then covert it into gasoline or other products. However, Valero’s strong financial performance  in the first half of 2022, when oil prices were high, shows that it benefits from elevated petroleum prices.So it’s evident that Valero has positive catalysts as OPEC reduces oil supplies. But Valero isn’t undervalued based on the notion that gas prices should rise soon. Rather, a combination of other factors, including Valero’s relatively low P/E ratio of 6.87, convinces me that VLO stock is being underestimated. More than 60% of the firms in the oil and gas industry carries a higher P/E ratio than VLO, making Valero attractive. Valero has had a very strong 2022, like so much of the oil and gas industry. With prices at the pump dropping sharply beginning in mid-June, it looked like the party may have been over. That doesn’t look to be the case as OPEC’s latest move roils the space’s supply-demand dynamics.Pfizer (PFE)Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comThe stock market is full of contradictions. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock’s performance this year fairly exemplifies its fickle nature. PFE shares have shed 29% of their value in 2022. That’s not very exceptional, and it is in line with the stock market’s performance.  But at the same time, it’s odd that so many investors have sold Pfizer’s shares. Pfizer’s financial results have been very strong in 2022.In fact, its revenues have increased by 60% YOY and 47% YOY in the first half of the year and Q2, respectively. It’s almost as if the market believes that Pfizer has lost its shine because the pandemic is winding down. But here’s the thing: Pfizer is expected to generate $54.5 billion of revenue from its Covid-19 drugs in 2022, up from $36.7 billion in 2021. The irony is that, based on P/E ratios, PFE stock is cheaper than 85% of all pharmaceutical stocks. All in all, Pfizer is one of the most undervalued value stocks in the pharmaceutical industry. Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)A Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) distribution center in Vandalia.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) stock has fallen to a new 2022 low. The Cincinnati-based consumer goods giant has garnered a lot of press in 2022 as rising recession fears have given defensive stocks, including PG, a boost. Even Procter &amp; Gamble’s shares have fallen, though, as the Fed continues to take a hawkish position on inflation. Many on the Street believe this approach could cause something within the economy “to break,” inadvertently triggering a recession. Whether that happens or not, lean times are clearly here. And that means PG stock is a strong choice. Procter &amp; Gamble sells so-called consumer staples that consumers can’t go without. These are the items like tissues, toilet paper, toothpaste, razors, and deodorant for which there is relatively even demand no matter what the economy is doing. Consider the company’s history of creating value as measured by a return on invested capital of 13.48% that far outpaces its weighted average cost of capital, at 4.74%. Combine that with its dividend that hasn’t been reduced since 1957, and PG shares look deeply undervalued right now. Boeing (BA)Boeing (BA) passenger airplane with open exit door, passenger windows, cargo door, close up view of Boeing logoSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock.comBoeing (NYSE:BA) stock is in deep value territory. That value is evidenced by its price-sales ratio which is close to a two-year low and lower than three-fifths of the companies in the aerospace and defense industry. It isn’t hard to understand why when you consider everything that has happened to the firm over the last few years. The company produces aircraft that it sells in similar quantities.to the commercial sector and militaries. Most recently, Boeing reported just over $6 billion of sales for Q2. But the company is still reeling from the pandemic which caused its sales to grind to a halt as airlines’ fleets were grounded worldwide. And two of Boeing’s 737 Max planes crashed, leading to safety probes, fraud charges, and a $200 million settlement. Boeing has resumed deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner after a long delay. That development should boost the firm moving forward.The bullish case for Boeing is relatively straightforward: It is one of only two major airplane manufacturers in the world. For the most part, investors simply have to buy its shares now and wait for the current macroeconomic issues to ease over time. Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate buildingSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.comExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock is seriously undervalued for similar reasons that Valero’s shares are undervalued. That is, OPEC’s recent decision to cut its production by 2 million barrels per day should directly benefit Exxon Mobil’s chances moving forward. Q2 was exceptionally positive for Exxon Mobil as it posted profits of $17.9 billion, drastically higher than the $4.69 billion of earnings that it reported during the same period a year prior. But market conditions changed at the tail end of Q2 as oil prices began to steadily decline. Now that OPEC is curbing its production, oil prices appear likely to rise again. On the one hand, XOM stock isn’t very far from being fully priced currently, as it trades slightly below  analysts’ average price target of $107. I believe the shares could exceed $130 as investors search for real returns i.e. profits over and above inflation, in the increasingly tough market. XOM’s dividend yields 3.5% so the stock’s returns aren’t dependent on the upward movement of its stock price alone. XOM stock is also undervalued based on its strong return on equity (ROE) which is better than 75% of the competitors in its sector. ROE measures how effectively a firm turns equity capital into profits. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The model, popularized by Snowflake Inc., is being adopted by a growing number of software makers, including C3.ai Inc. and Autodesk Inc.Analysts have traditionally viewed pay-as-you-go as a liability for providers, figuring that customers can more quickly dial back spending when times get rough. But in the current market slowdown, consumption-model cheerleader Snowflake said it continues to attract new clients to its data storage and analytics products who want to pay just for what they need when money is tight rather than being locked into a big contract. Subscription-model stalwarts like Salesforce Inc. and ServiceNow Inc. by contrast have reported a slowdown in acquiring new business.The slowing sales cycles helped push C3.ai, an enterprise software provider led by industry veteran Tom Siebel, to switch all new business to consumption pricing. Signing up new customers is much easier now that initial purchase is cheaper and requires less executive approval, Siebel said. “In a recession, you need to talk about pennies not millions.”Siebel, who sold his eponymous customer relationship management company to Oracle Corp. in 2006, said the pricing transition will flatten revenue in the short term before accelerating growth. Last month, Mike Cikos, an analyst at Needham &amp; Co., said it’s a challenge for companies to change the way they sell their products, and C3.ai’s shares are “likely to stay in limbo until we have line of sight to the other side of the transition.”Story continuesCloud-computing providers like Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Alphabet Inc. have long charged customers based on how much server space is used, but this pricing model has expanded to more kinds of software services, according to a 2021 report by venture capital firm OpenView Partners. More than half of software companies said they expect to use consumption pricing by 2023, according to a survey it conducted. Other notable examples include customer communication provider Twilio Inc. and OpenAI’s image generator Dall-E.Software stocks have been battered this year as traders bet on increasingly aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve. The iShares expanded software ETF is down 38% this year compared with 214% drop in the broad-based S&amp;P 500. Unprofitability, long accepted in high-growth firms, has been a particular black mark on software companies like Snowflake this year, with a basket of money-losing tech companies compiled by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. down 59%. In this economic backdrop, its unsurprising tech leaders are willing to try new pricing strategies to keep growth going.Not every executive is convinced. Atlassian Corp. Co-CEO Mike Cannon-Brookes said the pricing model makes less sense for collaborative applications, particularly when there’s not a specific resource like server space being consumed. Customers expect a simple per-user subscription cost for workplace tools that are a part of the typical business day like Atlassian’s Trello, Cannon-Brookes said. “I don’t feel demand to move away from it.”Consumption pricing doesn’t work as well when users are discouraged from using the service by continually climbing costs -- also known as the “taxi-meter effect” -- according to the OpenView report. They pointed toward Adecco Group AG’s platform Hired.com, where recruiters posted fewer job listings when pricing was pay-per-hire. Customers may also be put off by high cost variability and prefer a more simplified buying experience, according to the OpenView researchers.Snowflake bills sometimes also have surprised customers. Numerous social media posts share stories of high charges from the company or trade tips on keeping costs down. Earlier this year, Snowflake executives said improvements to its products would lower customer expenses.Usage-based pricing is less common in applications than infrastructure, but that may be changing. Autodesk, known for its architectural and manufacturing design programs, last year introduced one-day “Flex” licenses. Under this plan, AutoCAD -- one of its flagship applications -- costs $21 for each day of use compared with a standard $235-a-month subscription plan. Chief Executive Officer Andrew Anagnost said about 40% of the users of the flex pricing model are new.“It’s a powerful tool for small businesses that can’t afford a full subscription to everything we do,” Anagnost said. “I think eventually, most everyone’s going to end up in some kind of consumption plan.”Snowflake Chief Revenue Officer Chris Degnan started as the company’s first salesperson in 2013, and remembers it was “not easy” to sell the consumption-based product to companies that had never heard of it. Snowflake even had to build its own billing system, since most payment processors were geared toward handling subscriptions.Today, Snowflake looks like the elder statesman of pay-for-what-you-use pricing. Degnan said he gets many executives calling him to ask about switching their companies to Snowflake’s model.“There are going to be software-as-a-service companies that don’t make that transition that will fail,” Degnan said.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMark Zuckerberg Isn’t Saying Much About Facebook These DaysUkrainians Return Home by the Millions Even as War Rages OnHow Gamers Beat NFTsA Digital Drive to Reform the $11 Trillion Global Gold MarketJohn Mack, Who Led Morgan Stanley Into a Crisis, Regrets Little©2022 Bloomberg L.P.]"

Ines, more gloom for the chip sector under a lot of pressure already.INES FERRE: Yeah, that's right. And if we look at the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index, I mean, right now, it's rebounding. But it had opened lower. It was down as much as 4% earlier today. And a four-day chart will show you that it's down 5%, and a year to date chart shows it is down 43%.But let's get to that chip sector that you were just mentioning. And TSMC, that it beat on the top and the bottom line, cutting capital spending and also warning about slowing consumer demand. So moving into the fourth quarter, TSMC warning that it's seeing demand flattish. Right now, it's rebounding. The stock is up 7%.But I also just want to mention that, look, the chip sector has been dealing with the fallout of the new government regulations, the Biden administration's export controls. So you've got Applied Materials, Lam Research, Applied Materials saying that their fourth quarter is going to be impacted by this new regulation. So you've got this regulation on the one hand, and then you've got some of these chip makers that are talking about slowing consumer demand, on the other hand, impacting.And keep in mind that the chip sector also is going through periodic cycles. So it was expected that in the second half of the year, that we would see demand slowed down, slower. And it's-- these stocks are such that they've kind of been the way the pandemic style stocks have been-- really high during the pandemic and then losing steam this year. Jared.JARED BLIKRE: Hey, we don't need any nuance on that. We know the hit that they've been taking, and a lot of green on that board. It was red quite a bit earlier.

HAS is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Oct 18, before the opening bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 30.7%.How Are Estimates Placed?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.60 per share, indicating a decline of 18.4% from the $1.96 reported in the year-ago quarter.For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at nearly $1.68 billion, suggesting a decline of 15% from the prior-year quarter’s figure.Let’s analyze the factors that are likely to make an impact this earnings season.Factors to NoteHasbro’s third-quarter results are likely to have been negatively impacted by high costs and supply chain disruptions. Earlier, the company said that it expects inflationary pressure to persist for the majority of 2022.Moreover, dismal Entertainment, Gaming, Franchise as well as Partner brands revenues are likely to have hurt the top line. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Franchise Brands and Partner Brands is pegged at $868 million and $321 million, indicating a decline of 1.6% and 12.5%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for Entertainment revenues is pegged at $240 million, indicating a decline of 36.3% year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Emerging Brands revenues is pegged at $125 million, down 29.8% year over year.However, increased focus on multigenerational fan engagement through omni-media play and entertainment offerings bode well. The company has a vast gaming portfolio and it has been refining gaming experiences across a multitude of platforms including face-to-face gaming, off-the-board gaming and digital gaming experiences on mobile. This, along with the expansion of online offerings, might have driven the third-quarter performance.Hasbro, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise  Hasbro, Inc.

Since the plan came online on Jan 1, 2021, it amassed over 40 employers providing retirement benefits to more than 30,000 workers.AON roped in employers from a diverse mix of industries that incorporate biotech and life sciences, consumer products, energy, manufacturing, services, technology and transportation. The PEP is marked as an efficient program as it reduces employers’ 401(k) costs and workload. It enables workers to accumulate close to 11% more retirement savings, thanks to its lower fee structure than the traditional benefit programs.Aon expects that by 2030, over 50% of U.S. employers will merge their plans into pooled employer plans. This can result in a growing demand for AON’s PEP. It is expected to reduce participant costs for employers, which can be diverted toward enriching retirement security for the employees. Further, AON plans to provide the same benefits to nonprofits in the United States. As such, it urges Congress to allow the 403(b) plan sponsors to join pooled employer plans.This highlights AON’s ability to create products according to the needs of the clients and markets, rapidly expanding its business. Its large product portfolio and presence in different geographies enable the company to diversify its revenue sources. The company expects a mid-single-digit or greater organic revenue growth, margin improvement and double-digit free cash flow growth in 2022 and beyond.However, despite implementing multiple cost control measures, the company's operating expenses are on the rise, which can put a dent in its profits. Also, it has been facing an unfavorable impact of forex volatility on its bottom line.Price PerformanceAON’s shares have declined 9% in the past year compared with the 10.3% fall of the industry.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksAON currently has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Story continuesSome better-ranked stocks in the broader finance space are Brown &amp; Brown, Inc.

But, sometimes, they need your help. Kraft launching a website and a call to action. Whereisthemac.com encourages the public to push McDonald's to add Kraft Mac and Cheese to the Big Mac. The site has a direct link to tweet at McDonald's with the hashtag where's the Mac. Kraft saying in a statement, quote, ""we believe that the time for change is now.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, McDonald's' earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. View our latest analysis for McDonald's peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on McDonald's.What Are Growth Metrics Telling Us About The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like McDonald's' to be considered reasonable.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 12%. This has soured the latest three-year period, which nevertheless managed to deliver a decent 7.5% overall rise in EPS. Although it's been a bumpy ride, it's still fair to say the earnings growth recently has been mostly respectable for the company.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 13% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. That's shaping up to be materially higher than the 9.5% per annum growth forecast for the broader market.In light of this, it's understandable that McDonald's' P/E sits above the majority of other companies. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.What We Can Learn From McDonald's' P/E?We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Story continuesWe've established that McDonald's maintains its high P/E on the strength of its forecast growth being higher than the wider market, as expected. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Plus, you should also learn about these   2 warning signs we've spotted with McDonald's.Of course, you might also be able to find a better stock than McDonald's.

(NYSE:PLD) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Prologis The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PrologisOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Co-Founder, Hamid Moghadam, for US$46m worth of shares, at about US$145 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$103). So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Prologis shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Prologis better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Does Prologis Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that Prologis insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$100m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Prologis Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. Our analysis of Prologis insider transactions leaves us cautious. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Prologis you should be aware of, and 1 of them is significant.Of course Prologis may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

United Parcel Service (UPS), which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Air Freight and Cargo industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this package delivery service has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 5.52%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, UPS came out with earnings of $3.29 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.14 per share, representing a surprise of 4.78%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $2.87 per share and it actually produced earnings of $3.05 per share, delivering a surprise of 6.27%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor UPS, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.UPS currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.60%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on October 25, 2022.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

It also raised its adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year. Importantly, CVS increased its cash flow from the operations guidance range. This gives it the option to hike its dividend of $2.20 a share, or 2.21% annually. Alternatively, it could pay down its debt or buy back more shares.CVS stock could trade at new highs if it returned capital to loyal shareholders. Instead, the company is determined to fuel its growth by acquiring companies. The strategy works if it is buying deeply discounted targets. Until asset values for targets fall, CVS investors deserve a higher dividend instead.In 2023, CVS will have capital expenditure levels similar to that of this year. In addition, it will have similar cash flow levels. Markets would likely bid the stock higher if CVS built its cash levels on hand.

When inflation rates ease in Europe, Mondelez will post a rebound in margins.Mondelez enjoys a strong moat in the food industry. Consumers cannot live without chocolate. They will allocate some of their grocery budgets to keep buying this affordable indulgence.The company has the flexibility to raise product prices. If input costs rise, it will pass the higher costs to customers. They will willingly pay. Investors should buy MDLZ stock on any pullback.Target (TGT)an image of bullseye the target dog in a target storeSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.comTarget (NYSE:TGT) is a retailer that continues to manage its inventory as demand weakens. Still, category trends changed earlier this year. Customers altered their spending habits but still shop in-store and online at Target.In the back half of the year, Target has multiple seasonal strengths. The winter holiday celebrations will drive sales higher. Investors should watch for Target’s operating margins to hold around 7%. Last year, it posted margins of 6.8%, and 6.5% the year before that.Earlier this year, freight costs and elevated fuel prices hurt Target’s profitability. Today, inventory is likely lower while freight costs are down. Energy prices are not rising as fast as they once did. This will lower the firm’s input costs. It also increases the disposable income of Target’s customers.The supply chain constraint is not likely an ongoing issue. The company’s management team worked through those issues in a short period. This limited the damage to the business making it one of the undervalued high-growth stocks to keep on your radar.United Parcel Service (UPS)Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.Source: monticello / ShutterstockUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) posted a good quarter. Its revenue grew by 4.2% year over year to $24.2 billion in Q3. It expects to achieve an adjusted operating margin of 13.7% this year.UPS stock is a buy because the company will pay dividends worth $5.2 billion. It will also buy back at least $3 billion worth of stock. These actions will limit the downside risks in the stock.UPS will find around $300 million worth of productivity in the back half of the year. As a result, it will improve the delivery firm’s performance efficiencies. By tracking packages effectively and delivering them on or ahead of schedule, UPS will cut overtime hours. This will lower the company’s drive and staff costs.UPS has an appealing service compared to its competitors. For example, it offers a 7-day residential service. It also offers Saturday pickup for its business customers. This resulted in long-term revenue growth and market share expansion.Walmart (WMT)Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is addressing its bloated inventory issues. The strong uptrend in WMT stock since it bottomed in May suggests that shareholders are confident it will not hurt results.Furthermore, profitability expansion is achievable. The company will price its goods to reflect its cost structure.Walmart enjoys a strong brand name that draws customers to its stores. Both Walmart and Sam’s Club are recognized globally. This lowers its risk of relying solely on the U.S. for its strong performance. To strengthen its online presence, Walmart is investing in its e-commerce unit. It takes its digital transformation seriously.Investors should expect Walmart to grow its marketplace, despite the short-term pressures it faces. Fortunately, its online competitors are stumbling. This gives the company a rare chance to take market share.Just as supply chain constraints benefit the companies mentioned, Walmart will also see lower supply chain costs. Expect it to issue strong profit guidance when sales growth outpaces the rise in supply costs.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

344,e4b1333a-63ec-33c3-b414-c03358b70af9,AXP,2022-10-14,American Express (NYSE:AXP) shareholders have earned a 11% CAGR over the last five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-express-nyse-axp-shareholders-120037022.html,1665748837,STORY,['AXP'],"[Stock pickers are generally looking for stocks that will outperform the broader market. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) share price is up 54% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 37% (ignoring dividends).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for American Express In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, American Express achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 9% over the same period. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that American Express has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for American Express the TSR over the last 5 years was 65%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that American Express shares lost 16% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 22%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand American Express better, we need to consider many other factors.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.American Express and Moody's are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that AXP is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.AXP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.83, while MCO has a forward P/E of 25.77. We also note that AXP has a PEG ratio of 1.18. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. MCO currently has a PEG ratio of 2.34.Another notable valuation metric for AXP is its P/B ratio of 4.41. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MCO has a P/B of 17.73.Based on these metrics and many more, AXP holds a Value grade of B, while MCO has a Value grade of F.AXP has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MCO, so it seems like value investors will conclude that AXP is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see some more of the best Dow stocks to buy, go directly to 5 Best Dow Stocks To Buy Now. Dow stocks are stocks listed on the prestigious Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is a stock market index that includes 30 prominent companies. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was created by Charles Dow and Edward Jones in 1896 as a price weighted index to track 30 large companies listed either on the NYSE or NASDAQ. It's considered as a benchmark for blue chips listed in the United States. Due to the Federal Reserve having raised interest rates 5 times this year and expectations that the central bank could increase rates even further, the Dow has dropped almost 20% and there could be more downside in the future if economic data fails to meet expectations. Given that it is comprised mainly of blue chips, the Dow has fallen less year to date than the S&amp;P 500 or the NASDAQ indexes, which have fallen around 25% and 34% respectively. Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to have a well diversified portfolio across many different stocks across many different sectors. Among the blue chip stocks, here are 11 of the best we think long term investors could potentially consider adding to their portfolios.

Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42 Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) is a diversified technology and manufacturing company that makes auxiliary power units, propulsion engines, integrated avionics, and much more. Despite the S&amp;P 500 falling around 25% year to date and the Dow falling almost 20%, Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON) shares have only fallen around 16% year to date due to the company's strong businesses. As of October 12, the company trades at a forward P/E ratio of 18.12 and has an average target price of $204.04 per share. On 10/12/22 Joshua Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanely cut his price target to $187 from $192 and kept an 'equal rating' on Honeywell International Inc. (NYSE:HON). Alongside  The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Honeywell International Inc.

The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 51 The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) is a leading commercial jetliner and military aircraft manufacturer. The company also produces satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems and other products. On 10/12/22, Charles Minnervino of Susquehanna noted that The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)'s delivery data for September showed improvement in 737 MAX deliveries. The analyst reiterated his positive rating and $192 price target. Meridian Funds also said the following about The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in its second quarter investor letter,We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favor The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA), a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.9. Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55 Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) discovers, develops, manufactures, and delivers human therapeutics worldwide. Despite the Dow falling almost 20% year to date, Amgen, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMGN) has rallied 9.1% in 2022 thanks to stronger sentiment.

On 10/12 Kunaal Malde of Atlantic Equities lowered his price target on American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) to $165 from $175 and kept a 'Neutral' rating citing increasing likelihood of a recession for the United States and global economies. ClearBridge Investments mentioned American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) in a second quarter investor letter,“In financials, recession fears outweighed the benefits of rising interest rates; in the Strategy, Bank of America (BAC) and American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) felt these concerns most acutely, although we remain comfortable with these businesses and their strong fundamental positions over the medium-to-long term.”7. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69 Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a leading bank on Wall Street that provides financial services for corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals worldwide. Although Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 20, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis retailer for farmers and ranchers is expected to post quarterly earnings of $2.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +7.2%.Revenues are expected to be $3.28 billion, up 8.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Tractor Supply?For Tractor Supply, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.68%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Tractor Supply will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Tractor Supply would post earnings of $3.53 per share when it actually produced earnings of $3.53, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Tractor Supply appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ACI is likely to register an increase in the top line when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2022 results on Oct 18 before market open. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $17.63 billion, indicating growth of 6.8% from the prior-year reported figure.The bottom line of this food and drug retailer in the United States is expected to decline year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share for the quarter under discussion has risen by a penny to 63 cents over the past seven days. The figure suggests a decline from the earnings of 64 cents from the year-ago period.Albertsons Companies has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 25.7%, on average. In the last reported quarter, this Boise, Idaho-based company surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.1%.Key Factors to NoteAlbertsons Companies' focus on providing efficient in-store services, enhancing digital and omnichannel capabilities and increasing productivity has been contributing to its top line. The company has been enhancing digital payment facilities alongside expanding the availability of online assortments. We expect identical sales to increase 5.2% in the second quarter.  Efforts to bolster assortments, especially in the fresh and Own Brands categories, continue to elevate the customer experience. The company's right assortment in each local market, loyalty programs and the ease of checkout through frictionless and contactless payments have been aiding in attracting customers. As part of its digital endeavors, the company has been expanding the Drive Up &amp; Go curbside pickup service and sharpening home delivery capabilities.The aforementioned factors instill optimism regarding the outcome of the results. However, margins remain an area to watch. The impact of costs associated with digital fulfillment, the supply chain and pandemic-related expenses cannot be ruled out. Product cost inflation and a tight labor market are some of the challenges Albertsons Companies is currently facing. Albertsons Companies, Inc.

But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank is a proven strategy that targets companies with positive earnings estimate revision trends, while our Style Scores work to grade companies based on specific traits.Conagra Brands and Mondelez are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #4 (Sell), respectively, right now. This means that CAG's earnings estimate revision activity has been more impressive, so investors should feel comfortable with its improving analyst outlook. However, value investors will care about much more than just this.Value investors are also interested in a number of tried-and-true valuation metrics that help show when a company is undervalued at its current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.CAG currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.84, while MDLZ has a forward P/E of 19.65. We also note that CAG has a PEG ratio of 2.31. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. MDLZ currently has a PEG ratio of 3.08.Another notable valuation metric for CAG is its P/B ratio of 1.88. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, MDLZ has a P/B of 2.83.Based on these metrics and many more, CAG holds a Value grade of B, while MDLZ has a Value grade of C.CAG has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than MDLZ, so it seems like value investors will conclude that CAG is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

We drive out waste as we drive for excellence.Waste Progress2018201920202021Total waste generated in internal manufacturing sites (metric tonnes)363,050325,955284,554275,203Total food waste generated in internal manufacturing sites (metric tonnes) 1243,258206,934183,576174,083Goal ProgressWe've already exceeding our 2025 goal by reducing food waste in distribution by 65% in 2021 compared to our 2018 baseline (goal 50% reduction). And we've reduced food waste in internal manufacturing sites by 28% (vs. 2018 baselines).Moving From Total Waste to Food Waste in ManufacturingFrom damaging the environment to adding to business costs - waste helps no one. We want to do everything we can to eliminate it as part of our ongoing efforts to contribute to a world where resources are looked after and used with care and in turn, carbon emissions are reduced.Although we will continue to measure, track and strive to minimize all kinds of waste in manufacturing, we've decided to dedicate a greater focus towards food waste. This makes sense for a food company like us, especially considering that a nearly third of all food produced for human consumption is lost or wasted. Beyond that, food loss and waste also amount to a major squandering of resources including water, land, energy, labor and capital, as well as contributing to global GHG emissions.Striving to Eliminate WasteWe believe the best way to tackle waste is to not generate it in the first place. To this end, we set bold goals, developed robust plans and executed the waste reduction agenda with strong governance and discipline. We apply different technologies and approaches to reduce waste, for example, using high speed cameras to analyze processes, improving inspections and maintenance to reduce line stoppages, and developing more efficient changeover processes. And we continue to design processes and lines to avoid waste generation. As a result of our focused and transformational approach, our manufacturing sites and our distribution area have achieved very strong results in waste reduction.Story continues-28% Food waste reduction in internal manufacturing sites (metric tonne vs 2018)-65% Food Waste reduction in Distribution (metric tonne vs 2018)2.7% of total manufacturing waste went to landfill in 2021We achieve these strong results by focusing on zero losses and engagement with colleagues driving responsibility for the identification and eradication of losses.Sending Zero Waste to Landfill in CanadaOur Gladstone site, in Canada, achieved zero waste sent to landfills. The team identified sustainable alternatives to all waste streams, including a waste to energy program. As a result, they were able to send 10 MWh of energy to the grid as well as save more than 50 cubic meters of landfill space.Reducing Waste in AustraliaBy redesigning its Crunchie bar line syrup tanks system to allow for more flexibility, automation and rework consumption, our Ringwood site in Australia succeeded in reducing food waste by 215 tons a year.Engaging Everyone to Drive Down Waste in SwitzerlandAt our Bern site in Switzerland, engaging colleagues in an initiative to drive down waste resulted in 43% less food waste and a 45% reduction in cost compared to 2020. Colleagues used many tools and projects including improving reworks and increasing line reliability.Recovering and Reusing Dust in ThailandReplacing a centralized dust collector with individual collectors at our Khon Kaen site in Thailand enabled the team to recover and reuse the dust - reducing food waste by 10% (36 metric tonnes) compared to 2020.Reworking Scrap in BahrainThe team at our Bahrain site implemented 12 different projects focused on reducing scrap waste. All-in-all, they achieved a 92% reduction in food waste compared to 2020 from the initiatives.Targeting Biscuit Waste in MexicoAt our biscuit factory in Ecatepec, Mexico, the team undertook multiple initiatives to reduce biscuit waste. The result: 400 metric tons less waste.WaterWe are committed to using water responsibly and are focusing our water reduction efforts where we can make a bigger difference.Water Progress2018201920202021Total incoming water (m3) (without borrowed and rainwater, as per our current KPI definition)10,534,51210,362,59410,326,84810,276,279Total incoming water to priority sites (m3) (without borrowed and rainwater, as per our current KPI definition)26,186,9515,995,8095,884,1835,790,894Goal ProgressIn 2021, we achieved a 6.4% reduction in water usage at priority sites in areas where water is most scarce. Usage at these sites is 56% of our total water usage.Having more than met our 2020 goal on water (vs. 2013 baseline), in 2021 we launched our new 2025 goal (vs. 2018 baseline) to reduce absolute water use at priority sites by 10%.Focusing Where Water is Most ScarceGlobal population growth, industrialization, climate change - the world's water is under pressure. We know how important it is to look after this precious resource and we are playing our part by focusing where we can make a bigger difference.We have updated our list of priority sites using the Aqueduct tool from World Resources Institute and changed our water scarcity threshold, which led to an increased number of priority sites: from 27 during the 2013-2020 cycle to 48 during the current 2018-2025 cycle.In 2021, we reduced our absolute water use at priority sites by 6.4% (vs. 2018). Many projects contributed to this result, including our Fallingbostel factory in Germany which optimized its heat exchangers operation and maintenance (60,000 cubic meters (m3) water savings per year), our Borg El Arab factory in Egypt which invested in a treated wastewater recycling system (10,600m3 water savings per year), our Curitiba factory in Brazil which optimized sanitation procedures and also recycled cooling water (nearly 10,000m3 water savings per year) and our East Suzhou factory in China which also implemented a treated wastewater recycling system (8,000m3 water savings per year).Modernizing Wastewater Recycling in ChinaOur team at our East Suzhou site, in China, implemented a modern wastewater recycling system that feeds the cooling towers. It not only reduced wastewater, but also water consumption by 8,000m3.Improving Heat Exchangers to Save Water in GermanyOur Fallingbostel site in Germany has 165 heat exchangers. By improving the maintenance program for these exchangers and implementing a system to detect defects, the team reduced the site's water consumption by 60,000m3 a year.Using Less Water and CO2e in EgyptBy investing in a wastewater recycling system that feeds the boilers, chillers and cooling towers, our Borg El Arab site, in Egypt, reduced not only water consumption but also natural gas and chemicals for water treatment. The team used 10,600m3 less water, reduced CO2e by 220 tons.Saving Water and Energy in the UKAt our Sheffield site in the UK, the team combined improvement in the jellies pump seals and in the flash vessel tank to reduce water and save energy. The site saved 10,950m3 of water and 150 MWh of energy thanks to these two projects.Making a Big Difference in BrazilOur Curitiba site, in Brazil, optimized the Clean-In-Place (CIP) process, cooling water recycling in several systems, and in turn, using 9,820m3 less water.Extending Our Water StrategyBuilding on our experience in our own operations, in 2021 we used the Aqueduct tools to expand our water scarcity assessment from manufacturing to an end-to-end approach beyond our own operations to include our commodities. This enabled us to start a more comprehensive water enterprise risk assessment, which in turn will lead us to develop and launch an End-to-End Water Stewardship Strategy in 2022.1 The Food Waste generated in 2018 and 2019 was estimated due to lack of data granularity. The estimation was calculated using the contribution of Food Waste to the Total Waste indicator in year 2020 (year we started collecting granular data). An assumption was made that this contribution was constant in the previous years and it was applied to the verified 2018 and 2019 Total Waste numbers. Waste exceptions apply.2 This indicator was updated in 2021 to reflect the new baseline (2018) and an expanded list of priority sites, according to an analysis based on the Aqueduct tool from World Resources Institute.Read more in the Mondelēz 2021 Snacking Made Right ReportMondelēz International, Thursday, October 13, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Mondelēz International on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Mondelēz InternationalWebsite: https://www.mondelezinternational.comEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Mondelēz InternationalView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/720302/Mondelz-Snacking-Made-Right-Report-Waste-Water]"

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Specifically, we decided to study Mondelez International's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Mondelez International How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Mondelez International is:14% = US$3.9b ÷ US$28b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.14 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Mondelez International's Earnings Growth And 14% ROEAt first glance, Mondelez International seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 14%. This probably goes some way in explaining Mondelez International's moderate 10% growth over the past five years amongst other factors.Story continuesWe then compared Mondelez International's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 4.3% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MDLZ? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Mondelez International Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Mondelez International has a three-year median payout ratio of 43%, which implies that it retains the remaining 57% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Besides, Mondelez International has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 51%. Still, forecasts suggest that Mondelez International's future ROE will rise to 17% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that Mondelez International's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down, as forecasted in the current analyst estimates.

In addition, the supply chain disruption is slowing Applied’s growth rate.Long-term investors should accumulate AMAT stock. The semiconductor market will grow in the mid-to-high-single-digits. The industry is worth $1 trillion by 2030. Applied’s customers have high capital intensity. They will always need wafer fab equipment. Expect the company to post free cash flow growth as it rebounds from the weak market conditions.In 2023, Applied Materials will benefit from its heavy investments in panel processing and packaging. It has capabilities in wafers and larger substrates. Applied will realize growth from early investments during the bull phase of the chip cycle. This year, it reduced its spending. By cutting the cost of goods sold and operating expenses, the company maintained positive free cash flow.Story continuesThe semiconductor firm pays $1.04 a share in dividends.Best Buy (BBY)A photo of a Best Buy store front.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comBest Buy (NYSE:BBY) is an electronics specialty retailer. Management skillfully kept inventory at healthy levels. It will not need to sell goods at a steep discount to clear those goods.Best Buy has inventory in the gaming console, PC gaming, and virtual reality. Fortunately, those are all popular areas that consumers want. As Best Buy enters the holiday period, chances are good that its supply will meet that of consumer demand.Suppliers will keep innovating their products. Although consumers might struggle with lower disposable income, they cannot delay upgrading their technology for too long. Best Buy is the first place they will visit to fulfill that need.Compared with online retailers, this firm has competent sales staff. Totaltech support also gives customers reassurance. Should they require help, they may count on this retailer.To fuel its growth, Best Buy has experimental stores spread geographically. It is testing markets to optimize its store portfolio. This will lift same-store sales in future quarters making it one of the best undervalued high-growth stocks.CVS Health (CVS)earnings reports cvsSource: ShutterstockCVS Health (NYSE:CVS) reported strong revenue and adjusted operating growth. It also raised its adjusted earnings per share guidance for the full year. Importantly, CVS increased its cash flow from the operations guidance range. This gives it the option to hike its dividend of $2.20 a share, or 2.21% annually. Alternatively, it could pay down its debt or buy back more shares.CVS stock could trade at new highs if it returned capital to loyal shareholders. Instead, the company is determined to fuel its growth by acquiring companies. The strategy works if it is buying deeply discounted targets. Until asset values for targets fall, CVS investors deserve a higher dividend instead.In 2023, CVS will have capital expenditure levels similar to that of this year. In addition, it will have similar cash flow levels. Markets would likely bid the stock higher if CVS built its cash levels on hand. By 2024, unprofitable target acquisitions might sell themselves at a big discount.Mondelez International (MDLZ)The Mondelez website magnified by a magnifying glassSource: ShutterstockMondelez International (NASDAQ:MDLZ) rallied after posting revenue growing by 8.1% Y/Y to $7.76 billion. It raised its organic net revenue growth outlook. It expects growth of 10% or higher.MDLZ stock trades at a seemingly high forward P/E of 21.6 times. However, it earned the premium. It posted strong top-line performance, driven by resilience in its categories. Consumers want to consume more chocolate and biscuits.In the emerging market, Mondelez said that the emerging markets lifted its results. For example, it benefited from broad-based strength from China to India to Brazil. Conversely, customer disruptions hurt its Europe operations. When inflation rates ease in Europe, Mondelez will post a rebound in margins.Mondelez enjoys a strong moat in the food industry. Consumers cannot live without chocolate. They will allocate some of their grocery budgets to keep buying this affordable indulgence.The company has the flexibility to raise product prices. If input costs rise, it will pass the higher costs to customers. They will willingly pay. Investors should buy MDLZ stock on any pullback.Target (TGT)an image of bullseye the target dog in a target storeSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.comTarget (NYSE:TGT) is a retailer that continues to manage its inventory as demand weakens. Still, category trends changed earlier this year. Customers altered their spending habits but still shop in-store and online at Target.In the back half of the year, Target has multiple seasonal strengths. The winter holiday celebrations will drive sales higher. Investors should watch for Target’s operating margins to hold around 7%. Last year, it posted margins of 6.8%, and 6.5% the year before that.Earlier this year, freight costs and elevated fuel prices hurt Target’s profitability. Today, inventory is likely lower while freight costs are down. Energy prices are not rising as fast as they once did. This will lower the firm’s input costs. It also increases the disposable income of Target’s customers.The supply chain constraint is not likely an ongoing issue. The company’s management team worked through those issues in a short period. This limited the damage to the business making it one of the undervalued high-growth stocks to keep on your radar.United Parcel Service (UPS)Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.Source: monticello / ShutterstockUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) posted a good quarter. Its revenue grew by 4.2% year over year to $24.2 billion in Q3. It expects to achieve an adjusted operating margin of 13.7% this year.UPS stock is a buy because the company will pay dividends worth $5.2 billion. It will also buy back at least $3 billion worth of stock. These actions will limit the downside risks in the stock.UPS will find around $300 million worth of productivity in the back half of the year. As a result, it will improve the delivery firm’s performance efficiencies. By tracking packages effectively and delivering them on or ahead of schedule, UPS will cut overtime hours. This will lower the company’s drive and staff costs.UPS has an appealing service compared to its competitors. For example, it offers a 7-day residential service. It also offers Saturday pickup for its business customers. This resulted in long-term revenue growth and market share expansion.Walmart (WMT)Image of Walmart (WMT) logo on Walmart store with clear blue sky in the backgroundSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comWalmart (NYSE:WMT) is addressing its bloated inventory issues.

The company will price its goods to reflect its cost structure.Walmart enjoys a strong brand name that draws customers to its stores. Both Walmart and Sam’s Club are recognized globally. This lowers its risk of relying solely on the U.S. for its strong performance. To strengthen its online presence, Walmart is investing in its e-commerce unit. It takes its digital transformation seriously.Investors should expect Walmart to grow its marketplace, despite the short-term pressures it faces. Fortunately, its online competitors are stumbling. This gives the company a rare chance to take market share.Just as supply chain constraints benefit the companies mentioned, Walmart will also see lower supply chain costs. Expect it to issue strong profit guidance when sales growth outpaces the rise in supply costs.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $84.5 million, the contract is scheduled to be completed by October 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Boeing will offer CFM56-7B27A/3 and CFM56-7B27AE engine depot-level maintenance and repair for P-8A Poseidon jets.The contract will serve the U.S. Navy, the government of Australia and foreign military sales customers. The majority of the work related to this deal will be executed in Atlanta, GA.What’s Favoring Boeing?Boeing, being one of the major players in the defense business, stands out among its peers by virtue of its broadly diversified programs, strong order bookings and solid backlog. Furthermore, the company's expertise lies in a wide variety of aircraft components, repairs and modification-related programs.Notably, its Defense, Space &amp; Security segment’s portfolio has fixed-wing military aircraft, including F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-15 programs, P-8 programs, KC-46A Tanker and T-7A Red Hawk. Boeing's combat-proven aerospace programs and associated services, along with the rapidly growing need for military aircraft due to heightened geopolitical uncertainties worldwide, result in a solid inflow of orders from the Pentagon. The latest contract win is an example of that. Such order flows, in turn, should boost the top line of the defense business segment.Growth ProspectsWith rising security threats across the globe, emerging economies like the Asia Pacific, the Middle East and South America are spending a lot on enhancing their defense arsenals. Meanwhile, developed nations like the United States and Europe have already been leading the defense market. With the United States being the largest worldwide weapons exporter, the nation has been spending amply on defense products. Boeing, the largest aircraft manufacturer in the United States, thus enjoys a dominant position in the combat aircraft market.Per a Mordor Intelligence report, the global combat aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 2.5% during the 2021-2026 time period, with North America constituting the largest share of this market. Such growth can be attributed to a rise in global threats and geopolitical instabilities and increased spending on defense. These projections should benefit Boeing along with other U.S.-based combat jet manufacturers like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed Martin LMT and Textron TXT.Story continuesSince its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft for combat. Northrop Grumman also has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft, such as manned, unmanned, targeting, surveillance, and aircraft self-protection systems that enable warfighters to accomplish missions anytime and anywhere.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 2.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2022 sales implies an improvement of 1.9%.Lockheed’s Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.

If you want to read about some more inflation stocks, go directly to 5 Best Inflation Stocks to Buy According to Hedge Funds.Inflationary pressures in the past few months have forced the Federal Reserve in the United States to raise rates five times this year. The total increase comes to about 3 percentage points, a figure expected to rise by 0.75 percentage points when the central bank meets again in three weeks. Inflation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics continues to paint a bleak picture for the economy. Per latest numbers, the producer price index, a measure of prices that US businesses get for the goods and services they produce, increased 0.4% in September. The increase excluded food, energy, and trade services and represented a 5.6% rise from a year ago. Food prices led to an increase in goods inflation, with a 1.2% monthly hike. Energy rose 0.7% after posting massive gains the previous two months. US President Joe Biden has played down risks of a recession in the US in the wake of these figures, telling CNN recently that he did not think the US would sink into a recession, but even if it did, he expected it to be a very slight one, remarking that finance experts predicted a recession every six months. Investors who are anticipating a recession in the US economy have loaded up on some of the best inflation stocks like Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc.

Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas, the chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, recently told reporters that “the worst is yet to come, and for many people, 2023 will feel like a recession”. Our MethodologyThese companies that have shown historical resilience against an inflationary environment were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed.

The company received an all-cash takeover offer from rival Philip Morris International Inc. (NYSE:PM), which we also held in the portfolio, for SEK 106 per share—a 35% premium to Swedish Match’s prior closing share price. The deal is a good fit for PM as it reduces PM’s dependence on cigarettes—a category in steady decline—and accelerates the company’s transition to smokeless “reduced-risk” products (RRPs)—a category that has experienced rapid growth over the past five years. PM can also leverage its global scale to generate significant revenue synergies from these complementary product sets, as well as quickly gain access to the US market—the world’s largest market for RRPs and one where regulators have embraced RRPs and other less harmful nicotine products. We exited our position in Swedish Match as shares approached the takeout price.”7.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.4bUS$10.9bUS$10.8bUS$13.1bUS$13.8bUS$14.5bUS$15.0bUS$15.5bUS$15.9bUS$16.3bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x6Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 5.46%Est @ 4.42%Est @ 3.69%Est @ 3.18%Est @ 2.82%Est @ 2.57% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 5.7% US$9.9kUS$9.8kUS$9.1kUS$10.5kUS$10.5kUS$10.4kUS$10.2kUS$9.9kUS$9.6kUS$9.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$99bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 5.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$16b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (5.7%– 2.0%) = US$444bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$444b÷ ( 1 + 5.7%)10= US$255bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$354b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$55.1, the company appears quite good value at a 33% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Coca-Cola as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 5.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For Coca-Cola, there are three further items you should consider:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Coca-Cola   you should know about.Future Earnings: How does KO's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Whirlpool's current trading price of US$143 reflective of the actual value of the mid-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Whirlpool’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Whirlpool What's The Opportunity In Whirlpool?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 12% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Whirlpool today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $161.59, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Whirlpool’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What kind of growth will Whirlpool generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Whirlpool's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 45%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in WHR’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company.

An official groundbreaking and celebration will take place at 8:30 a.m. October 8 at the building site in Osage Place, Habitat's third neighborhood in Monroe County, Indiana.Local and national Habitat representatives will be joined at the event by volunteers, campus leaders and several current and retired Whirlpool Corp. executives. The executives include those with strong ties to Kelley, such as Jim Peters, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Whirlpool Corporation, who earned an MBA in 1998, and retired CEO Jeff Fettig, who earned a bachelor's degree and MBA before joining the company in 1981.New homeowner Maria Magno-Perez and her three children will symbolically receive the keys to their new home on the field at Memorial Stadium before IU's homecoming football game against the University of Michigan following the event.Many students participating in the build are involved with the Kelley Institute for Social Impact, which serves as a hub within the school for socially conscious undergraduate students who want to make a difference in local and global communities through education, service, career development and leadership opportunities. More than 2,600 IU students, staff, faculty and alumni have come together to build the previous 11 homes alongside Monroe County families.Story continues""We are very proud of the students, faculty and staff who support this build. It not only helps a local family but also reinforces the values we stress at the Kelley School,"" said Ash Soni, interim dean of the Kelley School and the SungKyunKwan Professor. ""Whirlpool Corp. is one of today's most socially responsible companies, and this experience provides our students with an excellent example to emulate when they take on leadership roles at organizations. We appreciate this opportunity for our students to see social and environmental responsibility in action and up close.""""This is always a great weekend, working side by side with the homeowner, helping them build their dream house,"" Peters said. ""This year is especially exciting as we have many of our employees working alongside Kelley School of Business students. It's a great opportunity for the students to learn more about Whirlpool and potential career opportunities.""For the Magno-Perez family, it has been a long wait. They were approved to become homeowners in 2019, but their build was delayed by COVID-19 and supply-chain issues for materials.Magno-Perez, a single mother, works in construction and cleans houses. The family rents a costly apartment where she said the landlord often is slow to make needed repairs. ""One of the dreams of my children is to have their own home, to have their own space,"" Magno-Perez said. ""I like to be outside, and I look forward to having a little table and being able to hang out with friends and family on my new porch and not be shut in, like I would be in an apartment.""Families qualify for the Habitat program based on three criteria: need for housing, ability to pay back their affordable mortgage and a willingness to partner. Each adult member living in a Habitat home must invest 250 hours of volunteering, called sweat equity, before closing on their house. Each home in Osage Place, on the southwest side of Bloomington, is energy efficient and built to net-zero energy capability, including being solar ready.""We look forward to this special build each fall, and are excited to once again partner with the Whirlpool Corporation, Indiana University and the Kelley School of Business,"" said Wendi Goodlett, CEO of Habitat for Humanity of Monroe County. ""We have many opportunities to work with the KISI office throughout the year, but we especially love welcoming new groups of IU students, staff and faculty to build with us.""We are honored to serve as the start and end point of Whirlpool Corp.'s House+Home campaign, and we will be returning to our Osage Place neighborhood to build in partnership with Maria and her children. Thanks to the BuildBetter initiative and Whirlpool's support, Maria's home will be equipped with solar panels and will provide an opportunity to immediately decrease her family's utility expenses and carbon footprint.""Gifts of financial support and time from donors like Whirlpool create a lasting impact for future families. As Maria begins paying her mortgage and building equity in her home, her mortgage payments will help fund the materials needed to serve future Habitat families.""Whirlpool Corp. and Habitat for Humanity have collaborated for 23 years to build a better world where families have access to safe, decent and affordable housing. As of fiscal year 2022, Whirlpool Corp. has donated more than $136 million in funding and products to Habitat since 1999, including 212,807 appliances like ranges and refrigerators for Habitat homes in the U.S., Canada, Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East and Latin America.

383,b86ebcc7-e60f-3ece-848e-0a5ebe4ba49d,WHR,2022-10-14,Earnings Preview: Whirlpool (WHR) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-whirlpool-whr-q3-140002730.html,1665669602,STORY,['WHR'],"[Whirlpool (WHR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis maker of Maytag, KitchenAid and other appliances is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.72 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -14.4%.Revenues are expected to be $5.27 billion, down 4% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Whirlpool?For Whirlpool, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.59%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Whirlpool will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Whirlpool would post earnings of $5.23 per share when it actually produced earnings of $5.97, delivering a surprise of +14.15%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Whirlpool doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

390,92a26d3a-ac62-3580-845a-e350a873599b,GE,2022-10-14,General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 68% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-electric-company-nyse-ge-120029203.html,1665748829,STORY,['GE'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 68% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about General Electric. View our latest analysis for General Electric ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About General Electric?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that General Electric does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see General Electric's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in General Electric. Capital Research and Management Company is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.0% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 7.8% and 6.3%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 19 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of General ElectricThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our information suggests that General Electric Company insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$181m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 32% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over General Electric. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand General Electric better, we need to consider many other factors.Many find it useful to take an in depth look at how a company has performed in the past.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Progressive Progressive Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe President of Personal Lines, Patrick Callahan, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.4m worth of shares at a price of US$126 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$122. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.In the last year Progressive insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Progressive better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Progressive Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Progressive shares. In total, President of Personal Lines Patrick Callahan dumped US$2.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Story continuesInsider OwnershipAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. Progressive insiders own about US$250m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.So What Do The Progressive Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold Progressive shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. To assist with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Progressive.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

This compares to earnings of $0.14 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -60.48%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this insurer would post earnings of $0.95 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.95, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates just once.Progressive , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Property and Casualty industry, posted revenues of $13 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.23%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $11.82 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Progressive shares have added about 18.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -25%.What's Next for Progressive?While Progressive has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Progressive: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.61 on $13.21 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.62 on $50.85 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Insurance - Property and Casualty is currently in the bottom 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Travelers (TRV), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on October 19.This insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.83 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -29.6%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Travelers' revenues are expected to be $9.17 billion, up 4.2% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

401,d6f62f38-5a9a-341f-b16a-4a3c990c040f,VLO,2022-10-14,Bet on 3 Dividend Stocks to Combat Energy Market Volatility,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bet-3-dividend-stocks-combat-130801619.html,1665666481,STORY,"['VLO', 'MPC', 'PSX']","[Notorious volatility is an integral part of the energy sector, as reflected in the wild swings in oil prices since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. However, due to some key factors, dividend-paying stocks in the same space are relatively less volatile, thereby making Marathon Petroleum Corporation MPC, Valero Energy Corporation VLO and Phillips 66 PSX well-poised to gain.Extremely Volatile Energy MarketWe should not forget how oil prices have behaved since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020.However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which in turn led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Dividend Stocks to the RescueOverall oil pricing scenario seems scary, which could easily deter an investor from allocating money to energy companies. Despite this volatility constraint, investors could consider dividend-paying companies belonging to the industry. This is because, generally, companies with stable dividend-paying history are usually relatively less volatile than stocks with no dividend history. It is expected that companies that have been rewarding stockholders with dividends will try their best to continue paying at the same pace or higher, making the stocks attractive and less volatile to the vagaries of the market.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three such stocks. Two of the stocks sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while one carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). With a dividend yield of more than 2%, all the companies have raised dividends over the past five years. Moreover, with a payout ratio of less than 60%, the companies ensure sustainability with enough scope for future dividend increases.Story continues3 Stocks in the SpotlightMarathon Petroleum Corporation: As a leading, integrated, downstream energy player, Marathon Petroleum is the operator of the largest refining system in the nation. Handsome margins and throughput in all regions are aiding MPC. #1 Ranked Marathon Petroleum pays out a quarterly dividend of 58 cents ($2.32 annualized) per share, which gives it a 2.21% yield at the current stock price.

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.Another thing that can drive investing is the fear of missing out, or FOMO. This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Valero Energy (VLO) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to VLO for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Valero Energy's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Valero Energy's main business drivers.San Antonio, TX-based Valero Energy Corporation is the largest independent refiner and marketer of petroleum products in the United States. The company was founded in 1980. It has a refining capacity of 3.1 million barrels per day across 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom.Moreover, Valero is a leading ethanol producer with 14 ethanol plants in the Midwest that have a combined capacity of 1.73 billion gallons per year. The products of the company are sold in the markets of the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Latin America. The company’s brand names are carried by around 7,000 outlets.The company organizes its business through three reportable segments, namely, Refining, Ethanol and Renewable Diesel.Refining: The Refining segment was responsible for 81.7% of the total margin in 2021. It includes refining operations, wholesale marketing, product supply and distribution, and transportation operations. This segment is segregated geographically into the Gulf Coast, mid-continent, West Coast and Northeast regions.Ethanol: The Ethanol segment includes sales of internally produced ethanol and distillers grains. Operations of this segment are geographically located in the Central Plains region of the United States. This segment was responsible for 10.3% of the total margin in 2021.Renewable Diesel: In the first quarter of 2019, the company created this segment. The Renewable Diesel segment incorporates the operations of a consolidated joint venture, Diamond Green Diesel. Notably, the renewable diesel plant is North America’s largest biomass-based diesel plant and it is located in Norco, LA. The segment provided 8% of the total margin in 2021, which was supported by the expansion of the Diamond Green Diesel plant.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Valero Energy, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in October 2012 would be worth $3,971.04, or a gain of 297.10%, as of October 13, 2022, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 150.39% and the price of gold increased -8.27% over the same time frame in comparison.Looking ahead, analysts are expecting more upside for VLO.Among all the independent refiners, Valero offers the most diversified refinery base with a capacity of 3.2 million barrels per day in its 15 refineries located throughout the United States, Canada and the Caribbean. The majority of Valero’s refining plants are located at the Gulf coast area from where there is easy access to the export facilities. The Gulf coast presence helped it to expand export volumes over the past years and gain from high distillate margins. Also, it intends to quadruple renewable diesel production capacity by 2023. With low-carbon fuel policies being adopted by economies globally, demand for renewable fuel is expected to significantly rise in the coming days. VLO reported strong second-quarter results due to higher refinery throughput volumes. Thus, Valero is considered a preferred energy firm to own now.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 5.12%, and there have been 5 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2022 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

403,3ab06d1d-df73-3564-b806-276bbdcd7971,VLO,2022-10-14,The 7 Most Undervalued Value Stocks to Buy Now,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-undervalued-value-stocks-201008971.html,1665432608,STORY,"['VLO', 'PFE', 'BA', 'BMY', 'DAL', 'XOM', 'PG']","[The term “value stocks” refers to shares of companies that appear to be underpriced relative to their fundamentals. In the column below, I will provide you with information about seven undervalued value stocks that investors should buy now. I used multiple criteria, including financial results, price-earnings ratios, and analysts’ price targets to determine which stocks are in the latter category.Investors can contrast value stocks with growth stocks which often appear overpriced relative to their fundamentals.  Value stocks have come into their own in 2022 because this year has been particularly brutal on growth stocks. As the Fed raises interest rates, the cost of borrowing increases. That makes growth firms, which often have a great deal of debt, particularly risky. That is why capital has flown out of tech and other growth equities and into value stocks. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDespite that trend, there are still plenty of undervalued value stocks for investors to buy.BMYBristol Myers Squibb$68.50DALDelta$29.39PFEPfizer$41.80VLOValero$111PFEPfizer$41.80PGProcter &amp; Gamble$124XOMExxon Mobil$99Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY)Bristol-Myers (BMY) logo at the top of a cellphone.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comI’d argue that Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) stock is significantly undervalued due to multiple factors. Bristol Myers Squibb is, first of all, quite profitable. Specifically, the pharmaceutical company boasts a gross margin above 79%. That is higher than all but 8% of the more than 1,000 pharma firms in its peer group. Investors who recognize that analysts’ average price target for BMY stock is roughly 15% above the stock’s current level can start to understand why many see it as a strong value pick. There is some irony in the fact that BMY stock remains underpriced because it has bested analysts’ average earnings expectations in each of the last four quarters for which it has posted results. And for the second quarter, it posted earnings per share of $1.93, versus analysts’ average estimate of $1.70. Story continuesThe company’s performance has been greatly enhanced by multiple drugs that generate at least $1 billion of revenue annually, including Eliquis, Opdivo, and Revlimid. In Q2, the three therapeutics collectively contributed $7.8 billion of Bristol Myers Squibb’s $11.9 billion of sales. Pharmaceutical companies generally rely on one or more lucrative treatments to fund their research and development. That R&amp;D, in turn, fuels their future success. Bristol Myers Squibb clearly has very profitable drugs. Therefore, it is well- positioned for continued success. Delta (DAL)Delta (DAL) airlines plane mid take-offSource: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.comDelta Air Lines (NYSE:DAL) is emerging from a pandemic that dealt the Atlanta-based firm heavy losses. It is also among the largest airlines in the world as measured by fleet size and travelers served. Its size caused it to report massive losses during the pandemic as its fleet sat idle. Consequently, it  racked up a great deal of debt. At the end of Q2, the airlines had $19.6 billion of debt. But Delta continues to pay down its debt and plans to reduce the figure to only $15 billion by 2024. Now the pandemic is essentially over, travel has rebounded, and Delta is through the worst of it. Investors need not worry that the company will be irreparably broken as it was during the pandemic. But the market continues to undervalue DAL stock, which currently trades around $30. Analysts’ average price target for DAL stock is $48. That’s roughly 60% above the stock’s current level. Analysts’ price targets are based on their estimates of where price targets will be in 12 months to 18 months. Valero (VLO)the gas pumps at a Valero gas stationSource: JustPixs / Shutterstock.comValero (NYSE:VLO) stock is sitting in a fortuitous position currently. With OPEC recently announcing that it intends to slash oil production by more than 2 million barrels per day, prices at the pump are set to rise. While that results in higher costs at the pump for you and me, it benefits Valero, the world’s largest independent refiner. Refiners tend to benefit less than exploration firms when prices rise. That’s because  exploration firms sell oil directly from their fields or offshore deposits, while refiners have to buy oil first and then covert it into gasoline or other products. However, Valero’s strong financial performance  in the first half of 2022, when oil prices were high, shows that it benefits from elevated petroleum prices.So it’s evident that Valero has positive catalysts as OPEC reduces oil supplies. But Valero isn’t undervalued based on the notion that gas prices should rise soon. Rather, a combination of other factors, including Valero’s relatively low P/E ratio of 6.87, convinces me that VLO stock is being underestimated. More than 60% of the firms in the oil and gas industry carries a higher P/E ratio than VLO, making Valero attractive. Valero has had a very strong 2022, like so much of the oil and gas industry. With prices at the pump dropping sharply beginning in mid-June, it looked like the party may have been over. That doesn’t look to be the case as OPEC’s latest move roils the space’s supply-demand dynamics.Pfizer (PFE)Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comThe stock market is full of contradictions. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock’s performance this year fairly exemplifies its fickle nature. PFE shares have shed 29% of their value in 2022. That’s not very exceptional, and it is in line with the stock market’s performance.  But at the same time, it’s odd that so many investors have sold Pfizer’s shares. Pfizer’s financial results have been very strong in 2022.In fact, its revenues have increased by 60% YOY and 47% YOY in the first half of the year and Q2, respectively. It’s almost as if the market believes that Pfizer has lost its shine because the pandemic is winding down. But here’s the thing: Pfizer is expected to generate $54.5 billion of revenue from its Covid-19 drugs in 2022, up from $36.7 billion in 2021. The irony is that, based on P/E ratios, PFE stock is cheaper than 85% of all pharmaceutical stocks. All in all, Pfizer is one of the most undervalued value stocks in the pharmaceutical industry. Procter &amp; Gamble (PG)A Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) distribution center in Vandalia.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comProcter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) stock has fallen to a new 2022 low. The Cincinnati-based consumer goods giant has garnered a lot of press in 2022 as rising recession fears have given defensive stocks, including PG, a boost. Even Procter &amp; Gamble’s shares have fallen, though, as the Fed continues to take a hawkish position on inflation. Many on the Street believe this approach could cause something within the economy “to break,” inadvertently triggering a recession. Whether that happens or not, lean times are clearly here. And that means PG stock is a strong choice. Procter &amp; Gamble sells so-called consumer staples that consumers can’t go without. These are the items like tissues, toilet paper, toothpaste, razors, and deodorant for which there is relatively even demand no matter what the economy is doing. Consider the company’s history of creating value as measured by a return on invested capital of 13.48% that far outpaces its weighted average cost of capital, at 4.74%. Combine that with its dividend that hasn’t been reduced since 1957, and PG shares look deeply undervalued right now. Boeing (BA)Boeing (BA) passenger airplane with open exit door, passenger windows, cargo door, close up view of Boeing logoSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock.comBoeing (NYSE:BA) stock is in deep value territory. That value is evidenced by its price-sales ratio which is close to a two-year low and lower than three-fifths of the companies in the aerospace and defense industry. It isn’t hard to understand why when you consider everything that has happened to the firm over the last few years. The company produces aircraft that it sells in similar quantities.to the commercial sector and militaries. Most recently, Boeing reported just over $6 billion of sales for Q2. But the company is still reeling from the pandemic which caused its sales to grind to a halt as airlines’ fleets were grounded worldwide. And two of Boeing’s 737 Max planes crashed, leading to safety probes, fraud charges, and a $200 million settlement. Boeing has resumed deliveries of its 787 Dreamliner after a long delay. That development should boost the firm moving forward.The bullish case for Boeing is relatively straightforward: It is one of only two major airplane manufacturers in the world. For the most part, investors simply have to buy its shares now and wait for the current macroeconomic issues to ease over time. Exxon Mobil (XOM)Exxon Mobil logo outside of a corporate buildingSource: Harry Green / Shutterstock.comExxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock is seriously undervalued for similar reasons that Valero’s shares are undervalued. That is, OPEC’s recent decision to cut its production by 2 million barrels per day should directly benefit Exxon Mobil’s chances moving forward. Q2 was exceptionally positive for Exxon Mobil as it posted profits of $17.9 billion, drastically higher than the $4.69 billion of earnings that it reported during the same period a year prior. But market conditions changed at the tail end of Q2 as oil prices began to steadily decline. Now that OPEC is curbing its production, oil prices appear likely to rise again. On the one hand, XOM stock isn’t very far from being fully priced currently, as it trades slightly below  analysts’ average price target of $107. I believe the shares could exceed $130 as investors search for real returns i.e. profits over and above inflation, in the increasingly tough market. XOM’s dividend yields 3.5% so the stock’s returns aren’t dependent on the upward movement of its stock price alone. XOM stock is also undervalued based on its strong return on equity (ROE) which is better than 75% of the competitors in its sector. ROE measures how effectively a firm turns equity capital into profits. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Morgan Stanley MS, UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, United Airlines Holdings Inc. UAL and First Horizon Corp. FHN.Here are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:5 Large-Cap Stocks Likely to Beat on Q3 EarningsU.S. stock markets are set for the third-quarter 2022 earnings season commencing this week.  Market participants will keenly watch this earnings season as it will provide the most descriptive view of U.S. corporate health amid record-high inflation and an extremely hawkish Fed.In addition to revenues and the net profit numbers of companies, several metrics of margins, like gross margin, operating margin and net margin will be of immense importance to investors this earnings cycle. Moreover, the outlook of U.S. corporations will guide the next course of Wall Street’s movement.Our estimates for third-quarter earnings of the market’s benchmark, the S&amp;P 500 Index, have shown a gradual decline in the past three and a half months. As of Oct 12, per our estimation for the third quarter as a whole, total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index will rise a mere 0.1% year over year on 9.1% higher revenues.We have identified five large-cap stocks that are set to beat on third-quarter earnings. Investment in these stocks should be fruitful as an earnings beat is expected to drive stock prices going forward. These companies are — Morgan Stanley, UnitedHealth Group Inc., Lockheed Martin Corp., United Airlines Holdings Inc. and First Horizon Corp.Q3 at a GlanceLike the first half, the third quarter of 2022 also remained tough for the U.S. economy. Various measures of inflation remained elevated at a 40-year high. The Fed has hiked the benchmark interest rate by 3% so far in 2022 and it was in the range of 3.25% to 3.5% at the end of the third quarter. Moreover, the central bank has started to reduce the size of its $9 trillion balance sheet systematically since June.Story continuesDespite these aggressive monetary policies adopted by the Fed, inflation is showing no signs of declining. The complete devastation of the global supply-chain system and the shortage of labor continued to put pressure on businesses in the form of higher input costs and wages.The lingering war between Russia and Ukraine and the lockdown in China due to the resurgence of COVID-19 infections were the major hindrances to the restoration of the global supply-chain system. Agencies like the IMF, the World Bank and the OECD have warned of a possible global recession in 2023.Stocks in FocusFive large-cap companies will report third-quarter 2022 earnings within the next seven days.

413,736f1181-d09f-37d6-93e2-07fa27afa5eb,PG,2022-10-14,Here's How Procter & Gamble (PG) Looks Ahead of Q1 Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-procter-gamble-pg-looks-130201832.html,1665666121,STORY,"['PG', 'ACI', 'SAM', 'ADM']","[The Procter &amp; Gamble Company PG is set to report first-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Oct 19, before the opening bell. The company is expected to deliver sales growth in the to-be-reported quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal first-quarter earnings is pegged at $1.56 per share, indicating a 3.1% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark has moved down by a penny in the past seven days. For fiscal first-quarter revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $20.56 billion, suggesting 1.1% growth from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.We expect the company’s fiscal first-quarter total revenues to increase 0.6% year over year to $20,451.5 million and the bottom line to decline 2.6% to $1.57 per share.In the last reported quarter, the company delivered a negative earnings surprise of 1.6%. It has delivered a bottom-line beat of 1.04%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Procter &amp; Gamble Company The Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Procter &amp; Gamble Company The Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseProcter &amp; Gamble Company The price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Procter &amp; Gamble Company The QuoteKey Factors to NoteProcter &amp; Gamble has been gaining from improved productivity and persistent demand for cleaning products. The company’s first-quarter fiscal 2023 results are expected to reflect the benefits of continued strength in brands and appropriate strategies, which have been aiding organic sales growth. Notably, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for organic sales growth is pegged at 5.6%, which suggests an improvement from 4% growth reported in the prior-year quarter.The company has been focused on productivity and cost-saving plans, which have been aiding its margins. PG has been witnessing cost savings and efficiency improvements across all facets of its business, driven by the productivity program. Its continued business investments and efforts to offset macro cost headwinds, and balanced top and bottom-line growth underscore its productivity efforts. Gains from productivity savings and pricing are expected to have aided margins and the bottom line in the fiscal first quarter.Moreover, the company is likely to have witnessed SG&amp;A expense leverage, owing to savings from overhead and marketing expenses, and cost leverage gains due to higher sales and real estate.However, unfavorable mix, commodity cost inflation, increase in freight costs, and product and packaging investments are expected to have marred margins in the to-be-reported quarter.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, Procter &amp; Gamble predicted higher commodity and freight costs to persist throughout fiscal 2023. Our estimate indicates a 0.7% year-over-year decline in gross profit for the fiscal first quarter, with the gross profit margin contracting 60 bps.Also, currency headwinds are likely to have hurt the company’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Rising input costs are expected to have weighed on the fiscal first-quarter performance. Our estimate indicates a 3.1% impact from currency headwinds in the fiscal first quarter.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Procter &amp; Gamble this time around.

414,aafd71c1-eb7f-382f-a9ac-f6c8e60970d6,PG,2022-10-14,Procter & Gamble Company The (PG) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/procter-gamble-company-pg-attracting-130001712.html,1665666001,STORY,['PG'],"[Procter &amp; Gamble (PG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this world's largest consumer products maker have returned -10.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -12.9% change. The Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, to which P&amp;G belongs, has lost 10.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.P&amp;G is expected to post earnings of $1.56 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.87 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +1%. This estimate has changed -1.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.29 indicates a change of +7.1% from what P&amp;G is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, P&amp;G is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PG _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For P&amp;G, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $20.48 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +0.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $80.76 billion and $84.22 billion estimates indicate +0.7% and +4.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryP&amp;G reported revenues of $19.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3%. EPS of $1.21 for the same period compares with $1.13 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $19.39 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.63%. The EPS surprise was -1.63%.Over the last four quarters, P&amp;G surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.P&amp;G is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about P&amp;G. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The investment supports American's science based targets to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2035, and ultimately its commitment to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050. This investment makes American the first U.S. airline to make two direct investments focused on the development of both hydrogen-electric propulsion technology and the future of hydrogen distribution logistics.Universal Hydrogen's fuel distribution network uses modular hydrogen capsules that are handled like cargo, eliminating the need for new fueling infrastructure at airports and speeding up fuel loading operations. Universal Hydrogen anticipates starting hydrogen deliveries for regional aircraft in 2025, with plans to expand its services to larger, single aisle aircraft - first for auxiliary power in the late-2020s and then as a primary fuel by the mid-2030s. Because these segments represent two-thirds of aviation emissions - and with green hydrogen being a true zero-carbon fuel - these advances put aviation on a path to meet Paris Agreement emissions targets.""This technology has the potential to be a game-changer on the industry's path to zero-emission flight,"" said American's Chief Financial Officer Derek Kerr. ""As the world's largest airline, American has a responsibility to exercise leadership in making aviation sustainable. Our investment in Universal Hydrogen represents a vote of confidence for green hydrogen as a key element of a sustainable future for our industry.""American joins Airbus Ventures, GE Aviation and Toyota Ventures, as well as several major hydrogen producers and aircraft lessors, as strategic investors in Universal Hydrogen.""Together with our investors, we are putting together the end-to-end value chain to make hydrogen aviation a near-term commercial reality,"" said Paul Eremenko, co-founder and CEO of Universal Hydrogen. ""This move by American is a strong signal that customers want a true zero-emissions solution for passenger aviation and are willing to back tangible, pragmatic steps to get there quickly.""Story continuesAbout American Airlines GroupTo Care for People on Life's Journey®.

Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Airlines Group Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAmerican Airlines Group Inc. price-eps-surprise | American Airlines Group Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things are shaping up for American Airlines this earnings season.Q3 ExpectationsThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for American Airlines’ third-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $13.23 billion, indicating 47.6% growth year over year. The top line is likely to have been aided by a solid recovery of air-travel demand and an improvement in passenger revenues.Moreover, AAL’s bullish top-line guidance is also encouraging. Total revenues in the third quarter of 2022 are anticipated to be roughly 10-12% higher than the level recorded in third-quarter 2019. Management expects TRASM to be 20-24% higher than third-quarter 2019 actuals.On the flip side, an increase in oil prices continues to bother AAL’s bottom line. The fuel cost per gallon in third-quarter 2022 is expected in the $3.73-$3.78 band. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for average fuel price per gallon (including related taxes) is pegged at $3.85, indicating growth of 85.9% from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for American Airlines this time around.

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis world's largest airline is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.44 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +144.4%.Revenues are expected to be $13.24 billion, up 47.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 107.98% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for American Airlines?For American Airlines, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -12.16%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that American Airlines will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that American Airlines would post earnings of $0.79 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.76, delivering a surprise of -3.80%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.American Airlines doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more industrial stocks, go directly to 5 Best Industrial Stocks To Buy Now.The United States economy in 2022 has not been as vibrant as 2021. In fact, soaring inflation and rising interest rates have combined to raise recession fears and resulted in a broad selloff at the stock market, pushing down benchmark indexes and turning investors away from even value-oriented sectors such as financials, industrials, materials and energy. However, as travel demand picks up again, inflation cools down, and infrastructure spending ramps up, industrial stocks in particular seem well-positioned to make a strong comeback. Some of the best industrial stocks to buy in this context include TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM). Another catalyst for industrial stocks is the Russian war in Ukraine that has led to increased defense spending around the world. A quick solution to the war seems increasingly unlikely. Thus, aerospace and defense stocks are poised to outperform the broader industry in the coming months. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the industrial sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.13 Best Industrial Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Lenny Kuhne on UnsplashBest Industrial Stocks To Buy Now13. Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34    Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) manufactures and sells industrial products and equipment worldwide. It is one of the best industrial stocks to invest in. On August 24, Bank of America analyst Andrew Obin reinstated coverage of Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) stock with a Neutral rating and a $220 price target, stressing that the rating balances an improving long-term story with near-term macro headwinds.Story continuesAt the end of the second quarter of 2022, 34 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $366 million in Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW), compared to 36 in the previous quarter worth $426 million.Just like TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) is one of the best industrial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. 12. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35 Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) manufactures and sells motion and control technologies and systems for various mobile, industrial, and aerospace markets worldwide. It is one of the top industrial stocks to invest in. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) on September 16 sold its Aircraft Wheel and Brake Division, located in Avon, to Kaman Corporation. Aircraft Wheel &amp; Brake has been a trusted provider of mission-critical wheel and brake technology products and solutions for more than 80 years. On October 03, Barclays analyst Julian Mitchell kept an Overweight rating on Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) stock and lowered the price target to $320 from $340. Among the hedge funds being tracked by Insider Monkey, Connecticut-based firm Viking Global is a leading shareholder in Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), with 3 million shares worth more than $755.5 million. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), a U.S. company that specializes in motion and control technologies, is suffering from what we believe are investor misunderstandings and misjudgements, despite the efforts of the company’s unusually strong management team. In our opinion, since his promotion in 2015, CEO Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the product portfolio to longer cycled, higher growth, higher margin and higher return end markets. The results are impressive. Margins, returns and earnings have increased substantially. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition in the September quarter, the highly depressed aerospace segment will be its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which—combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses, including clean technologies and factory automation—should accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be similar or better. At a low-teens multiple of next year’s normalized cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.”11. Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36   Cummins Inc.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on Universal Health Services'  ROE.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. See our latest analysis for Universal Health Services How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Universal Health Services is:13% = US$763m ÷ US$5.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.13 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.A Side By Side comparison of Universal Health Services' Earnings Growth And 13% ROETo begin with, Universal Health Services seems to have a respectable ROE. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 15%. This probably goes some way in explaining Universal Health Services' moderate 6.1% growth over the past five years amongst other factors.Story continuesWe then compared Universal Health Services' net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 18% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if Universal Health Services is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry.Is Universal Health Services Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Universal Health Services' three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 6.2% (implying that it retains 94% of its income), which is on the lower side, so it seems like the management is reinvesting profits heavily to grow its business.Besides, Universal Health Services has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 6.5% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Universal Health Services' future ROE will be 14% which is again, similar to the current ROE.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Universal Health Services' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down.

429,ec3002a4-f4d5-3089-a55c-062940a54c56,FCX,2022-10-14,Earnings Preview: Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) Q3 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-freeport-mcmoran-fcx-140002520.html,1665669602,STORY,['FCX'],"[Freeport-McMoRan (FCX) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 20, 2022, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis mining company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.39 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -56.2%.Revenues are expected to be $5.31 billion, down 12.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.16% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Freeport-McMoRan?For Freeport-McMoRan, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -37.55%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Freeport-McMoRan will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Freeport-McMoRan would post earnings of $0.76 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.58, delivering a surprise of -23.68%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Freeport-McMoRan doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

430,ddf7627b-bce0-3730-ba37-7fb24ed6a283,LNT,2022-10-14,Alliant Energy's (NASDAQ:LNT) earnings growth rate lags the 5.5% CAGR delivered to shareholders,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/alliant-energys-nasdaq-lnt-earnings-120517031.html,1665749117,STORY,['LNT'],"[Alliant Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:LNT) shareholders might be concerned after seeing the share price drop 19% in the last month. But the silver lining is the stock is up over five years. Unfortunately its return of 13% is below the market return of 53%.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 3.4%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. View our latest analysis for Alliant Energy There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, Alliant Energy achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 10% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 2% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Alliant Energy has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Alliant Energy, it has a TSR of 31% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that Alliant Energy shares lost 9.3% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 22%. Of course, the long term returns are far more important and the good news is that over five years, the stock has returned 6% for each year. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Alliant Energy better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 2 warning signs for Alliant Energy (1 is concerning!) that you should be aware of before investing here.Story continuesBut note: Alliant Energy may not be the best stock to buy.

431,569d02a4-8dd2-380c-8b61-856edec9ff0b,PEP,2022-10-14,"Insiders at PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) sold US$11m worth of stock, a potential red flag that needs to be monitored",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insiders-pepsico-inc-nasdaq-pep-120022221.html,1665748822,STORY,['PEP'],"[While PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) shareholders have had a good week with the stock up 7.3%, they shouldn't let their guards down. In spite of the relatively cheap prices, insiders made the decision to sell US$11m worth of stock in the last 12 months. This could be a warning indicator of vulnerabilities in the future.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo PepsiCo Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Vice Chairman, Hugh Johnston, for US$6.0m worth of shares, at about US$161 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$175, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 20% of Hugh Johnston's holding.PepsiCo insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).PepsiCo Insiders Are Selling The StockOver the last three months, we've seen significant insider selling at PepsiCo. In total, insiders dumped US$900k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Insider Ownership Of PepsiCoMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. PepsiCo insiders own 0.1% of the company, currently worth about US$341m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About PepsiCo Insiders?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And there weren't any purchases to give us comfort, over the last year. But it is good to see that PepsiCo is growing earnings. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing PepsiCo. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 3 warning signs for PepsiCo you should know about.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NASDAQ: REGN) today announced the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has adopted a positive opinion for Libtayo® (cemiplimab) as a monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer and disease progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy. The European Commission is expected to make a final decision on the application in the coming months.The positive opinion is supported by results from the Phase 3 EMPOWER-Cervical 1 trial. In the trial (n=608), the primary endpoint of overall survival was met, with Libtayo reducing the risk of death by 31% (hazard ratio [HR]: 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.56-0.84; one-sided p&lt;0.001) in the total population and 27% in the squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) population (HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.58-0.91; one-sided p=0.003), compared to an investigator's choice of chemotherapy. No new Libtayo safety signals were observed. Among adverse events (AE) in 10% or more patients in either group, Grade 3 or higher AEs that occurred more often in the Libtayo group (n=300) than chemotherapy (n=290) included urinary tract infection (5% Libtayo, 3% chemotherapy), back pain (1% Libtayo, less than 1% chemotherapy), asthenia (2% Libtayo, 1% chemotherapy), arthralgia (less than 1% Libtayo, 0% chemotherapy) and pyrexia (less than 1% Libtayo, 0% chemotherapy). Detailed data were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in February 2022.Libtayo is currently approved in the European Union and other countries for the treatment of certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).Story continuesAbout the Phase 3 TrialEMPOWER-Cervical 1 was an open-label, multi-center Phase 3 trial that investigated Libtayo monotherapy versus an investigator's choice of commonly used chemotherapy in patients with recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer who had progressed on platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients (median age: 51 years) were randomized to receive Libtayo (350 mg every three weeks) or chemotherapy (pemetrexed, vinorelbine, topotecan, irinotecan or gemcitabine). The primary endpoint for the trial was overall survival analyzed first among patients with SCC, then in the total population.Patients were allowed to enroll regardless of PD-L1 expression status, with 78% of patients having SCC and 22% having adenocarcinoma or adenosquamous carcinoma. The trial included women from 14 countries: Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Greece, Italy, Japan, Poland, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, the UK and the U.S.In March 2021, the trial was stopped early based on the highly significant effect of Libtayo on overall survival among SCC patients and following a unanimous recommendation by the Independent Data Monitoring Committee.About Cervical CancerCervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in women worldwide and is most frequently diagnosed between the ages of 35 and 44. Approximately 600,000 new cases of cervical cancer and 350,000 deaths from cervical cancer occur worldwide each year. Almost all cases are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, with approximately 80% classified as SCC (arising from cells lining the bottom of the cervix) and the remainder largely adenocarcinomas (arising from glandular cells in the upper cervix). Cervical cancer is often curable when detected early and effectively managed, but treatment options are more limited in advanced stages.About Regeneron in OncologyAt Regeneron, we're applying more than three decades of scientific innovation with the goal of developing paradigm-changing therapies for patients with cancer. Our oncology portfolio is built around two foundational approaches – our approved PD-1 inhibitor Libtayo and investigational bispecific antibodies – which are being evaluated both as monotherapies and in combination with emerging therapeutic modalities. Together, they provide us with unique combinatorial flexibility to develop potentially synergistic treatments for a wide range of solid tumors and blood cancers.If you are interested in learning more about our clinical trials, please contact us (clinicaltrials@regeneron.com or 844-734-6643) or visit our clinical trials website.About LibtayoLibtayo is a fully human monoclonal antibody targeting the immune checkpoint receptor PD-1 on T cells and was invented using Regeneron's proprietary VelocImmune® technology. By binding to PD-1, Libtayo has been shown to block cancer cells from using the PD-1 pathway to suppress T-cell activation. In the U.S. and other countries Libtayo is indicated in certain patients with advanced basal cell carcinoma (BCC), advanced cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) and advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as in advanced cervical cancer in Canada and Brazil. As of July 1, 2022, Libtayo is developed and marketed globally by Regeneron.In the U.S., the generic name for Libtayo in its approved indications is cemiplimab-rwlc, with rwlc as the suffix designated in accordance with Nonproprietary Naming of Biological Products Guidance for Industry issued by the FDA. Outside of the U.S. the generic name of Libtayo in its approved indication is cemiplimab.The extensive clinical program for Libtayo is focused on difficult-to-treat cancers. Libtayo is currently being investigated in trials as a monotherapy, as well as in combination with either conventional or novel therapeutic approaches for other solid tumors and blood cancers. These potential uses are investigational, and their safety and efficacy have not been evaluated by any regulatory authority.U.S. FDA-approved Indications Libtayo is a prescription medicine used to treat people with:A type of skin cancer called advanced CSCC that has spread or cannot be cured by surgery or radiation.A type of skin cancer called BCC:A type of lung cancer called NSCLC. Libtayo may be used as your first treatment when your lung cancer has not spread outside your chest (locally advanced lung cancer) and you cannot have surgery or chemotherapy with radiation, or your lung cancer has spread to other areas of your body (metastatic lung cancer), and your tumor tests positive for high ""PD-L1"" and your tumor does not have an abnormal ""EGFR"", ""ALK ""or ""ROS1"" gene.It is not known if Libtayo is safe and effective in children.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies.

REGN recently announced that its supplemental biologics license application (sBLA) for the ophthalmology drug, Eylea (aflibercept), has been accepted by the FDA for priority review. Eylea is a VEGF inhibitor formulated as an injection for the eye.The sBLA is seeking label expansion of Eylea for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in preterm infants.With the FDA granting a priority review to the sBLA, a decision from the regulatory body is expected on Feb 11, 2023.The latest sBLA was based on data from two phase III studies – FIREFLEYE and BUTTERFLEYE – which evaluated Eylea (0.4 mg) compared to laser photocoagulation (laser) in infants with ROP, a leading cause of childhood blindness in the world.Data from both studies showed that 80% of infants treated with Eylea achieved an absence of both active ROP and unfavorable structural outcomes at 52 weeks of age.However, both studies did not meet the primary endpoint of non-inferiority as laser demonstrated comparable levels of efficacy, which was higher than what has been historically observed in similar ROP studies.While Regeneron is the lead sponsor of the BUTTERFLEYE study, Bayer AG BAYRY is the lead sponsor of the FIREFLEYE study.The FDA granted orphan drug designation to Eylea for the treatment of ROP in July 2019.Shares of Regeneron have risen 15.3% so far this year against the industry’s decline of 27.8%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRegeneron is jointly developing Eylea with Bayer.While Regeneron records net product sales of Eylea in the United States, Bayer records net product sales of the drug outside the United States. Regeneron records its share of profits/losses in connection with sales of Eylea outside the United States.Eylea injection (2mg) is approved for treating patients with neovascular (Wet) age-related macular degeneration, macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema, and diabetic retinopathy.Story continuesSales of Eylea in the United States came in at $3.1 billion in the first six months of 2022. Successful label expansion into additional indications should boost sales further in the days ahead.However, stiff competition from new treatment options remains an overhang.Zacks Rank &amp; Other Stocks to ConsiderRegeneron currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. Specifically, we decided to study Regeneron Pharmaceuticals'  ROE in this article.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is:27% = US$5.7b ÷ US$21b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.27 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Earnings Growth And 27% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has a significantly high ROE. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 23% the company's ROE is quite impressive. As a result, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' exceptional 38% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise.As a next step, we compared Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 21%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is REGN worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether REGN is currently mispriced by the market.Is Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Regeneron Pharmaceuticals doesn't pay any dividend currently which essentially means that it has been reinvesting all of its profits into the business. This definitely contributes to the high earnings growth number that we discussed above.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

If you want to read about some more industrial dividend stocks, go directly to 5 Best Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy Now.The industrial sector has been dealing with the twin pressures of labor shortages and supply chain disruptions as macro uncertainties like inflation and rising rates batter the economy. According to a report by research firm Deloitte, there is likely to be a shortfall of 2.1 million skilled jobs by 2030. This environment has kept the optimism around revenue growth in the sector in check even as the economic recovery in the post-pandemic world gathers pace with the lifting of virus restrictions and the resumption of international travel. Another important factor influencing growth in the industrial space is the challenges to transportation that are likely to continue beyond 2022. Some of these include driver shortages in trucking and congestion at US container ports. As demand outpaces supply, higher costs are more likely to be passed on to customers, per Deloitte. However, an acceleration in digital technology adoption could bring operational efficiencies to scale in this regard. Sustainability initiatives are also important and factoring into cost of capital. Investors who want to look for solid companies with reliable dividend track records to ride the upcoming market storm should invest in some of the best industrial stocks like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM). Research firm RSM US claims that investments in resilient supply chains and digital tech, in light of geopolitical tensions and rising inflation, will be the two most important trends shaping the future of the industrial world.Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the industrial sector and have solid dividend profiles were selected for the list. The firms with dividend yields above 1.5% as of October 13 and a more than 10-year track record of payouts were preferred. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.Story continues10 Best Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy NowChristian Lagerek/Shutterstock.comBest Industrial Dividend Stocks To Buy Now10. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33      Dividend Yield as of October 13: 2.72%Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) engages in the wholesale distribution of industrial and construction supplies. It is one of the best industrial stocks to invest in. Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST)'s near-term revenue growth should benefit from healthy demand in the commodity-related and capital goods markets. With the opening of onsite locations and the installation of FMIs, the long-term growth prospects for the company look solid as well.On July 15, Argus analyst John Eade kept a Buy rating on Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) stock and lowered the price target to $55 from $66, noting that the company’s core business trends remained positive.At the end of the second quarter of 2022, 33 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $893 million in Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST), compared to 29 the preceding quarter worth $1 billion.Just like Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) is one of the best industrial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. In its Q2 2021 investor letter, Nomadic Value Partners, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“In mid-June we completely sold out of Fastenal Company (NASDAQ:FAST). Although we had been using FAST as a source of liquidity for a few months already, it still feels bad to say an official goodbye to such an amazing company. However, we must stay focused on the math and the math concludes a difficult task to get our return hurdle going forward. The last time FAST traded at a forward P/E ratio of 34x (the multiple at our exit), the year was 2012. The company had been growing at 20% per year, and the US was about to embark on a shale oil boom, sustaining a low-teens growth trajectory. Today, FAST’s sales growth could turn anemic as the surge for COVID safety products is waning and heavy construction and resources customers are slow to return. An investor must have an optimistic view towards 5+ years of strong real GDP growth as well as sustained inflation. If one lowers the growth assumption to a more likely outcome, then the implicit bet is that low to negative real interest rates will persist and the forward P/E multiple will stay elevated4. I do not want to make such a strong macro bet as the justification for owning a stock. Fastenal is a cyclical business with a growth model proven to take market share secularly, but the time to buy FAST (the stock) will be when we are in the depths of an industrial recession. Stay tuned.”9. Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33  Dividend Yield as of October 13: 2.83%Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) provides atmospheric gases, process and specialty gases, equipment, and services worldwide. It is one of the top industrial stocks to invest in. Air Products and Chemicals, Inc.

(NYSE:APD) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“This quarter we are highlighting Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. (NYSE:APD) as a relative yield example in the Materials sector. APD is a leading global industrial gas supply company and is the largest supplier of hydrogen and helium in the world. It has a sustainable competitive advantage due to long-term customer relationships and contracts, high customer switching costs, and the mission critical nature of its products. Industrial gases are a relatively small fraction of customers’ overall costs but are crucial to ensure uninterrupted production.Our thesis on APD is that it appears well-positioned for consistent double-digit growth due to a large multi-year capital allocation plan, and the need for accelerating capital expenditures by its customers. It has a $25 billion backlog driven by traditional gas investments along with new growth opportunities like gasification, green hydrogen, and carbon capture. APD’s gasification technologies help improve energy efficiency and independence, which is a key focus for its customers. The company also has a strong management team with a record of expanding margins and exemplary capital allocation.""8. Republic Services, Inc.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on October 20. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis railroad is expected to post quarterly earnings of $3.07 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +19.5%.Revenues are expected to be $6.48 billion, up 16.5% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.18% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Union Pacific?For Union Pacific, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.86%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Union Pacific will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Union Pacific would post earnings of $2.82 per share when it actually produced earnings of $2.93, delivering a surprise of +3.90%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Union Pacific doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more industrial stocks, go directly to 5 Best Industrial Stocks To Buy Now.The United States economy in 2022 has not been as vibrant as 2021. In fact, soaring inflation and rising interest rates have combined to raise recession fears and resulted in a broad selloff at the stock market, pushing down benchmark indexes and turning investors away from even value-oriented sectors such as financials, industrials, materials and energy. However, as travel demand picks up again, inflation cools down, and infrastructure spending ramps up, industrial stocks in particular seem well-positioned to make a strong comeback. Some of the best industrial stocks to buy in this context include TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM). Another catalyst for industrial stocks is the Russian war in Ukraine that has led to increased defense spending around the world. A quick solution to the war seems increasingly unlikely. Thus, aerospace and defense stocks are poised to outperform the broader industry in the coming months. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the industrial sector were selected for the list. In order to provide readers with some context for their investment choices, the business fundamentals and analyst ratings for the stocks are also discussed. Data from around 900 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022 was used to identify the number of hedge funds that hold stakes in each firm.13 Best Industrial Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Lenny Kuhne on UnsplashBest Industrial Stocks To Buy Now13. Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 34    Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) manufactures and sells industrial products and equipment worldwide. It is one of the best industrial stocks to invest in. On August 24, Bank of America analyst Andrew Obin reinstated coverage of Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) stock with a Neutral rating and a $220 price target, stressing that the rating balances an improving long-term story with near-term macro headwinds.Story continuesAt the end of the second quarter of 2022, 34 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $366 million in Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW), compared to 36 in the previous quarter worth $426 million.Just like TransDigm Group Incorporated (NYSE:TDG), Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP), and 3M Company (NYSE:MMM), Illinois Tool Works Inc. (NYSE:ITW) is one of the best industrial stocks to buy now according to hedge funds. 12. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35 Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) manufactures and sells motion and control technologies and systems for various mobile, industrial, and aerospace markets worldwide. It is one of the top industrial stocks to invest in. Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) on September 16 sold its Aircraft Wheel and Brake Division, located in Avon, to Kaman Corporation. Aircraft Wheel &amp; Brake has been a trusted provider of mission-critical wheel and brake technology products and solutions for more than 80 years. On October 03, Barclays analyst Julian Mitchell kept an Overweight rating on Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH) stock and lowered the price target to $320 from $340.

Here is what the fund said:“Parker-Hannifin Corporation (NYSE:PH), a U.S. company that specializes in motion and control technologies, is suffering from what we believe are investor misunderstandings and misjudgements, despite the efforts of the company’s unusually strong management team. In our opinion, since his promotion in 2015, CEO Thomas Williams has vastly improved operations and shifted the product portfolio to longer cycled, higher growth, higher margin and higher return end markets. The results are impressive. Margins, returns and earnings have increased substantially. With the expected closing of the Meggitt acquisition in the September quarter, the highly depressed aerospace segment will be its largest end market. We anticipate a rebound in aerospace revenue, which—combined with the company’s strong position in attractive businesses, including clean technologies and factory automation—should accelerate revenue growth. Parker Hannifin trades at a discount to other high-quality industrials, which we believe is unwarranted since its growth and returns should be similar or better. At a low-teens multiple of next year’s normalized cash earnings, Parker Hannifin is an attractive investment, in our view.”11. Cummins Inc. (NYSE:CMI) Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 36   Cummins Inc.

The Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge is an online competition that awards cash prizes to early-stage tech entrepreneurs solving the world's toughest problems. Since 2017, the competition has awarded $3.25 million USD to 78 start-ups from 25 countries.We are excited for you to learn more about the 2022 winning teams addressing some of the biggest challenges we face through technology-based solutions.In response to the growing urgency to reverse climate change, we introduced five new Climate Impact and Regeneration prizes totaling $300,000 USD. These prizes recognize solutions that can reduce or remove greenhouse gas (GHG) from the environment or regenerate depleted ecosystems.Meet Unergy, a start-up based out of Colombia that won a $50,000 USD Climate Impact &amp; Regeneration Runner-Up Prize. Their solution assists companies and organizations that are looking to convert to clean energy, but find it cost-prohibitive, by providing an easy platform for them to connect with investors who are eager to fund clean energy projects in developing markets.I sat down with Eduardo Ospina, the CEO and co-founder of Unergy, and Natalia Isaza, Unergy's Chief Content Officer. They shared how they are trying to democratize the fight against climate change, how Unergy thrived during the pandemic, and their passion for marrying technology and sustainability.What problem is your technology solution trying to solve? Can you explain how the solution works?Eduardo: I think the biggest work for humanity right now is the fight against climate change. Currently, the world needs more than $2.4 trillion of investment into clean energy to avoid a climate disaster. However, even with all the work that is being done around the world today, the current level of investment only amounts to about 30 percent of that number.Story continuesWe have seen that, in Latin America, and in other emerging markets, there is a big necessity for liquidity to finance clean energy projects. For example, solar energy has a high return rate and good metrics to become a reality, but organizations have been unable to afford it. Frequently, companies that say they want to invest in clean energy find that investment costs are too high.On the other hand, we see a lot of people like us at Unergy that have the liquidity and the desire to finance clean energy projects, but don't have an easy way to do it. So, Unergy joins these two different groups to solve the problem by connecting organizations who want to invest in clean energy with people to put money into their projects. It allows us to democratize and decentralize energy. For example, with Unergy, someone located in the United States or elsewhere will be able to invest in clean energy projects for companies in Latin America or in other emerging markets.Natalia: Through our technology, we allow any person to be a part of supporting energy transformation around the world. We allow the opportunity for people to spend money on clean energy not just in Colombia, but everywhere.What inspired you to develop this solution?Eduardo: I started the company with my two partners, Nicolás and Paola. We started Unergy because we were trying for some years to sell solar energy to companies, but we ultimately realized that the biggest barrier-and the biggest necessity-for clean energy is financing. From there, we decided that rather than selling clean energy products, we would help finance them and help connect others who want to finance clean energy with companies that need the money.We are a pandemic company. We were working on the idea about a year beforehand, but we officially started in March 2020 just when the pandemic began. That ended up being a very good thing. Before the pandemic, companies used to have more liquidity for projects and didn't think a lot about different types of financial organization. Since the pandemic, companies have started to really think about how they can save and how they could be more sustainable. Unergy is the best fit for that because we are offering savings. We are offering sustainability. So, I think it was a very good moment for us to open.Natalia: I joined Unergy later. I was hired to improve some processes in communication and marketing, and I just really believed in the idea. I connected with the mission and vision of the company, and I just fell in love with the idea that we could help provide clean energy to anybody.What is innovative about the way you are solving the issue? What sets your solution apart?Eduardo: I think that it's relatively normal for those with lots of funding to want to invest in clean energy. What is unique about Unergy is that we dream about the democratization and decentralization of clean energy. For example, in Latin America, three big players are the owners of all of the energy in those countries. What is important to us is not just financing clean energy projects, but also allowing for retail investors and people from around the world to invest.How will winning a prize in the Cisco Global Problem Solver Challenge help you advance your business?Eduardo: We are expanding right now into Brazil, and into European countries that need more investment in clean energy. The more we expand, we will be able to achieve a bigger impact, so we will be using all of the money on international expansion and sharing our goal of decreasing the $2.4 trillion in investment needed to combat climate change.What advice do you have for other social entrepreneurs?Eduardo: I think you have to cross your personal motivations with the goal of the company. Personally, I love what I do. I love to be here, I love to travel, and I love to dedicate my life to solving this issue because I really do want to make a huge difference in the world. Since I was young, I've been passionate about inventing things, about sustainability, about energy and electricity. Then, when I was in University, I realized that it wasn't just about inventing things; it was about inventing things with a purpose and inventing things with the ambition that it could impact the world in a very positive way. I think being an entrepreneur is very hard for a lot of people, but if you can enjoy the challenges you have to face to grow, and if you can enjoy the things you do, it is better.Natalia: If you can mix knowledge of the continuous update of technology with the desire to solve social or environmental problems, you will be the best company that can impact the most people. I agree with Eduardo that you must connect your personal dreams with the vision and mission of the company. And if you want to be here and continue here and be motivated, you have to be ready to learn every day. I want to do something for the world and for people, and I love to connect sustainability with technology.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/720319/Unergy-How-a-Platform-Allows-Anyone-To-Invest-in-and-Consume-Clean-Energy]"

Research by consulting firm Gartner noted that the number of businesses that use IoT technologies had increased from 13% in 2014 to nearly 30% by the end of 2020. Across the world, the use of IoT-connected devices is projected to increase to 43 billion by 2023, an almost threefold increase from 2018. Conservative estimates place the worth of the IoT businesses to be around $58 billion in 2025. This represents a compound annual growth rate of an explosive 34% from 2020. Some of the top firms expected to benefit from this incredible opportunity include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc.

The North American region continues to lead this tech revolution, even as a slower-than-anticipated overall economic recovery, a lack of chipsets, and disrupted supply chains present near-term challenges to the growth of the sector.
