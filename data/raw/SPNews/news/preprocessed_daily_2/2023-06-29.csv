We should remain humble about how risks can arise and continue our work to ensure that banks are resilient to a range of economic scenarios, market shocks, and other stresses.""Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Results did vary widely across the industry, however. The bank with the highest capital ratio under the Fed’s “severely adverse scenario” was Charles Schwab (SCHW), one of the lenders that came under a lot of investor scrutiny earlier this year as other banks stumbled.The bank with the lowest ratio was Citizens Financial (CFG), a regional bank based in Rhode Island. Other regional banks such as US Bancorp (USB) and Truist also ended the test with smaller buffers than their giant rivals.But the giants of the industry also posted the biggest projected net income losses under the Fed’s “severely adverse scenario,” led by Citigroup's $34.9 billion. Wells Fargo had $32.9 billion and JPMorgan had $30.1 billion.Story continuesGoldman, perhaps the most storied name on Wall Street, had the highest amount of estimated losses from commercial estate loans and credit cards.It also recorded the highest losses in separate Fed assessments of how the trading books of the biggest banks would perform under “global and exploratory market shocks.”Tougher rulesThe Fed’s test, an annual rite of the industry since the 2008 financial crisis, is the first to be released since turmoil roiled the banking world following the failure of First Republic, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank this spring.Banks typically use the results of the annual Fed stress tests to determine how much they should have on their balance sheet to absorb shocks and how much they have left over for dividends and buybacks. Some banks are expected to make announcements late Friday about how much money they now plan to return to shareholders.But banks are also bracing for a new set of higher capital requirements from the Fed that will force some of them to hold even greater buffers against losses.These tougher rules were already in the works before the collapse of several regional banks in the spring, but regulators made it clear in the wake of those troubles that they wanted to make sure their new approach applied to mid-sized institutions similar in size to a First Republic or a Silicon Valley Bank. Both had more than $200 billion in assets at the time of their failures.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week he does not expect smaller community banks to be subject to the higher capital requirements, which are expected to be proposed sometime this summer. Institutions with at least $100 billion in assets may have to comply.Forcing banks to amass greater buffers has pros and cons for lenders, regulators, and the economy. It will increase the stability of these institutions, but it will also make it more difficult to earn robust profits and could cause banks to pull back on certain types of lending.Powell discussed this balance last week.“It’s always a trade-off,” he said. “More capital means more stable, resilient banking systems. It can also at the margins mean less credit availability…there is no perfect way to assess that balance.”Barr, the vice chair of supervision, said last week the Fed is also exploring ""reverse stress testing"" that could be used as a tool to make banks more resilient by helping supervisors recognize more exogenous issues that could go wrong instead of patterns from the past regulators have been trained to catch.Meeting a testThe Fed first started applying stress tests to a wide group of banks in 2009 as the last financial crisis was still raging.It was mandated annually by law for institutions with more than $100 billion in assets as part of legislation that passed in 2010. A law passed in 2018 tailored the tests by banks’ size, meaning those in the range of $100 billion-$250 billion would be tested every other year.Democrats and regulators have been critical of that 2018 adjustment, arguing it could have helped prevent the problems that amassed at Silicon Valley Bank, which had not been subjected to a stress test before it failed.Silicon Valley Bank was seized by regulators on March 10. REUTERS/Brittany Hosea-Small (Brittany Hosea-Small / reuters)Some in this year's test — BMO Financial, Citizens, M&amp;T, and RBC US Group — were among the every-other-year banks that weren’t scheduled to be tested again until 2024.But the Fed required BMO, Citizens, and M&amp;T to be tested again in 2023, and RBC also opted in to the 2023 exam. All four banks had capital of 6.4% and higher, above the 4.5% required.This year the Fed examined how 23 banks would fare under a severe global recession that included severe stress in commercial real estate. In such a scenario unemployment spikes to 10%, home prices and commercial real estate plunge about 40%, the stock market plummets 45%, market volatility jumps and corporate bond yields rise.All 23 banks in aggregate would have lost $541 billion. Yet they would still have capital equal to 10.1% of total assets weighted by risk. Well above the 4.5% the Fed requires.The biggest lossesThe $541 billion in total projected losses includes more than $100 billion from commercial real estate and residential mortgages and $120 billion in credit card losses, both higher than the losses projected in last year’s test.The banks with the biggest commercial real estate losses were Goldman, with $16 billion, followed by Morgan Stanley ($13.7 billion) and Citizens ($12.4 billion).Goldman also had the highest credit card losses, with $24.7 billion, followed by Capital One ($22.2 billion) and TD Group ($21.4 billion).Goldman Sachs headquarters, at right. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Eight banks with large trading operations were also tested against a ""global market shock"" tied to their trading positions. For the first time, this year's test also tested the trading books of those banks against a second ""exploratory market shock.""The Fed said the global market shock was a severe recession with fading inflation expectations; the exploratory market shock tested a less severe recession with greater inflationary pressures.The results from those exams showed that the trading books of the largest banks were resilient amid a rising rate environment.The biggest projected losses belonged to Goldman, with $21.2 billion lost in the global market shock scenario and $18.1 billion in the exploratory market shock component.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

3,8e793489-7b79-3c0b-b545-f230a8a55e6a,TXN,2023-06-29,10 Semiconductor Stocks To Watch During A Potential Tech Pullback,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-semiconductor-stocks-watch-during-135743482.html,1687960663,STORY,"['INTC', 'TXN', 'SWKS', 'MU', 'NVDA', 'AVGO', 'AMD']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at 10 semiconductor stocks to watch during a potential tech pullback. To see more of these stocks, you can go directly to see the 5 Semiconductor Stocks To Watch During A Potential Tech Pullback.Tech Rally Or Tech Pullback?As the month of June draws to a close, the financial markets are beginning to get concerned about the tech rally that has been taking the S&amp;P 500 by storm so far this year. Many professionals have begun stating that a tech pullback may be fast approaching, which is beginning to scare off investors with billions locked in tech stocks. On June 27, Alex Kantrowitz, Big Technology Founder, was invited on CNBC to share his thoughts on the future of tech stocks in the second half of 2023 in light of these concerns.Kantrowitz noted that the valuations of several tech stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), have been skyrocketing so far this year, even as interest rates also continue to rise. At the time of his interview, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was trading at $410.02. According to Kantrowitz, one way to view such rising valuations is to ask why nothing so far has managed to stop them from continuing their upwards progress. On the other hand, one can also consider the fact that most big tech companies are seeing significant multiple expansions in 2023. Kantrowitz commented that these bigger multiples signal that there is a chance of there being a tech pullback. Here are some of his comments from the interview:""Fundamentally, you look at it, it makes you a little nervous. Then you also say 'what's the market done until now?' It's kept buying.""Kantrowitz's comments truly highlight how many investors are approaching the rising tensions within the tech sector amid concerns of a pullback. While experience and fundamentals may signal to them that a pullback may be on the horizon, most are unable to truly consider this possibility considering the market's continuing optimism surrounding the tech sector. Later in the interview, Kantrowitz offers some insights into what has been helping the tech industry maintain its momentum until now. In his eyes, the narrative surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), particularly after the launch of ChatGPT, has been mostly carrying the tech stocks. He noted the following:Story continues""We've seen this run-up in tech stocks and it's largely been based on an AI narrative. The narrative that we start talking to computers, they start talking back to us, all of a sudden the narrative is that it's gonna change the world. And it very well might. But what's happened since the introduction of ChatGPT? There's been a lot of cool consumer experiments, or prototypes. But have we seen the one or two market-changing, world-changing applications that's made everything that you do different the same way that the iPhone did? Because that's basically what the market is betting. We haven't seen it.""According to Kantrowitz, the above spells out danger for the tech industry. He believes that if the narrative surrounding AI changes from the market considering it as a ""world-changing"" technology to just considering it as a ""cool"" technology, this would be ""bad news"" for both the tech industry and the market at large.How Tech Pullback Concerns Are Impacting Stocks In The SectorSeveral stocks in the tech industry have begun feeling the market's uncertainty in light of more discussions surrounding a potential pullback. On June 26, CNBC briefly showed how several semiconductor stocks, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), had actually declined for the day in light of these concerns by 8% and 9%, respectively. These stocks are among the best semiconductor stocks in 2023, as we mentioned in one of our previous articles. However, the changing market dynamics are signaling that investors should begin monitoring them more closely at this time. Additionally, it may also be wise to look closely at undervalued semiconductor stocks and the fastest-growing semiconductor companies at this time.At the same time, on June 27, CNBC's TechCheck showed how pullback concerns have begun heating up AI deals, leading to more companies jumping into partnerships and acquisitions. Examples include the recent partnership between NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) and the $1.3 billion acquisition of MosaicML by Databricks. It was also noted that while these deals are beginning to heat up, several tech stocks are beginning to lose their gains heading into the last week of June.The discussion above implies that while the tech industry is continuing to hold on, there are many stocks within it that investors should begin inspecting more closely. It may also be a good idea to begin monitoring the performance of semiconductor stocks, which began falling on June 26, to ensure that tech investors are not taken by surprise if a pullback does come about. In light of the uncertainty in the market today, we have compiled a list of some semiconductor stocks to watch as the situation develops further.10 Semiconductor Stocks To Watch During A Potential Tech PullbackPhoto by Slejven Djurakovic on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo compile our list below, we selected semiconductor stocks that were popular among hedge funds during the first quarter of 2023 by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for that quarter.

This year, the stock market has experienced a shift in investing style as growth stocks are reasserting their dominance over dividend stocks. However, this does not indicate that dividend stocks have lost their appeal as income generation and compounding growth continue to be the prime focus of investors this year as well.Evaluating the growth rate of dividends over multiple years can provide an understanding of the contribution of dividend stocks to long-term wealth creation. Increasing dividends mean shareholders receive larger cash payments over time. This growing income stream can be particularly beneficial for individuals who rely on dividend income for living expenses or as a source of regular cash flow. Moreover, companies that raise their payouts regularly have outperformed the market historically. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 consecutive years of dividend increases, has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by over 75% since 1989. Some of the best long-term stocks in this regard are Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).Also read: 14 Best Stocks for Long Term GrowthAnalysts have expressed a positive view of dividend stocks and exchange-traded funds in 2023 because of their long-term impact on returns. They believe that dividend funds are a safer choice because they invest in companies that have strong financial positions and healthy cash flows. These factors make them more likely to withstand economic downturns and remain resilient. Christopher Huemmer, senior vice president at FlexShares Exchange Traded Funds, highlighted the significance of dividend stocks while speaking with Reuters in April. He said:Story continues""Though we have experienced periods where the capital appreciation of a stock’s price has dwarfed the return from dividend income, the power of dividends should not be overlooked as a crucial component of equity performance.""He further stated:""In volatile markets, dividends can act like the keel of a sailboat, providing a level of stable return in choppy seas.""The historical evidence consistently supports the substantial contribution of dividend stocks to overall market returns. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we reported Hartford Fund’s data, which showed that dividend income represented 41% of the S&amp;P 500’s total return on average from 1930 to 2022. We also reported that from 2000 to 2009, the S&amp;P 500 experienced negative returns due to the dot-com bubble burst in March 2000. Despite this, dividends provided a positive annualized return of 1.8% during that period. The fact that dividend income has accounted for a considerable portion of the S&amp;P 500's total return emphasizes the significance of dividends for long-term investors, who prioritize generating regular cash flow from their investments.12 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and selected companies that have raised their dividends for 15 consecutive years or more.

(NYSE: ARE), the first, preeminent, longest-tenured and pioneering owner, operator and developer of collaborative life science, agtech and advanced technology campuses in AAA innovation cluster locations, has been at the vanguard of Greater Boston's thriving life science ecosystem since 1997. As the pioneer of mission-critical Labspace® real estate, Alexandria has a dominant market presence in Greater Boston — the world's top life science cluster — consisting of 19.6 million RSF, with 11.2 million RSF of operating properties as of March 31, 2023. Its Greater Boston asset base is home to over 10 multinational pharmaceutical companies, such as Eli Lilly and Novartis; innovative public biotechnology companies, such as Moderna and Alnylam; and top-tier, investment-grade institutions, such as MIT and Boston Children's Hospital. Alexandria's most prominent market presence is in Cambridge's Kendall Square, which features three of the country's foremost, in-demand Alexandria mega campuses. From this base of Greater Boston mega campuses, the company expanded into the adjacent high-value, high-barrier-to-entry submarkets of Watertown and Fenway. In Fenway, Alexandria pioneered a new life science submarket in 2021 with the creation of the Alexandria Center® for Life Science – Fenway mega campus. This foundational campus, developed in partnership with Samuels &amp; Associates, boasts a wealth of amenities, critical proximity to both Cambridge and the Longwood Medical Area, and their world-renowned medical research institutions, as well as convenient transportation access to help the campus's tenants attract and retain top talent.Among the tenants at the Alexandria Center for Life Science – Fenway is the company's long-term strategic partner Boston Children's Hospital, which invests heavily in basic, clinical and translational research to accelerate the discovery of new treatments for devastating diseases and to improve the health of both children and adults. In fiscal year 2022, Boston Children's was #1 in National Institutes of Health (NIH) funding among all U.S. children's hospitals. Government support for life science research remains strong with an NIH budget of $47.5 billion for fiscal year 2023. Academic and medical research institutions, which represent a key bedrock sector of Alexandria's high-quality and diverse client base of over 850 tenants, compose 12% of the company's annual rental revenue as of March 31, 2023. Additionally, 49% of Alexandria's total annual rental revenue as of March 31, 2023 is from investment-grade or publicly traded large cap tenants.Story continuesAlexandria continues its strong and timely execution of its successful value harvesting and asset recycling self-funding strategy with a signed purchase and sale agreement for the disposition of property that will constitute 268,000 RSF in 421 Park Drive, a 660,034 RSF Class A development, to an affiliate of Boston Children's Hospital. 421 Park Drive is a highly sustainable state-of-the-art laboratory development that has been designed to significantly enhance the foundational campus and surrounding neighborhood through the addition of new open space, direct connections to the MBTA Fenway station, bicycle and pedestrian paths, and retail destinations on the building's ground floor. Alexandria will develop the facility, operate the entire building and manage the more than 2 million RSF highly amenitized life science mega campus. This transaction results in 48.5% of the building being committed, including ground-floor retail. Initial proceeds at closing are estimated at $155 million, along with development fees to be earned by Alexandria over the next three years. Boston Children's will continue to fund its pro rata share of the costs to develop 421 Park Drive, which is expected to commence vertical construction later this year and be substantially complete in 2026. Initial proceeds from this transaction will be reinvested into the company's highly leased value-creation pipeline. As of March 31, 2023, 6.7 million RSF of current and near-term projects that are 72% leased are expected to generate more than $610 million of annual incremental net operating income, primarily commencing from 2Q23 through 1Q26. This embedded growth enabled Alexandria to reiterate guidance of 6.4% annual growth in funds from operations per share – diluted, as adjusted, for 2023 at the midpoint of guidance as of April 24, 2023, with a strong adjusted EBITDA margin of 69% for 1Q23.""This creative, strategic sale of 268,000 RSF of cutting-edge research space within our 421 Park life science development further illustrates the demand for our unique, mission-critical mega campus assets in high-barrier-to-entry markets and is a testament to the collaborative vibrancy of our Fenway mega campus,"" said Hunter L. Kass, executive vice president and regional market director of Greater Boston at Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. ""We value our longstanding trusted relationship with Boston Children's and proudly recognize their legacy of scientific discovery and innovation as a distinguished healthcare institution.""Innovation in medicine is a national imperative, and the opportunity to improve human health and save lives remains vast, with 10,000 diseases known to humankind, nearly 90% of which have no viable treatments. The life science industry has aggregate annual research and development funding in the range of $450 billion to $500 billion and is well positioned for continued secular growth. Alexandria's mission-critical Labspace assets, which house billions of dollars of irreplaceable tenant research and 24/7 high-intensity equipment, remain integral to supporting the advancement of life-changing and lifesaving treatments and cures.421 Park Drive (pictured above left) at the Alexandria Center® for Life Science – Fenway mega campus.

With 77% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$1.6b. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 27% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell U.S. Bancorp, which might have negative implications on individual investors.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of U.S. Bancorp. View our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About U.S. Bancorp?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.U.S. Bancorp already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at U.S. Bancorp's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. U.S. Bancorp is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 8.3%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.8% and 3.8%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of U.S. BancorpThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of U.S. Bancorp. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$100m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 23% stake in U.S. Bancorp. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand U.S. Bancorp better, we need to consider many other factors.

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) share price is up 86% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 52% (ignoring dividends).So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Edwards Lifesciences managed to grow its earnings per share at 23% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 13% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. But while CEO remuneration is always worth checking, the really important question is whether the company can grow earnings going forward. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Edwards Lifesciences' earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 14% in the last year, Edwards Lifesciences shareholders lost 5.8%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 13% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. If you would like to research Edwards Lifesciences in more detail then you might want to take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in the company.Story continuesIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

This is expected to be of great help to businesses, especially small ones.Notably, Business Prime Duo is an Amazon Business membership that used to cost $69 per year previously. It allows the business customers or the ones who buy for businesses to access business-only pricing and avail of free One and Two-Day Delivery and free Same-Day Delivery facilities.Moreover, Amazon Business with Business Prime Duo will help business owners save more and keep their personal and business expenses separate while enjoying Prime entertainment benefits and other perks.Additionally, business customers will be eligible to choose their own Amazon Day to receive orders on the same day every week.

Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote Move to BenefitWe believe the latest move will likely aid Amazon in attracting businesses, especially small business owners, to its platform.This, in turn, will boost the adoption of Prime membership as well as Amazon Business.Notably, the Prime program remains a key catalyst for AMZN’s top-line growth, backed by customer-friendly offers and cashback benefits. Further, strengthening delivery and shipment services and expanding music and video content, plus a robust loyalty system, are constantly boosting Amazon’s Prime subscriber base.All the benefits aid Amazon in delivering better shopping experiences to its Prime members.We believe the growing adoption of Prime will drive the company’s subscription revenues, which have been acting as key drivers for the e-commerce giant for the past few years.Amazon witnessed 15% growth in its subscription service sales, which were $9.7 billion in first-quarter 2023.Growing momentum across subscription services is expected to continue driving the company’s overall top-line growth.For 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $560.32 billion, reflecting growth of 9% from 2022.We believe that the strengthening financial performance of the company will likely raise investor optimism about the stock.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Last year was challenging for the overall stock market and particularly for growth stocks. On the other hand, dividend indexes and portfolios focused on dividends performed relatively well. Some even managed to achieve a small gain during that period. This year, the stock market has experienced a shift in investing style as growth stocks are reasserting their dominance over dividend stocks. However, this does not indicate that dividend stocks have lost their appeal as income generation and compounding growth continue to be the prime focus of investors this year as well.Evaluating the growth rate of dividends over multiple years can provide an understanding of the contribution of dividend stocks to long-term wealth creation. Increasing dividends mean shareholders receive larger cash payments over time. This growing income stream can be particularly beneficial for individuals who rely on dividend income for living expenses or as a source of regular cash flow. Moreover, companies that raise their payouts regularly have outperformed the market historically. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 consecutive years of dividend increases, has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by over 75% since 1989. Some of the best long-term stocks in this regard are Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).Also read: 14 Best Stocks for Long Term GrowthAnalysts have expressed a positive view of dividend stocks and exchange-traded funds in 2023 because of their long-term impact on returns. They believe that dividend funds are a safer choice because they invest in companies that have strong financial positions and healthy cash flows. These factors make them more likely to withstand economic downturns and remain resilient. Christopher Huemmer, senior vice president at FlexShares Exchange Traded Funds, highlighted the significance of dividend stocks while speaking with Reuters in April. He said:Story continues""Though we have experienced periods where the capital appreciation of a stock’s price has dwarfed the return from dividend income, the power of dividends should not be overlooked as a crucial component of equity performance.""He further stated:""In volatile markets, dividends can act like the keel of a sailboat, providing a level of stable return in choppy seas.""The historical evidence consistently supports the substantial contribution of dividend stocks to overall market returns. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we reported Hartford Fund’s data, which showed that dividend income represented 41% of the S&amp;P 500’s total return on average from 1930 to 2022. We also reported that from 2000 to 2009, the S&amp;P 500 experienced negative returns due to the dot-com bubble burst in March 2000. Despite this, dividends provided a positive annualized return of 1.8% during that period. The fact that dividend income has accounted for a considerable portion of the S&amp;P 500's total return emphasizes the significance of dividends for long-term investors, who prioritize generating regular cash flow from their investments.12 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and selected companies that have raised their dividends for 15 consecutive years or more.

Companies large and small are constantly undertaking shakeups in their business strategies and management teams as they seek a competitive edge in the marketplace. Long tenured CEO positions are becoming increasingly rare in the business world, particularly among publicly traded companies where shareholders demand results. To be sure, running a competitive and profitable company hasn’t gotten any easier in the last few years with a global pandemic, the highest rates of inflation in 40 years, interest rate hikes and the longest bear market in stocks since after World War II. With so much change underway, now may be the time to jump on these stocks to buy during corporate shakeups.Alibaba (BABA)The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the backgroundSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.comNews arrived very recently of a major executive shakeup at Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Markets were shocked when it was announced that Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang would step down to focus on the company’s cloud intelligence business and be replaced by Eddie Wu, a co-founder of the company who has long been involved in technology development. News of the executive change comes as Alibaba restructures into six separate business groups, representing the biggest reorganization in the company’s history.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlibaba is trying to aggressively boost its business amid an economic slowdown in China, and after the government in Beijing spent two years cracking down on the e-commerce concern, slapping it with a record $2.8 billion antitrust fine. While the restructuring and executive shakeup create some near-term uncertainty at Alibaba, it is still one of the top stocks to buy during corporate shakeups. Now especially looks to be an opportune time to buy BABA stock with it down 17% over the past year. Michael Burry, has been buying the stock in recent months, betting on a China rebound.Story continuesAdidas (ADDYY)Source: ShutterstockBjorn Gulden, who previously ran rival sneaker company Puma (OTCMKTS:PUMSY) for nearly a decade, assumed the CEO role at German footwear giant Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) at the start of this year. He replaced Kasper Rorsted, who had served as CEO of Adidas since 2016 and steered the global brand through the Covid-19 pandemic when its stores were closed and its supply chains thrown into disarray. In announcing the management shakeup, the board at Adidas said it is trying to “pave the way for a restart” at the 74-year-old company. In addition to the ravages of the pandemic, Adidas has also struggled due to its messy divorce from rapper Kanye West, whose Yeezy brand of sneakers had been a global bestseller for the company. But after severing ties with the controversial artist, Adidas found itself with millions of pairs of unsold Yeezy shoes sitting in warehouses around the world. Adidas has estimated that it is sitting on $1.3 billion of unsold Yeezy-branded sneakers. CEO Gulden decided to sell the Kanye West sneakers again and give a portion of the sales to charity.ADDYY stock is trending in the right direction, having gained 39% in 2023. However, the share price remains 44% lower than where it was trading at before the pandemic struck in March 2020.Under Armour (UAA)the exterior of an Under Armour storeSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAnother global sports apparel brand that has a new CEO is Under Armour (NYSE:UAA).

At Under Armor she has been tasked with helping to boost the company’s profile and better compete against rival brands such as Adidas.Indeed, Linnartz has called 2023 “a year of building for the brand.” How long it takes for Linnartz to execute a turnaround strategy at the company remains to be seen.

The report was produced by the consulting firm's think tank Oliver Wyman Forum in collaboration with Airports Council International (ACI World) and the Sustainable Tourism Global Center (STGC), a multinational coalition spearheaded by the Ministry of Tourism of Saudi Arabia. (PRNewsfoto/Oliver Wyman Forum)The report, entitled The Evolution of Airports: A Flight Path to 2050 identifies priorities and trends needed to ""future-proof"" operations and cut greenhouse gas emissions. Achieving net zero represents a key priority.Airports account for 2% to 5% of total aviation emissions, which represent approximately 2.5% of total carbon emissions globally. According to the report authors, airports will become energy hubs and producers that provide the alternative fuels needed to support aviation's efforts to reduce emissions. This will happen as airports simultaneously work to electrify their own ground transport and take other steps to work toward net zero. Meanwhile, biometrics and digital identities will transform the passenger experience, and artificial intelligence and 3D printing will improve the efficiency of airport operations. As part of this transition, today's approximately 11.3 million airport workers will need to develop a more specialized skillset in such applications as digital technology and cybersecurity. In addition, collaboration with public transit agencies will be required to pursue integrated, green-transit strategies.The report identifies four airport types and includes interviews with 18 airport chief executives from across these airport types to understand the megatrends shaping their future. Flight Path to 2050 presents case studies from four of today's airports around the world representing each of these types: Dubai International Airport represents ""Global Hub Connectors"", Memphis International Airport is an example of ""Cargo Gateways"", Geneva Airport represents ""City Airports"", and Uruguay's Carrasco International Airport is an example of ""Leisure Gateways.""Story continuesThe report was released today at the ACI EUROPE/WORLD Annual General Assembly, Conference and Exhibition. Rana Nawas, a partner in Oliver Wyman's Transportation and Services practice, will present the findings at the conference. ""Because airports are a critical enabler of the global economy, the aim of our report is to map out the biggest disruptors airports can expect, along with potential solutions for implementation by governments, airport leaders, and the air travel industry at large,"" Nawas said.Luis Felipe de Oliveira, ACI World Director General, said: ""We are thrilled to be launching The Evolution of Airports: A Flight Path to 2050 with our partners Oliver Wyman and the STGC. The future is not a distant horizon but something airports are creating daily to benefit travelers worldwide. This view-from-the-top report highlights the main trends shared by the world's leading airport CEOs as well as strategic guidance from participating organizations. The Evolution of Airports provides thoughtful insights into the future trends shaping the world's airports and offers stakeholders and regulators advice on how they can support the path forward for airports.""Her Excellency Gloria Guevara, Chief Special Advisor at the Ministry of Tourism of Saudi Arabia said: ""As airports plan their roadmaps to 2030 and beyond, they have the potential and opportunity to lead the aviation industry, and support the Travel &amp; Tourism sector to accelerate the reduction of emissions and transition to net zero. We have witnessed a number of airports achieving climate neutrality already; and more can join. Indeed, airports are a crucial backbone of the sector and their leadership is instrumental to the future of the sector and its fight against climate change. The development and deployment of new technologies, including data and digital identity, at airports also heralds the potential to create traveler centric experiences whilst reducing emissions and costs, increasing efficiencies, and improving the health of the planet.""About the Oliver Wyman ForumThe Oliver Wyman Forum is dedicated to building leadership communities to act on shared global challenges.

We all understand. But ground transportation is more important than air in most jurisdictions and destinations and for a broader number of travelers.”Hornbuckle was partly talking out of self-interest in an interview with Skift. MGM’s dozen properties along the Strip would benefit if roadways like Interstate-15 into Las Vegas improved. Yet Hornbuckle also made a bigger picture point that affects tourism nationwide, and he spoke as chairman of the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Travel and Tourism Advisory Board.Hornbuckle cautioned that he’s not asking for more spending. He said he instead wants ground transportation to claim its fair share of already approved budget money. He said upwards of $110 billion out of about $550 billion in federal money for infrastructure could be tapped in ways that ultimately benefit tourism.Before the pandemic, a U.S. Transportation Department commission pinpointed about 100 roads, railways, and bridges needing improvement to support tourism nationwide — with about 15 deemed essential.Hornbuckle cited one example in Massachusetts: the Sagamore and Bourne bridges that connect Cape Cod with the rest of Massachusetts. These 90-year-old bridges need repair, he said. If they fail, tourism may dry up in much of the Cape.Hornbuckle believes the country is taking the slow road to highway rehabilitation primarily because of process issues, not money. He cited the example of the aging Interstate 73, which was supposed to connect Michigan to Myrtle Beach. Money has been earmarked for decades but work on it has never started, he said.“It’s about focus and prioritization,” Hornbuckle said, claiming that agencies and stakeholders aren’t coordinating.Story continues“I went to the secretary of transportation trying to get them to reconvene the committee,” Hornbuckle said. “They’ve agreed to open the topic back up. So I want to push my industry colleagues to contact the Department of Transportation to advocate for relevant projects.”In December, the U.S. finally got a secretary-level position for tourism. Yet Congress hasn’t funded the position, preventing the appointment of the first Assistant Secretary of Travel and Tourism at the U.S. Department of Commerce.“We’ve got to get some funding and get a body in there,” Hornbuckle said. “The undersecretary could appoint a designee to address the subject of tourism as it overlaps between Commerce and Transportation. To the extent we can get those two agencies communicating with each other in a real way — versus people like us from the outside trying to thread conversations — it’d be very meaningful.”Hornbuckle’s comments echo similar ones made by Chris Nassetta, CEO of Hilton and national chair of the U.S. Travel Association, earlier this year.That said, the project dearest to Hornbuckle’s heart is the one affecting Vegas, near his MGM hotels and casinos. Interstate 15 is the route about 10 million travelers take every year from Southern California to visit Las Vegas. Congestion often pushes a 3½-hour-trip into a longer stretch. Drivers during the recent late-May Memorial Day holiday faced a 12-mile backup, reported the Las Vegas Review-Journal.More U.S. Infrastructure NewsHilton CEO Says U.S. Government Needs to Act to Help TourismIn a Huge Win, U.S. to Finally Have a Secretary-Level Position for Tourism7 Questions for the U.S. State Department Official Out to Fix the Visa Delays Mess“Las Vegas is a pretty good representation of most travel destinations in that about half of our visitation comes via automobiles,” Hornbuckle said.During the May Memorial Day weekend, three times as many Americans traveled by car on trips longer than two hours than flew, according to AAA (American Automobile Association) estimates.“We all understand what happened to Southwest [Airlines] over the last year because of the country’s aging infrastructure, for instance,” Hornbuckle said. “But most people travel other ways. Our sector needs to speak up and get decision-makers focused.”Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

In 2023, the demand for coal will suffer due to lesser coal utilization in the United States to produce electricity, planned retirement of coal units and the utilization of more renewable sources for electricity generation. The ongoing energy transition, with utility operators steadily phasing out coal units, will adversely impact the coal industry. Then again, the persisting conflict between Russia and Ukraine is creating fresh demand from coal-importing countries. Hence, coal export from the United States is expected to improve in 2023 from the year-ago level.Despite a drop in coal production, improving cost export volumes and low-cost coal production assets are likely to boost the prospects of Warrior Met Coal. Other coal stocks, SunCoke Energy and Hallador Energy Company, are expected to gain during this difficult phase of the coal industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Coal industry comprises companies involved in the discovery and mining of coal. Coal is mined through the opencast or the underground method. The commodity is valued for its energy content and used worldwide to generate electricity and manufacture steel and cement. Per the U.S. Energy Information Administration (“EIA”) report, the current U.S. estimated recoverable coal reserves are about 252 billion short tons, of which, about 58% is underground mineable coal. Given the current production rates, coal resources are likely to last many more years.Five states in the United States contribute nearly 70% of the yearly production and 60% of the coal production from surface mining. Per EIA, the demand for coal will decline due to the usage of more renewable assets and a gradual shutdown of coal-powered generation units, hurting the prospects of the coal industry.Story continues3 Trends Likely to Impact the Coal IndustryDespite Reliability Emission Policy to Hurt Coal Industry: The improvement in demand for coal is short-lived as the new environmental policy will target 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035, which will significantly lower the demand for coal from the U.S. electricity space. Per EIA, coal-fired electricity generation would drop from 20% in 2022 to 16% in 2023 and remain the same in 2024. Unless utility operators invest heavily in pollution-control measures to reduce emissions from power plants, domestic coal usage will fall drastically.Coal industry operators should brace themselves for challenges as several electric utilities have decided to become carbon neutral by 2050 and completely cut down coal usage. Despite the emission, coal stocks are still relevant as the commodity is a reliable source of energy and ensures 24x7 electricity production from the generation units.U.S. Coal Production Drops: Per EIA projection, coal production in the United States is expected to drop in 2023 and 2024 after showcasing an improvement in production volumes in the previous two years. EIA projects U.S. coal production to decline by 6% to about 560 million short tons (MMst) in 2023 and a further 14% to 480 MMst in 2024 due to the expected reduction in coal usage in electricity production in the the United States. This would hurt coal operators as they fight a tough battle against other sources of energy.Coal to Benefit From Rising Exports: Despite an expected drop in the coal production volumes, coal operators in the United States can benefit from the expected rise in coal export volumes. Coal demand is expected to improve due to its economical pricing compared with other energy sources. Higher demand from the Asian market and an expected improvement in steel production should drive U.S. export volumes.Coal is still a viable energy option for many crucial industries across the globe. Per EIA, coal export volume may increase by 18.9% in 2023 to 100.8 MMst and by 2.6% more to 103.4 MMst in 2024. The World Steel Association forecasts a rebound in global steel volume production, rising 2.3% in 2023 to touch 1,822.3 Mt and up 1.7% in 2024 to touch 1,854 Mt.Steel production requires a lot of high-quality coal and nearly 70% of global steel production depends on coal. With the continued recovery in steel production, coal exports are expected to pick up and improve in the long run.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull ProspectsThe Zacks Coal industry is an 9-stock group within the broader Zacks Oil and Energy sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #246, which places it in the bottom 2% out of 251 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates lackluster performance in the near term. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s position in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures rose 30 cents, or 0.4%, to $69.86 a barrel.On Wednesday, both benchmarks gained about 3% after the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said crude inventories dropped by 9.6 million barrels in the week ended June 23, far exceeding the 1.8-million barrel draw analysts had forecast in a Reuters poll.""Crude traders remain torn between rising interest rates with fears of a global recession against elevated travel demand and shrinking crude supplies,"" said Dennis Kissler, senior vice president of trading at BOK Financial.Investors were concerned about rising interest rates and economic growth after Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell reiterated that he expects the moderate pace of interest rate decisions to continue in the coming months.The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week by the most in 20 months, offering an upbeat picture of the labor market that could encourage the Fed to keep raising interest rates.However, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic reiterated his belief that moderating inflation should keep the central bank from raising its short-term rate target again.European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde has cemented expectations for a ninth consecutive rise in euro zone rates in July.Financial stability risk in the European Union remains at a ""severe"" level and the downturn in the housing market could become even more broad-based, she added.Adding to pressure, annual profits at industrial firms in China, the world's second-biggest oil consumer, extended a double-digit decline in the first five months as softening demand squeezed margins.Story continues""The lack of prospects for fuel demand growth has limited the gain in oil prices, even with supply curbs by oil producers,"" said Tetsu Emori, CEO of Emori Fund Management Inc.Given falling prices, Saudi Arabia this month pledged to sharply cut its output in July, adding to a broader OPEC+ deal to limit supply into 2024.(Additional reporting by Ahmad Ghaddar in London,Yuka Obayashi; editing by Jason Neely, David Evans, Barbara Lewis, David Gregorio and Deepa Babington)]"

And it looks to triple that production and pump 1.2 million bpd by 2027.Story continuesThe government of Guyana wants to welcome more foreign operators to its already booming oil industry and economy and will hold its first-ever offshore licensing round in the middle of August as it finalizes a new model for Production and Sharing Agreements (PSA) and regulations that go with it.Supermajors Shell and Chevron, as well as Brazil’s state oil firm Petrobras, are reportedly among the ten companies considering bidding in the licensing round.Guyana, together with the United States and Brazil, is expected to lead oil production growth and capacity expansions from producers outside OPEC and the OPEC+ alliance this decade, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said in its annual Oil 2023 report with projections to 2028.Medium-term capacity expansion plans are expected to lead to a 5.1 million bpd supply boost from non-OPEC+ producers by 2028, with this increase led by the United States, Brazil, and Guyana.In comparison, all 23 current OPEC+ members will see a net capacity gain of 800,000 bpd by 2028, with capacity expansions in the biggest Middle Eastern producers – Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) – offset by declines in Russia, Africa, and Asia, the IEA said.As Guyana’s production grows, the country will become an increasingly influential market force outside OPEC’s control. But the Latin American country wants to generate oil revenues while it still can and capture a larger share of the market while global oil demand is still growing.“It sounds a bit crude to say our depletion policy is to get as much oil out of the ground as quickly as possible,” Vice President Jagdeo told the Journal.“We don’t want to be part of OPEC at this point in time.”By Tsvetana Paraskova for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:Energy Regulator Claims Canadian Oil Production Will Plunge 76% By 2050Sanctioned Goods Are Sneaking Into Russia Through KazakhstanEurope To Face Offshore Wind Tower Deficit By 2028Read this article on OilPrice.com]"

""Most of that will happen within a year, and then we're off to the races.""Among the issues is an investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York into Morgan Stanley's practices around block trading, or large sales of shares. The bank is in talks to resolve the probes, it said in a May filing.Story continuesBlock trades are typically placed by institutional investors. The investigations focus on whether the firm or its employees broke the law by sharing or using information about impending block transactions, it said in a February filing.Gorman also wants to deal with international regulations expected to be proposed this summer, the person said. The tougher rules could require major banks to hold as much as 20% more capital.Regulatory stress tests, another one of the outstanding matters, were clarified this week. Major banks aced the tests, according to results published on Wednesday, which showed big lenders have enough capital to weather a severe economic slump.SUCCESSION PLANNINGSince taking the helm, Australian-born Gorman, 64, has transformed Morgan Stanley through a series of major deals into a wealth management powerhouse that aims to manage $10 trillion in assets.The company has deliberately prepared executives over a decade to take over, which gives them an advantage over any external candidates, Gorman said last month.Pick, 54, heads Morgan Stanley's institutional securities group, overseeing areas including investment banking, equities and fixed income. He formerly led sales and trading.Saperstein, 56, is in charge of the wealth management unit that has bolstered Morgan Stanley's profits in recent years. He previously worked at Merrill Lynch and McKinsey.Simkowitz, 58, jointly leads corporate strategy alongside his role running investment management.""I know how hard it is to do these jobs and how much complexity there is,"" Gorman said at the conference. ""You've got to have a lot of resilience - I think physical resilience, mental resilience - and I think you've got to be prepared to make the call"" on major decisions.Wall Street succession plans have come into focus in recent months as the tenures of financial crisis-era leaders stretch on. Peter Orszag, a banker and former White House official, will take over as Lazard's CEO in October from his predecessor Kenneth Jacobs, who held the role for 14 years.By contrast, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said last month he has no plans to leave after 17 years atop the largest U.S. lender. Brian Moynihan, who was named Bank of America CEO in January 2010 at the same time as Gorman, signaled in 2021 he would drive the firm through a second decade.The appointment of Gorman's successor will be watched closely, both for its significance at the firm, and more broadly in an industry that faces a weaker economic outlook, rising geopolitical tensions and sweeping technological change.""I feel great about handing over - 14 years is a long time to do anything,"" Gorman said at the conference.(Reporting by Lananh Nguyen; Editing by Paritosh Bansal, Megan Davies and Jamie Freed)]"

It is seeking to put in place a new set of higher capital requirements, known as Basel 3, that will force some to hold greater buffers against losses.These tougher rules were already in the works before the collapse of several regional US banks in the spring. In the wake of those troubles, regulators made it clear that they wanted to make sure their new approach applied to institutions similar in size to First Republic or a Silicon Valley Bank. Both had more than $200 billion in assets at the time of their failures.Powell said last week he does not expect smaller community banks to be subject to the higher capital requirements, which are expected to be proposed sometime this summer. Institutions with at least $100 billion in assets may have to comply.Powell was asked repeatedly by Republicans on Capitol Hill last week about the risks of imposing higher capital requirements and how much capital is too much capital. The Fed chair acknowledged that higher requirements trade-off balancing a more stable banking system against the potential for less lending.Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing before Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee at Dirksen Senate Office Building on June 22, 2023 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) (Alex Wong via Getty Images)“Much will depend on getting the specifics right, and we should bear in mind that there are always trade-offs in any financial regulation,” Powell said Thursday. “In addition, the US has benefited from its rich, multi-tiered banking ecosystem, and that diversity should be preserved.”Powell said the banking system is much stronger as a result of the capital requirements and safeguards built around the largest banks since the financial crisis in 2008.Story continues“The events of the past couple of months would have been much more difficult to manage had the largest banks been undercapitalized or illiquid,” he said.Powell’s observations come after the Fed released the results of its annual stress tests on Wednesday. These showed that all 23 US banks required to undergo the test could continue lending to households and businesses during a hypothetical severe recession. They had capital levels equivalent to more than 10% in aggregate, well above the 4.5% buffer the central bank requires.“The bank runs and failures in 2023, however, were painful reminders that we cannot predict all of the stresses that will inevitably come with time and chance,” Powell said Thursday. “We therefore must not grow complacent about the financial system’s resilience.”]"

(NYSE: FE), has begun a significant project to help prevent or minimize service disruptions in downtown Johnstown, Cambria County, by reinforcing its underground electrical network. The work involves replacing key sections of one of the four primary underground cables that delivers electricity to about 900 downtown customer locations, including the Cambria County War Memorial, Conemaugh Medical Center, city and county offices and senior living high-rises.Penelec Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)The work also includes installing new underground transformers and protective devices designed to rapidly detect and isolate damage when problems occur and reroute electricity to nearby cables to prevent or shorten the duration of power interruptions.""We are focused on critical work to improve the downtown network, which includes proactively replacing nearly two miles of primary cable that supplies electricity to the city center,"" said Scott Wyman, president of FirstEnergy's Pennsylvania operations. ""Last summer, we replaced an underground power line after it was damaged by an equipment-related fire, and the work underway allows us to build off that enhancement in a more positive and planned way.""Among the improvements slated in 2023 is the replacement of other key network components integral to providing reliable electric service to downtown customers. In recent weeks, crews began excavating near Sargent's Stadium at the Point to install underground ductwork that will enclose three side-by-side power lines comprising a main downtown electrical circuit that runs beneath Broad, Johns, Locust, Walnut, Main, Market and several other streets. This work will help make the power line more durable against elements like dirt, rocks, lightning and water and other external factors like accidental dig-ins.Story continuesThe excavation work was completed before the Thunder in the Valley motorcycle rally in late June. The new cable should be in place and energized later this fall. Crews also recently replaced a new transformer and protective device and are on track to replace another six pieces of key equipment – two transformers, three protective devices and a switch – this summer and fall. The equipment is housed in underground concrete vaults throughout the city and motorists may encounter flaggers closing off portions of roadways as work occurs.Replacement of the electrical circuit falls under Penelec's Long Term Infrastructure Improvement Plan (LTIIP II), a $200 million initiative to accelerate capital investments to the company's electric distribution system over five years and help ensure continued electric service reliability for customers. Replacement of the transformers, protective devices and switch is not considered LTIIP work.Penelec serves approximately 585,000 customers within 17,600 square miles of northern and central Pennsylvania. Follow Penelec on Twitter @Penelec and on Facebook at   www.facebook.com/PenelecElectric.FirstEnergy is dedicated to integrity, safety, reliability and operational excellence. Its 10 electric distribution companies form one of the nation's largest investor-owned electric systems, serving customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, West Virginia, Maryland and New York.

And CRM’s new commitment to profits, coupled with its growth outlook, has Salesforce stock trading at some extremely attractive valuation levels.Salesforce’s expansive portfolio of subscription software offerings are also more essential than ever before across every aspect of the economy.Price, Technical Levels &amp; Valuation Salesforce shares have soared nearly 60% YTD to outshine Amazon, Apple, and many other big tech stocks. Even after its impressive ride, CRM currently trades 10% below its average Zacks price target and roughly 32% under its 2021 peaks.CRM has underperformed the wider Zacks Tech Sector over the last five years, up 55% vs. 85%, as Wall Street appeared to grow frustrated with its commitment to growth over the bottom line—but that is changing (as we will get to).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSalesforce has soared 450% in the last 10 years to blow away the Zacks Tech sector’s 260%, with it also up roughly 1,140% in the last 15 years to triple the tech sector and roughly match Microsoft MSFT. One of the nearby charts also showcases CRM’s massive run since its 2004 IPO year.Salesforce has pulled back from the 52-week highs it hit at the end of May. The small drop pushed it below oversold RSI territory and right to neutral levels. Plus, CRM stock recently found support at its 50-day moving average, while trading far above its 200-day. Technical-focused traders might also be glad to know that Salesforce is once again above both its 200-week and 50-week moving averages.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe downturn coupled with its improved earnings outlook has Salesforce trading at 35.7X forward 12-month earnings. This marks a massive discount to its own five-year highs of 206X and 70% value compared to its five-year median.Story continuesCRM’s PEG ratio, which factors in its growth outlook, currently comes in at its lowest levels since the financial crisis at 1.9. Salesforce’s PEG ratio also marks a discount to Zacks Tech sector and solid value vs. Microsoft’s 2.7, Apple’s 2.3, and its Computer-Software industry’s 2.6.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Business and Its Profitability PivotSalesforce is one of the pioneers of modern business software and the wider customer relationship management and software-as-a-service industries. CRM’s current offerings support sales, marketing, commerce, customer and client engagement, analytics, app development, and beyond, servicing a wide spectrum of the economy.Salesforce, like nearly every tech company, is pushing forward into the booming world of artificial intelligence. The company is currently working to infuse “trusted, secure generative AI across our entire product portfolio. Salesforce's generative AI ecosystem wields Einstein GPT, Slack GPT, and Tableau GPT, delivering trusted power across our product portfolio.”Salesforce made a few large acquisitions over the last several years to expand its reach. These efforts include its $28 billion deal to buy Slack in the summer of 2021 to help CRM compete against Microsoft and others in the evolving work communication space. The deal came roughly two years after Salesforce paid $15 billion for data analytics platform Tableau.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThese recent deals could mark the last in a long time for Salesforce as it focuses on the bottom line following a successful activist investor push. CEO Marc Benioff said on its Q4 FY23 (2022) earnings call on March 1 that the goal “is to make Salesforce the largest and most profitable software company in the world.”Salesforce’s transformation plan includes short-term and long-term restructuring. Salesforce also said earlier this year that it disbanded its M&amp;A committee. Salesforce is focused on a transformational FY24 that includes a beefed-up share repurchase plan from $10 billion to $20 billion.Growth and Outlook Salesforce posted between roughly 25% to 35% sales growth for 10 straight years through its fiscal 2022. CRM then grew its revenue by 18% in fiscal 2023 (last year). Zacks estimates call for Salesforce’s revenue to climb by roughly 11% in both FY24 and FY25 to see it hit $38.47 billion. These are the kinds of stable low double-digit sales growth figures  (mostly organic) that Wall Street will love as long as it is accompanied by solid bottom line expansion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSalesforce’s adjusted earnings are projected to soar by 42% this year to hit $7.44 per share and then climb by about 21% next year to $8.99 a share. These growth projections follow 10% adjusted earnings growth last year. Plus, Salesforce has beaten our quarterly EPS estimates for five years running.Bottom LineSalesforce’s subscription software offerings aren’t going out of style in our digital-driven world. The tech giant’s new-found focus on margins and profitability should also start to attract long-term investors to again, as will its AI efforts. Salesforce’s upbeat earnings outlook helps it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) as we close out June and look ahead to the potentially bullish second half. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Even better if you can buy them when they have improving earnings estimates and high Zacks Ranks, as this further improves the near-term odds of the stock trading higher.By scanning the Zacks Rank, I have identified three top-ranked stocks with exactly these characteristics. Copart CPRT, Akami Technologies AKAM, and Salesforce CRM all have numerous bullish catalysts acting in their favor.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCopartCopart is a global online vehicle auction and remarketing platform founded in 1982. It facilitates the buying and selling of vehicles through its digital marketplace, serving individuals, dealerships, and insurance companies. With operations at over 200 locations in 11 countries, Copart has more than 250,000 vehicles available online every day.The company focuses on advanced technologies and data analytics to enhance the auction experience. Copart's efficient processes and extensive network have established its position as a leading player in the automotive industry with an estimated 40% market share in the auction market.CPRT stock has been an exceptional performer over the last 10 years compounding at an annual rate of 27.4% and returning 1,026% over that time. Also, over that period annual sales have steadily increased from $1.1 billion to $3.7 billion, and EPS have grown from $0.39 to $2.41 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCopart enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Analysts have unanimously upgraded earnings expectations across timeframes, with current quarter earnings estimates revised 3.5% higher and FY23 earnings estimates revised nearly 4% higher. Additionally, current quarter earnings are projected to grow 5.3% YoY and FY23 earnings are expected to climb 9% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesCPRT is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple 36.7x, which is above the industry average of 32.7x and above its five-year median of 32x. However, as the leading auction platform in the industry, it is understandable that Copart earns a premium valuation.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAkami Technologies Akamai Technologies is a global content delivery network (CDN) and cloud services provider founded in 1998. The company offers solutions to accelerate and secure the delivery of online content, applications, and media. With a robust network infrastructure and advanced CDN technology, Akamai serves clients across various industries, optimizing website performance and providing cloud security against cybersecurity threats. Akamai remains a leading player in the digital content space, continuously adapting to meet evolving industry demands.AKAM has experienced strong upgrades in its earnings estimates, demonstrated by its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 5.2% and are projected to grow 4.5% YoY. FY23 earnings have increased by 5.5% over the last two months and are forecast to climb 7.5% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAkami Technologies is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 19.8x, which is below the industry average of 23.9x, and below its 10-year median of 26.3x. With a valuation below its historic average and continued earnings growth, AKAM looks quite appealing.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSalesforceSalesforce is a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform that offers a suite of tools and services to manage sales, marketing, customer service, and analytics. Founded in 1999, Salesforce has become a global leader in CRM solutions, providing businesses with a centralized hub for storing and managing customer data.The platform offers customization options and integrations to meet specific business needs. With its user-friendly interface and scalability, Salesforce enables organizations to strengthen customer relationships and drive growth through efficient CRM management.After a major restructuring earlier this year which involved laying off some 12,000 employees to increase profits, CRM has been one of the leading stocks in the market. The stock is up an impressive 59% YTD.Momentum seems to have taken ahold of Salesforce stock as the chart looks like it is ready for its next leg higher. The technical pattern below indicates that if CRM can clear the $214 level, it may very well initiate another bull run to new YTD highs. But, if the stock can’t hold above the $205 level, the pattern is invalid, and investors can wait for another trade setup.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewFurther improving the odds that CRM rallies again are its upward trending earnings revisions. Salesforce currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 12.4% and are expected to climb a whopping 60% YoY. FY23 earnings estimates have been upgraded by 4.6% and are projected to increase 42% YoY.Sales for the software giant are expected to grow ~10% YoY across timeframes, so clearly the restructuring has been successful in boosting the bottom line.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSalesforce has managed to engineer something rather unique. Despite considerable stock appreciation over the last year, its earnings multiple has more than halved thanks to the massive increase in profits. CRM is trading at a one-year forward multiple of 39.7x, which is above the industry average of 33.5x, and below its five-year median of 122x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineInvestors using Zacks proprietary research don’t need to look far to find high quality investment ideas. While timing the market is an incredibly difficult activity, investors’ odds of success can be greatly increased by trading only stocks on the Zacks Rank #1 list, which regularly outperform the market.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company’s consistent measures to reward its shareholders through dividends hold promise.Let’s delve deeper to unearth the factors that make this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company a solid investment option now.Record Booking Levels: Record booking levels due to strong MRO and aftermarket activity are driving Flowserve’s growth. The strength in MRO and aftermarket activity can be attributed to growth in Flow Control Division and seals businesses. First-quarter 2023 bookings of $1.06 billion marked the company’s fifth consecutive quarter of above $1 billion bookings.The company’s Diversify, Decarbonize and Digitize strategy also supports FLS’ strong booking levels. Solid booking levels highlight the strength across the company’s end-markets. Flowserve expects the uptrend in bookings to continue throughout 2023. It also expects strong orders to drive growth in 2023.Strong booking levels have encouraged Flowserve to raise its 2023 guidance. The company expects revenues to increase 10-12% year over year in 2023, compared with 9-11% rise anticipated earlier. Adjusted earnings are estimated to be $1.65-$1.85 per share compared with $1.50-$1.75 anticipated earlier.Expansion Initiatives: Flowserve believes in acquiring businesses/assets to expand its product offerings. In February 2023, the company inked a deal to acquire Velan Inc. in an all-cash transaction valued at approximately $245 million. The buyout will strengthen Flowserve’s valves portfolio and build upon its existing assets through the addition of Velan’s premier brands, strong heritage and technical expertise in diverse end markets.The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the third quarter of 2023. Velan will become part of Flowserve’s Flow Control Division segment. FLS expects to achieve annualized cost synergies of at least $20 million from the acquisition by the end of the first year. The transaction is expected to be accretive to Flowserve’s adjusted earnings in the first year.Rewards to Shareholders: Flowserve is committed to rewarding its shareholders handsomely. In 2022, the company paid out dividends worth $104.5 million to its shareholders. In the first quarter of 2023, FLS paid dividends of $26.2 million.Northward Estimate Revision: The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Flowserve’s 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 7.7% in the past 60 days.Price Performance: Primarily due to strong booking levels, shares of Flowserve have gained 19% in the past months, outperforming the industry’s 11% increase.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOther Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks within the broader Industrial Products sector are as follows:Ingersoll Rand IR presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.

At the same time, while home shoppers had more homes to choose from this month, improvement stalled as the active inventory growth rate slowed for the fourth month in a row (+7.1%) and came in well below May's +21.5% rate.""While home asking prices grew seasonally, price gains have been weakening since last summer as rising mortgage rates have added to ongoing affordability challenges and further cooled buyer demand, so the first year-over-year decline in median list prices this month wasn't unexpected. While this could feel like a welcome relief for buyers, our revised 2023 outlook expects only a modest drop in home prices of 0.6% for the year. This may not be enough to noticeably bring down costs until the end of the year as inflation and rates start to fall too,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""Fewer potential sellers opting to list their home because of the mortgage rate lock-in effect continues to be a drag on the market. Fortunately, for those willing to make a move, falling prices won't erase the substantial price gains seen the past few years, and most will likely have enough equity to come out ahead.""What it means for homebuyers, sellers, and the housing marketAffordability has evolved into an increasingly important factor in home purchase decisions, and a drop in home listing prices creates potential opportunities for buyers, especially with some creativity.""If buyers see homes sitting on the market for a while that haven't received many good offers, there may be some opportunities for further negotiations. It never hurts to ask a seller if they would be willing to reduce their price a little, contribute to closing costs, or even buy down their mortgage rate,"" said Realtor.com® Executive News Editor Clare Trapasso. ""While this likely won't work for the well-located, move-in ready homes oozing curb appeal, buyers may want to take another look at homes that may need a little work. Sometimes a coat of paint and minor work can make a big difference.""Story continuesJune 2023 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over June 2022Change over June 2019Median listing price-0.9% (to $445,000)+39.1 %Active listings+7.1 %-49.7 %New listings-25.7 %-28.8 %Median days on market+13 days (to 44 days)-10 daysShare of active listings with price reductions+-0.7 percentage points (to 14.1%)-2.9 percentage pointsHome asking prices see first annual decline as high borrowing costs create barriersRecent near-record high mortgage rates and still-high listing prices continue to create affordability challenges for homebuyers, which is putting downward pressure on home list prices, which slipped annually in June for the first time since 2017. Despite high borrowing costs and a low inventory of homes to choose from in the market, homebuying sentiment continues to improve in recent months, and a new survey from Realtor.com® and Censuswide found that the vast majority of respondents, nearly 9 in 10 of those shopping, still hope to make a home purchase happen this year.In June, the U.S. median list price grew to $445,000, up from $441,000 in May but down slightly (-0.9%) from June 2022's record high of $449,000.Northeastern metros had the highest growth rate in active listing prices, with an average increase of 11.7% over the past year. Prices in Cincinnati, Ohio (+20.0%), Rochester, N.Y. (+19.6%), and Los Angeles (+17.7%) saw the biggest increases among large metros. However, in each of these metros the mix of inventory changed and larger, more expensive homes were listed for sale in June compared to the previous year.Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, 15 out of the largest 50 markets saw their median list price decline. The greatest price declines were seen in Texas metros: Austin (-6.8% year over year), Houston (-5.1%), and Raleigh, N.C. (-4.2%).Nationally, the share of homes with price reductions was mostly flat in June, decreasing slightly from 14.7% last June to 14.1% this year.Among the largest metros, the largest increases in the percentage of homes with price reductions compared to last year were in San Antonio, Texas (+8.3 percentage points), Memphis, Tenn. (+6.3 pp) and Jacksonville, Fla. (+4.7 pp).Buyers short on options as active inventory declines in many areasThere continues to be an ongoing lack of homes for sale as potential sellers with near-record equity take a wait-and-see approach and buyers compete over the remaining available homes for sale. In June, the growth in the number of active homes for sale slowed for the fourth month in a row, and growth stalled completely in the final week of June, with the number of active homes for sale slipping below (-0.3%) year ago levels for the first time in a year (59 weeks). New listings to the market have been scarce this year too – the pace of new listings year-to-date is even lower (-16.4%) than in the first half of 2020, when the real estate market was still contending with pandemic-era closures, restrictions, and uncertainties – highlighting just how short on options buyers are in today's market.Nationally, active inventory grew 7.1% year over year in June, but slowed for the fourth month in a row, registering less than half of May's 21.5% rate. On average, active inventory in June was 50.6% below pre-pandemic 2017–2019 levels.Both pending listings (-16.7%), or homes under contract, and newly listed homes (-25.7%) declined year over year. The number of homes newly-listed for sale declined at a faster rate in June than May's 22.7% decrease.Among the 50 largest metros, inventory growth is being driven almost exclusively by the South, which saw the most growth (+24.1%) in homes for sale compared to last June, led by San Antonio (+65.7%), Nashville, Tenn. (63.3%) and New Orleans (60.0%). All other regions saw declining annual growth in active inventory in June.Active inventory decreased in 28 out of 50 of the largest metros compared to last year. Western markets reported the largest yearly declines, with the top three in California metros: San Jose, (-44.1%), San Diego (-35.9%), and Sacramento (-33.4%).In June, none of the 50 largest metro areas saw new listings increase over last year.Homes continue to linger longer on the market, giving buyers more time to searchDespite a significant slowing from the frenzied pace of the past couple years, in most areas of the country, the housing market continues to move quicker than it did in the pre-pandemic era, with homes today selling more than a week faster on average than in pre-pandemic June 2017-2019.The typical home spent 43 days on market in June, 14 days longer than this time last year, but 10 fewer days than they typically did in the average June 2017–2019.Across the 50 largest U.S. metros, in June the typical home spent 44 days on the market, 13 days more than the previous June. This trend was seen across all regions, with larger metros in the South seeing the greatest increase (+15 days), followed by the West (+9 days), Northeast (+7 days) and Midwest (+6 days). Homes in Western metros were also spending one more day on the market than pre-pandemic times, but in all other regions homes were still selling more quickly.All of the 50 largest metros saw an increase in time on market compared to the previous year.

Motorola Solutions (NYSE: MSI) today released the findings of its 2023 Natural Disaster and Severe Weather Preparedness Survey, which captured sentiments from 1,000 United States residents in May. The results uncovered growing concern from the public about severe weather and their levels of preparedness, as well as insights that uncover opportunities for greater collaboration between emergency managers and community members when it comes to proactive planning and critical communications.""Severe weather events are occurring year round and challenging residents, as well as seasoned emergency managers in both the public and private sectors,"" said Todd Piett, vice president of Rave Mobile Safety at Motorola Solutions. ""Our hope is that this new independent research sheds light on the public’s growing concerns and shifting preferences as weather disasters become more severe. These insights can help shape safety steps, considerations and protocols for all stakeholders involved.""Key findings from the report include:Natural disasters affect residents’ everyday lives - Severe weather and natural disasters create significant, negative impacts on respondents’ lives: 66% of the public report that they have missed work, and 40% say that they have been unable to get necessities (food, water, gas, etc.).The public’s level of concern outweighs its preparedness - While 86% of respondents are at least somewhat concerned about the intensity and frequency of natural disasters increasing in the coming years, only 36% of those surveyed feel very or extremely prepared to face major weather events.The public has faith in first responders - An overwhelming majority (93%) of respondents say emergency responders are somewhat prepared, prepared or extremely prepared to help them/their communities in the event of a natural disaster. The same number of respondents indicate that they are confident that their public safety and emergency management agencies are equipped to handle severe weather emergencies.Story continuesThe public prefers to receive severe weather alerts directly from the authorities it trusts - When asked which communication method would be their preferred source of truth during natural disasters, respondents said they would have the greatest confidence in SMS/text messages (34%) or mobile safety app alerts (32%) from local and/or state officials.Everyone plays a role in safety - Community members are taking proactive steps to prepare for weather events, including assembling safety kits (67%), signing up for emergency notifications from their local government and/or public safety department (57%) and creating an evacuation or family preparedness plan (47%). Another positive trend to note is that more residents are sharing information about themselves or their loved ones with public safety agencies and/or 9-1-1 via an online safety profile or access/functional needs registry (35%, up from 18% in 2022).Motorola Solutions offers a myriad of public safety technologies to help during natural disasters, including mission-critical radio infrastructure and devices, command center technologies that mobilize the flow of intelligence across public safety agencies as well as multimodal emergency communication capabilities (mass notification, email, phone, signage, texts), mobile safety apps and 9-1-1 safety profiles.To view the full findings of the survey, download the 2023 Natural Disaster and Severe Weather Preparedness Survey here.MethodologyThe independent ​​market ​​research firm Researchscape conducted this survey.

Other tools developed by OpenAI can be used to create digital artworks. The AI tools have surged in popularity as a way to automate tasks.The legal claims accuse OpenAI of hoovering up personal and copyrighted information by indiscriminately scraping the web, including names, contact details, emails, payment data and social media profiles without consent.The accusers claim OpenAI used this information to train its AI chatbot. They also allege the company allowed children to access its service and collected their information in violation of US law by failing to offer proper parental consent tools.The class action claim has demanded $3bn from the tech companies, based on the hundreds of dollars in personal information allegedly stolen from people across the US.The legal action adds the companies showed a “disregard for the potentially catastrophic risk to humanity” when developing their tools, which some experts contend could pose an existential risk to mankind.Sam Altman, chief executive of OpenAI, has called for regulation of AI products. The ChatGPT creator has received billions of dollars in investment from tech giant Microsoft.The case is ongoing. OpenAI has been contacted.

The deal had been announced in January 2022 and the FTC sued to stop it in December last year.Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley in San Francisco pressed FTC lawyers on where their economist got the data to show the deal would harm consumers.The FTC has said that if Microsoft bought Activision, Microsoft would have the incentive and the ability to harm competition in markets related to consoles, subscription game services and cloud gaming.""The harm here is we think is substantial in locking up Activision content,"" said FTC lawyer James Weingarten.After an extended back and forth over how the FTC came to its conclusions, Corley said: ""All this is for a shooter video game.""Microsoft's Beth Wilkinson, who argued that ""Call of Duty"" was not essential to any gaming platform, said the deal would mean the game would be licensed broadly.""More consumers are going to get the game. And that's good for gamers, but it's also good for Microsoft,"" she said.To address the FTC concerns, Microsoft has agreed to license ""Call of Duty"" to rivals.Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella sought to allay antitrust concerns on Wednesday by saying the company would have no incentive to shut out Sony's PlayStation in order to sell more Microsoft Xbox consoles.Story continues""It makes no economic sense and no strategic sense,"" Nadella said.Corley has been asked to pause the deal so the agency's in-house judge can rule. In the past, the side that lost in federal court often conceded and the in-house process was scrapped.The FTC, which enforces antitrust law, has taken a harder line on mergers during the Biden administration to protect consumers from being disadvantaged by powerful corporations.Microsoft's bid to acquire the ""Call of Duty"" videogame maker also faces opposition from British competition authorities.Canada is still monitoring the planned transaction.(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Lincoln Feast)]"

But don’t worry, we all make these mistakes at one time or another. But the key is to develop better habits so you don’t keep repeating them.First Mistake: Not StartingBelieve it or not, one of the biggest mistakes many people make is to never to start investing. Procrastination takes over and you never open up that IRA or trading account.Another mistake, which piggybacks on never starting, is starting to invest at an older age. Among the biggest regrets of older investors was not starting earlier. Just start.Second Mistake: Jumping on the Latest TrendsDid you buy Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF in 2020 because it was up over 100% that year? If so, you were jumping into the latest trend. Many times, following the hottest stocks, or trends, can end badly as many investors tend to get into a trend late in its cycle.Currently, AI is the latest trend. At summer barbecues, investors are asking Tracey about stocks like C3.ai and NVIDIA.1.      C3.ai, Inc. AIStory continuesC3.ai has the best ticker, right now, on Wall Street in AI. Shares of C3.ai are up 195% year-to-date as money pours in the AI industry.C3.ai has no P/E because the company is expected to have negative earnings in 2024 or a loss of $0.28. It’s price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, however, is 14, which is high.Is C3.ai simply too hot to handle?2.      NVIDIA Corp. NVDANVIDIA has been the darling of Wall Street in 2023 thanks to its AI business, but how many retail investors have ever heard of them? At barbecues, investors aren’t mentioning NVIDIA to Tracey.NVIDIA shares are up 182% year-to-date nevertheless. It’s definitely one of the hot stocks in 2023 as professional investors pile in.NVIDIA trades with a forward P/E of 53 and a P/S ratio of 40. NVIDIA is not cheap, but earnings are soaring.Is NVIDIA also too hot to handle?Mistake Three: Not Doing Your Own ResearchAt a summer barbecue, Tracey was asked about T-Mobile and Visa because a Chicago billionaire owned T-Mobile (allegedly) and Warren Buffett owned Visa (Berkshire bought it in 2011).Other than billionaires buying the stocks, these investors didn’t know anything else about these companies.A big mistake is not doing your own research. Stock investors are owners of their companies. Shouldn’t you know what a company makes or does before you become an owner?3.      T-Mobile TMUST-Mobile performed well during the pandemic, with the shares up 127% over the last 5 years compared to the S&amp;P 500 up 59% during that same time. This year, however, shares are down 2.9%.T-Mobile has a forward P/E of 19.3 but a PEG ratio of just 0.6. Earnings are expected to jump 239% this year to $6.99 from $2.06.However, if you’re looking for income, T-Mobile doesn’t pay a dividend.Should T-Mobile be on your short list?4.      Visa Inc. VVisa has been a phenomenal stock since its 2008 IPO. Shares are up 770% during that period versus just 100% for the S&amp;P 500.Visa got expensive during the pandemic on a P/E basis but shares cooled off in the last 2 years. They’re down 4% during that period while earnings continue to rise. Earnings are expected to be up 14.5% in fiscal 2023 and 12.8% in fiscal 2024.Visa now has a forward P/E of 26.3. It’s a Zacks Rank #3 (Buy).Should Visa be back on your short list?Update on Walgreens Boots Alliance: A Value Trap?Tracey recently did a podcast on the dividend aristocrats which included Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA. Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance were near 5-year lows ahead of its earnings report. And then it reported earnings. It cut guidance and announced it was cutting 150 stores in the United States.Shares of Walgreens Boots Alliance fell to new 5-year lows and are at 2012 levels. It continues to pay its dividend, however, currently yielding 6.1%.Another mistake investors make is only buying a stock for its dividend. High dividends, outside of REITs and commodity stocks, can be a warning sign of a value trap.Is Walgreens Boots Alliance a value trap?What Else Do You Need to Know About Investing Mistakes?Listen to this week’s podcast to find out.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

But don’t worry, we all make these mistakes at one time or another. But the key is to develop better habits so you don’t keep repeating them.First Mistake: Not StartingBelieve it or not, one of the biggest mistakes many people make is to never to start investing. Procrastination takes over and you never open up that IRA or trading account.Another mistake, which piggybacks on never starting, is starting to invest at an older age. Among the biggest regrets of older investors was not starting earlier. Just start.Second Mistake: Jumping on the Latest TrendsDid you buy Cathie Wood’s Ark Innovation ETF in 2020 because it was up over 100% that year? If so, you were jumping into the latest trend. Many times, following the hottest stocks, or trends, can end badly as many investors tend to get into a trend late in its cycle.Currently, AI is the latest trend. At summer barbecues, investors are asking Tracey about stocks like C3.ai and NVIDIA.1.      C3.ai, Inc. (AI)C3.ai has the best ticker, right now, on Wall Street in AI. Shares of C3.ai are up 195% year-to-date as money pours in the AI industry.C3.ai has no P/E because the company is expected to have negative earnings in 2024 or a loss of $0.28. It’s price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, however, is 14, which is high.Is C3.ai simply too hot to handle?2.      NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA)NVIDIA has been the darling of Wall Street in 2023 thanks to its AI business, but how many retail investors have ever heard of them?

It may not have been easy to hold on to PH for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Parker-Hannifin's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Parker-Hannifin's main business drivers.Parker-Hannifin Corporation is a global diversified manufacturer of motion &amp; control technologies and systems. The company provides precision engineered solutions for a wide variety of mobile, industrial and aerospace markets.Diversified Industrial Segment (73.4% of third-quarter fiscal 2023 sales): This segment is engaged in the production of a wide range of motion-control and fluid systems &amp; components. The products offered by this segment are used in transportation, mobile construction, refrigeration and air conditioning, agriculture and other markets.The segment sells its products through two main channels, namely, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and extensive distribution network to smaller OEMs and the aftermarket.Products offered include sealing devices (dynamic and static); filters, systems and instruments to monitor and remove contaminants from fuel, air, oil, water and other liquids and gases; fluid connectors that control, transmit and contain fluid; hydraulic components and systems for builders and users of industrial and mobile machinery and equipment; and high-quality flow control solutions.Aerospace Systems (23.6%): This segment supervises the designing and manufacturing of products and also provides aftermarket support for a broad range of aerospace products including commercial, business jet, military and general aviation aircraft and missile.Products offered include control actuation systems &amp; components, fluid metering, delivery &amp; atomization devices, fuel systems &amp; components, pneumatic control components, hydraulic systems &amp; components and lubrication components among others.The segment's products and services are offered to OEM and maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) customers throughout the world. Notably, the products are marketed by field sales employees and are sold to manufacturers as well as end customers.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Parker-Hannifin ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $3,945.11, or a 294.51% gain, as of June 28, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.The S&amp;P 500 rose 171.41% and the price of gold increased 49.18% over the same time frame in comparison.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for PH.Parker-Hannifin is poised for growth on the back of synergies from the Meggitt buyout (September 2022) and benefits from the Win strategy. The Meggitt buyout has bolstered the company’s Aerospace Systems unit (revenues jumped 88.9% year over year in the fiscal third quarter). Benefits from the Win strategy are driving the company’s margins. The company’s measures to add shareholder value hold promise. In April, the company hiked its dividend by 11%. Backed by these tailwinds, shares of Parker-Hannifin have outperformed its industry in the year-to-date period. However, escalating cost of sales (up 20.5% year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2023) poses a threat to the company’s bottom line. Foreign currency headwinds are weighing on its top line. Weak liquidity position is an added concern for Parker-Hannifin.Shares have gained 15.12% over the past four weeks and there have been 9 higher earnings estimate revisions for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.04% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow lost 0.22%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 2.93%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the agribusiness giant had gained 3.44% over the past month. This has outpaced the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 2.18% and lagged the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.22% in that time.Archer Daniels Midland will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. In that report, analysts expect Archer Daniels Midland to post earnings of $1.55 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 27.91%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $24.99 billion, down 8.41% from the year-ago period.ADM's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $6.80 per share and revenue of $97.79 billion.

83,32d81855-96e1-3d2a-b1f5-672cf1ebfc96,ADM,2023-06-29,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Archer Daniels Midland Company (ADM) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-archer-daniels-130011266.html,1687957211,STORY,['ADM'],"[Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this agribusiness giant have returned +3.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Agriculture - Operations industry, which ADM falls in, has gained 2.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, ADM is expected to post earnings of $1.55 per share, indicating a change of -27.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.9% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.80 points to a change of -13.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.6%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.12 indicates a change of -10% from what ADM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, ADM is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of ADM, the consensus sales estimate of $24.99 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -8.4%. The $97.79 billion and $97.37 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -4% and -0.4%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryADM reported revenues of $24.07 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +1.8%. EPS of $2.09 for the same period compares with $1.90 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $23.48 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.52%. The EPS surprise was +22.22%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.ADM is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about ADM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Monster Beverage:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.22 = US$1.7b ÷ (US$8.8b - US$1.2b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Monster Beverage has an ROCE of 22%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 15% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Monster Beverage roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Monster Beverage compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Monster Beverage here  for free.So How Is Monster Beverage's ROCE Trending?In terms of Monster Beverage's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 29% where it was five years ago. Although, given both revenue and the amount of assets employed in the business have increased, it could suggest the company is investing in growth, and the extra capital has led to a short-term reduction in ROCE. If these investments prove successful, this can bode very well for long term stock performance.Story continuesThe Bottom LineEven though returns on capital have fallen in the short term, we find it promising that revenue and capital employed have both increased for Monster Beverage. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 98% to shareholders over the last five years. So while the underlying trends could already be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Monster Beverage, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

85,80bc4da7-d0ee-3ef0-ade9-8faea6173212,MNST,2023-06-29,15 Hardest Sports in the World Ranked,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-hardest-sports-world-ranked-200548528.html,1687982682,STORY,"['DIS', 'WWE', 'MNST', 'V']","[In this article, we are going to discuss the 15 hardest sports in the world ranked. You can skip our detailed analysis of the history of sports, the world’s #1 sport, the hardest sport in Asia, sports sponsorships and endorsements, disruptions and innovations in the sports market, the future of ESPN and the future outlook of sports streaming, and go directly to 5 Hardest Sports in the World Ranked. While the majority of sports played today have been created/developed in the 19th and 20th centuries, our ancestors started competing against each other in primitive sports as a means of pastime and entertainment in ancient times. In the beginning, sports often involved training for war or training as a hunter, which explains why so many early games involved the throwing of spears, stakes, and rocks, and sparring one-on-one with opponents. As time went on, sporting competitions became more organized and the best example of this revolution in organized sports occurred in ancient Greece, where the first Olympic games took place in 760 BC. Though sports are an excellent source of entertainment for their viewers worldwide, many of them are a dangerous affair for the athletes involved. For this reason, we have compiled a List of the Hardest Sports in the World. World’s No. 1 Sport:Soccer is the No. 1 sport in the world, in terms of popularity, with around 3.5 billion fans worldwide and players in almost every country of the world. The Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) is currently made up of 205 member associations, with over 300,000 clubs and 240 million registered players. FIFA functions as a non-profit organization and most of its revenue is derived from TV broadcasting rights, advertisements for the World Cup, and the sale of licensing rights. FIFA reported a revenue of $7.568 billion for the 2019-22 period, representing a cycle-on-cycle increase of 18%, compared to $6.421 billion for the 2015-18 period. An estimated 1.5 billion people around the world watched the pulsating Final between Argentina and France, while another 88,966 spectators were packed inside the Lusail Stadium. Story continuesSoccer is also one of the toughest sports in the world, hence it is included in our ranking of hardest sports in the world. Another sport becoming increasingly popular in the U.S. is pickleball. If you wish to read more about it, please refer to our article Top 15 Pickleball Companies and Brands. Hardest Sport in Asia:If you are from outside of Southeast Asia, you are probably not familiar with the sport called ‘Sepak Takraw’, a sport that is a combination of volleyball, badminton and soccer. Astonishingly visceral and explosive, sepak takraw or kick volleyball, ranks among the toughest sports in the world demanding lightning reflexes, precise control and fearless, gravity-defying leaps. Since the sport is not an Olympic event, it finds its biggest stage at the Asian Games, where Thailand has been the dominant country by a margin. Sports Sponsorships and Endorsements:Sports have become a gigantic industry generating hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue every year, and a large part of this revenue is contributed by sponsorship deals and endorsements. While companies generally sponsor entire teams and events, they can also pay individual athletes to advocate for their brands. A big example of this is the symbiotic partnership between NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and the basketball legend Michael Jordan. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) welcomed the legendary Chicago Bulls shooting guard into the family back in 1984, with an upfront commitment of $250,000 and Jordan’s very own signature shoe line. During the 2022 financial year, the Air Jordan brand by NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) generated a revenue of $5.1 billion, with Jordan himself reportedly pocketing around 5%, or around $256.1 million – that’s double his entire NBA career earnings in just a single year. Michael Jordan has earned an estimated $1.3 billion from his deal with NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and the two partners even signed a lifetime deal back in 2020. The European champion and Premier League golden boot winner, Erling Haaland, also extended his sponsorship deal with NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in March 2023, worth an estimated $24 million. Innovations and Disruptions in the Sports Market:Live sporting events are a special type of content that attracts a lot of viewers and subscribers. Every year, Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX), CBS and NBC – owned by Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), collectively pay the NFL $3 billion for the rights to broadcast the league’s games. In 2021, the NFL signed an 11 year media rights deal, worth an estimated $110 billion, with CBS, Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX), NBC, ESPN, and Amazon.com,Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The deal will commence in 2023.After the deal, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be able to live-stream Thursday Night Football via their Amazon Prime Video app. This adds to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) live portfolio, including Premier League soccer in the U.K. and ATP Tour tennis. The shift to streaming sports via OTT platforms is becoming increasingly apparent, particularly with the recent news of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Major League Soccer (MLS) signing a 10 year global streaming rights deal, worth $2.5 billion. It’s a hybrid model – the coming together of a rights-holder-branded direct-to-consumer (D2C) service. Lionel Messi recently announced that he has found a new home and signed a deal with Inter Miami in the MLS, which has come as a big win for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Having arguably the best player in the game instantly makes the MLS Season Pass subscription, available through Apple TV Plus – the streaming platform of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – much more appealing, especially for the global audience that might otherwise be more interested in European soccer. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) etc. have rewritten the agenda for video on demand entertainment, so it’s natural that live sports fans now also expect the same level of consistency in streaming delivery. D2C platforms have responded to this challenge, and they are gaining traction. The Future of ESPN: ESPN is an American multinational sports media conglomerate owned majorly by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). ESPN’s place in a future streaming-dominated sports world could be as an aggregator, rather than a broadcaster. The network is considering adding links to its website and app that would direct users to live sports streaming broadcasts, including the ones that don’t appear on ESPN. A hub for sports streaming could address consumer frustration of having to figure out where to watch live sports. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) also launched a sports streaming platform ESPN+ in 2018, believing that a shift from ESPN’s traditional cable model to streaming is inevitable for the network. Future Outlook of Sports Streaming:The global sports market grew from $486.61 billion in 2022, to $512.14 billion in 2023, with a CAGR of 5.2%, thus indicating the industry’s massive economic potential.While the big four U.S. professional leagues appear to be more advanced than their European counterparts in exploring the potential of D2C platforms, the next 10 years may tell a different story. According to a report by Ampere Analysis, OTT platforms will spend over $8 billion on sports rights in 2023, to reach 21% of global sports rights investment, up from 13% in 2022. The success and failure of any D2C platform lies in addressing many live streaming issues, including scalability, personalization, latency, picture quality, monetization etc. Until these issues are properly addressed, the current importance of linear media rights revenue in professional sports economics means that we are still away from reaching a point where D2C services are used as the primary distribution platforms by most sports-rights holders. With that said, let's move on to the list of the most demanding sports in the world. 15 Hardest Sports in the World RankedPixabay/Public DomainMethodology: To collect data for this article, we have referred to the following sources: ESPN, SportyTell, Sports Virsa and Bscholar, and looked for rankings of the hardest sports in the world. Then we calculated the weighted average for each sport according to its position in the above-mentioned sources and ranked it accordingly in our list. We assigned the highest weightage (0.4 out of 1) to the ESPN's index's rankings, and a weight of 0.2 each to SportyTell, Sports Visa and Bscholar's indexes. There's variation in weights for sports we found on multiple of these indexes but not all four of them. If you’re a gamer and you’re interested in reading our take on investing in Esports, please read 10 Best Esports Stocks to Buy Now. Here are the toughest sports in the world ranked:15. SwimmingWeighted Average Score: 23.2Swimming may be a pleasant afternoon activity for some people, while others see it as a competitive sport that requires immense strength and endurance. However, speed and strength can only get an athlete so far. Beyond this, they must rely on strong technique to get them through the race. Every stroke in a race matters and swimmers must constantly run through drills during practice to perfect their strokes. Several multinational companies, such as Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) have signed sponsorship deals with professional swimmers. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) signed a yearly sponsorship deal worth $0.5 million with American swimmer Katie Ledecky in January 2022. Another athlete officially sponsored by Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is the British swimmer Adam Peaty.  14. Figure SkatingWeighted Average Score: 13.6 The main reason why figure skating is such a uniquely demanding sport is that it is simultaneously an athletic and artistic form of creative expression. Both sport and art, athletic display and dance, figure skaters must learn two very different ways of relating to the discipline and then integrate it all seamlessly into one beautiful program. United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) has partnered with the U.S. Olympic Committee for over 35 years and is an official sponsor of the U.S. Figure Skating Team. An official licensee of the team is NBC Sports, owned by the Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). 13. Bull RidingWeighted Average Score: 12.2Straddled atop a 2,000 pound bucking bull is the ideal place to appreciate the perils of bull riding. The bulls used in competitive bull riding are selectively bred for a predisposition to buck, which means they are especially sensitive to any negative stimulus, such as the riders they are trying to buck off. With an estimated rate of injury of 1 every 15 rides, bull riding is a worthy inclusion in our Ranking of the Toughest Sports in the World. Monster Energy, owned by the Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) has been an official sponsor of Professional Bull Riders (PBR) riders and events since 2011. PBR boasts an annual attendance of 3 million fans, and the sport is available in more than 400 million homes on television. 12. Cross-Country RunningWeighted Average Score: 10.5Cross-country athletes are often less visible than other athletes, but cross-country running is definitely one of the hardest sports physically and mentally and requires a lot of dedication and discipline. Cross-country runners are a unique breed who push themselves against their limits. They run during rain or under scorching sun and don’t let their pain get the best of them. The leading fitness technology company Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ:GRMN) signed a two-year deal in 2021, to become the title sponsor of the Garmin RunningLane Cross Country Championships. 11. RugbyWeighted Average Score: 9.4Rugby has been called ‘a thug’s game played by gentlemen’ and on the surface, that description seems to fit the sport. Rugby combines athleticism with toughness and is played without any protective gear. Athletes must exhibit strength, endurance and speed, and with all the tackling and hitting going on, it comes as no surprise that rugby is a part of our Rankings of the World’s Hardest Sports. Each player performs an average of 20 to 40 tackles per match, and an estimated 1 in every 4 players get injured during the season. The BT Group has one season remaining on a three-year deal worth around $140 million with Premiership Rugby. BT Sport will rebrand as TNT Sport and show Premiership and European rugby from next season, following the merger between BT Group and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD). 10. SoccerWeighted Average Score: 9.2Soccer requires an intense amount of stamina, as players usually have to run between 7-10 miles per game. This includes sprinting, sliding, tackling, jumping and the sport also demands keen mental awareness, as players need to continuously read the game as it goes on. Creativity and technique also play a key role in the most popular sport in the world, as a single moment of magic could be enough to make the difference between total ecstasy and despair, for millions. Soccer is also one of the strongest sports in the world financially and has witnessed some juggernaut deals for sponsorships and TV rights. In May 2021, the Premier League confirmed that it would extend its television deal worth approximately $7 billion, until the end of the 2024-25 campaign. Sky Sports, owned by the Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), TNT Sports, owned by Warner Bros., Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Amazon Prime, owned by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are some of the companies that acquired the said TV rights. The Premier League clubs also spent a total of $966 million on transfer fees last season. 9. Water PoloWeighted Average Score: 9.2Next up on our List of Hardest Sports in the World is the high-intensity Olympic sport of water polo. Played in a deep pool of at least 1.8 meters, the water sport is highly regarded in terms of physicality, as there is a lot of kicking and grabbing going on under the surface, other than the throwing and catching happening above it. The speed and durability required by players, as well as the necessity to avoid drowning without being allowed to touch the ground, make water polo one of the Top 10 Hardest Sports in the World. The U.S. Water Polo team has a number of partners and sponsors, including KAP7 and Anti Wave etc. 8. BasketballWeighted Average Score: 8.1Basketball is hard to play because it requires a high level of physical fitness, especially with all the non-stop running that players do up and down the court. Also, basketball skills take a lot of time to master and performing certain actions in the game needs a very high level of accuracy, agility, teamwork and body coordination. Basketball is also the hardest sport to go pro in. Unless you’re above 6 foot 3 inches, you have a very low chance of making it big. Only about 0.008% of high school basketball players turn pro. The NBA currently makes $2.66 billion a year from The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) under its current deal, which will expire following the 2024-25 season. It’s aiming to get twice as much after. 7. WrestlingWeighted Average Score: 6.6Another clear contender in our list of toughest sports in the world, wrestling requires a combination of physical and mental determination, endurance, speed and tactfulness. The best wrestlers train for hours on end in gymnasiums until they’re ready to compete. Some wrestlers also need to cut weight before their matches to meet their required weight class, and many times, this happens through dehydration or consuming a low-calorie diet. In April 2023, Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EDR), the parent company of UFC, announced a deal to acquire World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc (NYSE:WWE) and form a new public company. The deal values UFC at $12.1 billion and World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc (NYSE:WWE) at $9.3 billion. Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EDR) will hold a 51% controlling share in the new company, while shareholders of World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc (NYSE:WWE) will hold a 49% stake. 6. MotocrossWeighted Average Score: 5.5Initially developed from motorcycle trials, motocross is a sport that requires a great amount of skill. Riders perform tricks like leaps, ditches and trespassing, while riding on winding, challenging routes across harsh terrain. It is one of the toughest and most physically demanding sports, with high jumps and often risky landings that frequently result in gruesome injuries and accidents. Monster Energy, owned by the Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), recently extended its Supercross title sponsorship until 2025. The Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) owned energy drink is already the official energy drink of Pro Motocross and Supercross, and the long-term partnership with Supercross began in 2007.Click to continue reading and see the 5 Hardest Sports in the World Ranked.Suggested Article:15 Biggest Stadiums in the World15 Most Valuable Sports Companies in the WorldLebron James Investment PortfolioDisclaimer: None. 15 Hardest Sports in the World Ranked is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
86,cecb9296-50e6-33f4-b5fe-b3d7a69d9337,LUV,2023-06-29,Southwest Airlines Co.'s (NYSE:LUV) Stock is Soaring But Financials Seem Inconsistent: Will The Uptrend Continue?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southwest-airlines-co-nyse-luv-102351992.html,1688034231,STORY,['LUV'],"[Southwest Airlines' (NYSE:LUV) stock is up by a considerable 19% over the past month. But the company's key financial indicators appear to be differing across the board and that makes us question whether or not the company's current share price momentum can be maintained. Specifically, we decided to study Southwest Airlines'  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Southwest Airlines How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Southwest Airlines is:6.4% = US$658m ÷ US$10b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.06 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.A Side By Side comparison of Southwest Airlines' Earnings Growth And 6.4% ROEWhen you first look at it, Southwest Airlines' ROE doesn't look that attractive. Next, when compared to the average industry ROE of 13%, the company's ROE leaves us feeling even less enthusiastic. For this reason, Southwest Airlines' five year net income decline of 40% is not surprising given its lower ROE. We believe that there also might be other aspects that are negatively influencing the company's earnings prospects. For example, it is possible that the business has allocated capital poorly or that the company has a very high payout ratio.Story continuesAs a next step, we compared Southwest Airlines' performance with the industry and found thatSouthwest Airlines' performance is depressing even when compared with the industry, which has shrunk its earnings at a rate of 27% in the same period, which is a slower than the company.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is LUV worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether LUV is currently mispriced by the market.Is Southwest Airlines Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Looking at its LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 32% (or a retention ratio of 68%) which is pretty normal, Southwest Airlines' declining earnings is rather baffling as one would expect to see a fair bit of growth when a company is retaining a good portion of its profits. It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.Moreover, Southwest Airlines has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 17% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 20% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.ConclusionIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Southwest Airlines' performance. While the company does have a high rate of reinvestment, the low ROE means that all that reinvestment is not reaping any benefit to its investors, and moreover, its having a negative impact on the earnings growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care and diagnostic and emergency services.Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.Story continues4 Key Trends Defining Hospital Industry's FutureGrowing Patient Volumes: With declining pandemic-related constraints, seniors are now undergoing delayed elective procedures. Pent-up demand for procedures like hip and knee surgeries is likely to drive patient volumes. Growth in deferred procedures, admissions, outpatient surgeries and Medicare reimbursements are expected to support hospital companies' revenues. However, inflationary pressures and financial constraints can force some patients to delay addressing certain non-emergency medical needs. The benefits of the Affordable Care Act and similar safety nets can provide patients with some respite, which can help them navigate tough times.Expanding Elderly Population: Advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare will enable the senior population to witness constant growth. Over the long run, this will likely expand the demand for hospital services. The U.S. Census Bureau's revised report suggests that people above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the nation's population, signaling an advancement from 17% in 2020 to 21% in 2030.By 2034, older adults are predicted to outnumber children, which will be the first in U.S. history. The median age of the country grew by 0.2 years to 38.9 years during the 2021-2022 period. The change in demographic and the rising incidence of diseases are expected to be industry drivers. Also, the increasing number of people signing up for healthcare plans through the Affordable Care Act indicates fewer challenges to visiting hospitals in the future.Technological Advancements: Technological improvements, innovations and wider adoption will continue to support hospital players. This should optimize hospitals' services, minimize unnecessary costs and elevate the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which are expected to rise in the future as well. The companies are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, along with real-time analytics, to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis that hospitals utilize, which will limit patients' waiting time and reduce their treatment costs.Climbing Expenses: Despite implementing cost-curbing efforts, the rising patient volumes are likely to increase operating costs. Rising prices of hospital supplies due to inflationary pressures will keep margins under pressure. Also, growth-project investments will keep expenses elevated, affecting the bottom line in the short run. However, improving labor shortages and staffing challenges will continue to provide hospital companies some breathing room. Also, contract renegotiations with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Zacks Industry Rank Depicts Promising ScenarioThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

The research showed that PPG Agilon silica provides nearly 50% energy savings and cuts manufacturing time by a third compared to conventional silica by eliminating one mixing step.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230628538256/en/PPG research has demonstrated energy savings and other manufacturing benefits for tire makers with the use of PPG AGILON® performance silica technology. (Photo: Business Wire)PPG Agilon precipitated silica is chemically modified, enabling tire makers to eliminate a manufacturing step required in conventional technology, in which high-density silica undergoes a reaction with silane. Because PPG formulates PPG Agilon performance silica by precipitating silica and silane together, this non-value-added processing step is not required, saving energy and reducing manufacturing complexity.""The research demonstrates that lower energy consumption, reduced mixer wear and increased plant throughput can be obtained when using PPG Agilon silica,"" said Truman Wilt, PPG research and development director, Specialty Chemicals and Materials. ""Working alongside our customers, PPG aims to enhance their manufacturing capabilities and exceed the needs of today’s tire industry, all while helping to meet their sustainability goals.""The new PPG research also found added benefits for tire makers compared to non-treated silicas, including increased mixer fill factor (the ratio between the volume of material put in a mixer, and the total mixer volume), higher silica loadings, reduced mixer temperature, and lower water consumption. There are also significant sustainability benefits for end users: When used in tire treads, PPG Agilon silica also improves fuel efficiency and traction and extends treadwear.Story continues""PPG Agilon silica products are engineered to extend the tire industry’s ‘magic triangle’ including lowering rolling resistance for improved fuel efficiency, increasing traction for improved safety and handling, and durable construction that extends the useful life of tires,"" said Anurag Raj, PPG customer sustainability business partner, Specialty Coatings and Materials. ""The new research shows that PPG Agilon silica can play an even more important role in the transition to sustainable mobility and contribution towards multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals.""The research was presented by Lucas Dos Santos, PPG researcher, Specialty Coatings and Materials, at the recent Tire Tech Expo in Hanover, Germany.

Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.22%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 2.93%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the investment bank had lost 5.25% over the past month. This has lagged the Finance sector's gain of 3.77% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.22% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Goldman Sachs as it approaches its next earnings release, which is expected to be July 19, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Goldman Sachs to post earnings of $7.21 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 6.73%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $11.77 billion, down 0.82% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $31.18 per share and revenue of $47.55 billion, which would represent changes of +3.73% and +0.38%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Goldman Sachs. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988.

Goldman Sachs is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.In terms of valuation, Goldman Sachs is currently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 10.05. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 13.32.Story continuesWe can also see that GS currently has a PEG ratio of 0.85. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account.

Jared, let's take a look at some of these movers here. We have a couple of names for you, starting it off with Micron. We're looking at a gain of just about 3 and 1/2% in extended trading, move here to the upside, following their better-than-expected results after the bell here this afternoon, beating for the third quarter. The guidance was also strong. And the company saying, the CEO saying, that the memory chip industry has past its bottom in revenue. Obviously, a good sign here from Micron and also the industry at large.The upbeat forecast is certainly a sign that the glut is easing, something that Micron and many of its peers has been struggling with in recent months. And the better-than-expected results and guidance coming despite some of those headwinds challenges that the company is facing over in China. And we know China crackdown on Micron chips, China-- Micron is saying that it is a challenge here for the company moving forward, but they still see strong demand here in the US and elsewhere. Shares up just about 13% over the last three months.Let's flip it over to the three banks that we're tracking here. Bank of America, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs, all moving to the upside in after-hours trading. These banks plus all of its peers, all 23 of the largest US lenders, passing the Fed's stress test. Now, they can withstand-- proving that they can withstand any sort of severe recession. This, of course, leading the way to future payouts, payout announcements. Those, though, might be a while. Several of these banks have indicated that they are waiting for more clarity on the new capital structures before they announce. You're looking at Bank of america that stock up almost 2%.Story continuesRounding it out with Overstock. That stock also to the upside here in extended trading. A couple of headlines coming out from the company, Overstock, saying that it plans to launch Bed Bath &amp; Beyond online in Canada, followed by US weeks later. The US launch is going to include a refreshed website, mobile app, and also the loyalty program here. Now, remember, Overstock was the winning bidder here for Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's assets. They paid 21.5 million bucks for that.And you look at the seven-day move here in the stock. You can see the big spike that we saw just around Thursday of last week once that was announced. Over the last seven days, booking gains of about 16%.JARED BLIKRE: Yeah. Overstock, so many people have counted that stock out for so many different reasons over the years, short attacks by short sellers. Still cooking there.]"
97,ce491143-c580-49d7-9060-58e05c06aebf,GS,2023-06-29,All 23 banks survive Fed's 2023 stress test,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/all-23-banks-survive-feds-2023-stress-test-203007760.html,1687984207,STORY,"['BAC', 'USB', 'C', 'TFC', 'WFC', 'SCHW', 'JPM', 'GS']","[All 23 US banks that participated in a new Federal Reserve stress test would be able to withstand a severe global recession, demonstrating the strength of the biggest financial institutions at a time when the banking industry still is on uncertain ground.Results released by the Fed Wednesday show that these banks would have enough capital on hand to absorb losses and continue lending even if unemployment were to hit 10% and the stock market were to plunge 45%.Their projected losses would amount to $541 billion under that hypothetical scenario.The biggest of the group — JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Bank of America (BAC), Citigroup (C), Wells Fargo (WFC), Goldman Sachs (GS), and Morgan Stanley (MS) — all would have capital buffers well in excess of the Fed’s 4.5% minimum requirement under this extreme scenario.The same goes for the mid-sized regional banks that were a part of this test, including PNC (PNC), Truist (TFC), and M&amp;T (MTB).""Today’s results confirm that the banking system remains strong and resilient,"" Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr said.""At the same time, this stress test is only one way to measure that strength. We should remain humble about how risks can arise and continue our work to ensure that banks are resilient to a range of economic scenarios, market shocks, and other stresses.""Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Results did vary widely across the industry, however. The bank with the highest capital ratio under the Fed’s “severely adverse scenario” was Charles Schwab (SCHW), one of the lenders that came under a lot of investor scrutiny earlier this year as other banks stumbled.The bank with the lowest ratio was Citizens Financial (CFG), a regional bank based in Rhode Island. Other regional banks such as US Bancorp (USB) and Truist also ended the test with smaller buffers than their giant rivals.But the giants of the industry also posted the biggest projected net income losses under the Fed’s “severely adverse scenario,” led by Citigroup's $34.9 billion. Wells Fargo had $32.9 billion and JPMorgan had $30.1 billion.Story continuesGoldman, perhaps the most storied name on Wall Street, had the highest amount of estimated losses from commercial estate loans and credit cards.It also recorded the highest losses in separate Fed assessments of how the trading books of the biggest banks would perform under “global and exploratory market shocks.”Tougher rulesThe Fed’s test, an annual rite of the industry since the 2008 financial crisis, is the first to be released since turmoil roiled the banking world following the failure of First Republic, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank this spring.Banks typically use the results of the annual Fed stress tests to determine how much they should have on their balance sheet to absorb shocks and how much they have left over for dividends and buybacks. Some banks are expected to make announcements late Friday about how much money they now plan to return to shareholders.But banks are also bracing for a new set of higher capital requirements from the Fed that will force some of them to hold even greater buffers against losses.These tougher rules were already in the works before the collapse of several regional banks in the spring, but regulators made it clear in the wake of those troubles that they wanted to make sure their new approach applied to mid-sized institutions similar in size to a First Republic or a Silicon Valley Bank. Both had more than $200 billion in assets at the time of their failures.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week he does not expect smaller community banks to be subject to the higher capital requirements, which are expected to be proposed sometime this summer. Institutions with at least $100 billion in assets may have to comply.Forcing banks to amass greater buffers has pros and cons for lenders, regulators, and the economy. It will increase the stability of these institutions, but it will also make it more difficult to earn robust profits and could cause banks to pull back on certain types of lending.Powell discussed this balance last week.“It’s always a trade-off,” he said. “More capital means more stable, resilient banking systems. It can also at the margins mean less credit availability…there is no perfect way to assess that balance.”Barr, the vice chair of supervision, said last week the Fed is also exploring ""reverse stress testing"" that could be used as a tool to make banks more resilient by helping supervisors recognize more exogenous issues that could go wrong instead of patterns from the past regulators have been trained to catch.Meeting a testThe Fed first started applying stress tests to a wide group of banks in 2009 as the last financial crisis was still raging.It was mandated annually by law for institutions with more than $100 billion in assets as part of legislation that passed in 2010. A law passed in 2018 tailored the tests by banks’ size, meaning those in the range of $100 billion-$250 billion would be tested every other year.Democrats and regulators have been critical of that 2018 adjustment, arguing it could have helped prevent the problems that amassed at Silicon Valley Bank, which had not been subjected to a stress test before it failed.Silicon Valley Bank was seized by regulators on March 10. REUTERS/Brittany Hosea-Small (Brittany Hosea-Small / reuters)Some in this year's test — BMO Financial, Citizens, M&amp;T, and RBC US Group — were among the every-other-year banks that weren’t scheduled to be tested again until 2024.But the Fed required BMO, Citizens, and M&amp;T to be tested again in 2023, and RBC also opted in to the 2023 exam. All four banks had capital of 6.4% and higher, above the 4.5% required.This year the Fed examined how 23 banks would fare under a severe global recession that included severe stress in commercial real estate. In such a scenario unemployment spikes to 10%, home prices and commercial real estate plunge about 40%, the stock market plummets 45%, market volatility jumps and corporate bond yields rise.All 23 banks in aggregate would have lost $541 billion. Yet they would still have capital equal to 10.1% of total assets weighted by risk. Well above the 4.5% the Fed requires.The biggest lossesThe $541 billion in total projected losses includes more than $100 billion from commercial real estate and residential mortgages and $120 billion in credit card losses, both higher than the losses projected in last year’s test.The banks with the biggest commercial real estate losses were Goldman, with $16 billion, followed by Morgan Stanley ($13.7 billion) and Citizens ($12.4 billion).Goldman also had the highest credit card losses, with $24.7 billion, followed by Capital One ($22.2 billion) and TD Group ($21.4 billion).Goldman Sachs headquarters, at right. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Eight banks with large trading operations were also tested against a ""global market shock"" tied to their trading positions. For the first time, this year's test also tested the trading books of those banks against a second ""exploratory market shock.""The Fed said the global market shock was a severe recession with fading inflation expectations; the exploratory market shock tested a less severe recession with greater inflationary pressures.The results from those exams showed that the trading books of the largest banks were resilient amid a rising rate environment.The biggest projected losses belonged to Goldman, with $21.2 billion lost in the global market shock scenario and $18.1 billion in the exploratory market shock component.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The proliferation of EVs has not only enabled start-up automakers with enormous potential to be formed and begin selling tens of thousands of vehicles, but EVs have sped up the digitalization of automobiles. As a result, they’ve facilitated automakers’ ability to sell subscriptions to various apps and services. This has led to the rise of leading EV stocks to buy.Similarly, the development of autonomous transportation has opened up new revenue streams to automakers, including robotaxis, subscriptions to semi-autonomous driving systems, and the use of autonomous vehicles to ship products. Given all of these points, leading EV stocks that are also well-positioned to benefit from  developing and marketing autonomous-driving systems are, in my view, great stocks to buy.The combination is perhaps best exemplified by Chinese electric-vehicle maker Xpeng (NYSE:XPEV), which recently rolled out its self-driving system in Beijing.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsXpeng (XPEV)Electric car backlit by cyan blue neon light next to EV charger with cyan blue light and lightning bolt symbol, all against a black background. ev stocks to sell nowSource: shutterstock.com/JLStockOn June 15, Xpeng rolled out a software update enabling some of its vehicles to self-navigate through Beijing’s streets, according to The South China Morning Post. The company’s autonomous-driving software, X NGP (Navigation Guided Pilot), is now operational in the four largest cities in Asia. Xpeng aims to launch it in dozens of cities by the end of 2023.Some media outlets compare X NGP to Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Full Self-Driving system, labeling it as “semi-autonomous.” However, I think these descriptions undersell Xpeng’s groundbreaking offering.I base this view on two reasons. Firstly, Xpeng’s G9 EV will soon operate as robotaxis on all general testing roads in Guangzhou, a Chinese city.Secondly, Xpeng CEO Xiaopeng He stated on May 24, alongside Xpev’s Q1 results, that the system matches the driving abilities of a novice driver. With each update, its “driving experience” will improve by a year.Story continuesHe also claimed that X NGP is a year ahead of its competitors. He predicted that by the end of 2023, the system would need human intervention only once “or fewer” on highways.BYD (BYDDF)The driver of the electric car inserts the electrical connector to charge the batteries. Electric vehicle chargerSource: Marian Weyo / Shutterstock.comChina-based BYD (OTC:BYDDF) is the world’s leading seller of EVs if plug-in hybrids are included in the category. As a result, it is certainly one of the world’s leading EV stocks.In recent months, the automaker has begun a big push in the autonomous-driving area. Specifically, it has recruited “between 4,000 and 5,000 software engineers” while creating “an intelligent driving research division” to bring all of its engineers working on such systems together in the same locations, Reuters indicated.  The company told the news service that it would unveil autonomous-driving innovations in “two to three years.”Given BYD’s extremely impressive success in the EV space and its huge cash pile of over $66 billion as of the end of last quarter, I’m confident that it will unveil an impressive autonomous-driving system.Meanwhile, BYD has huge opportunities in overseas markets, as its exports jumped 500% in 2022, and it still has yet to meaningfully penetrate both Western markets and those in Southeastern Asia and India, Seeking Alpha columnist Manuel Paul Dipold recently noted.The stock has a very low trailing price-sales ratio of 1.46.Aptiv (APTV)Yellow electric vehicles at the charging station.Source: Ronald Rampsch / Shutterstock.comAptiv (NYSE:APTV) “develops advanced electrical systems including autonomous driving software for automobiles.” The company’s autonomous-driving joint venture with Hyundai, Motional, lost $1.15 billion from 2020 to 2022.However, Motional looks poised to  start generating large returns on investment for Aptiv over the longer term. That’s because, late last year, “Motional and Uber…reached a 10-year deal to deploy robotaxis across multiple markets across the U.S.”Given Uber’s tremendous reach and high sales in the U.S., the agreement should hugely boost Motional’s financial results, greatly lifting Aptiv’s top and bottom lines in the process.In February, Aptiv reported that it anticipates that its sales would climb over 30% between 2022 and 2025, while its operating profit would “more than double” during the period.Given that information, Aptiv’s forward price-earnings ratio of 23 is very attractive.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of XPEV.

Yet, concerns related to reliance on third parties and data security threats persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has lost 18.6% compared with the 23.3% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 14.6% growth in the said time frame.The renowned medical device and in-vitro diagnostics technology provider has a market capitalization of $424.8 million. Surmodics projects 44.3% growth for fiscal 2024, expecting to maintain its strong performance. SRDX’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 21.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Consistent Efforts to Boost R&amp;D: Surmodics’ solid efforts to improve its R&amp;D stature have been a key growth driver, which raises our optimism. The company’s whole product solutions pipeline and sirolimus-based below-the-knee drug-coated balloon program deserve mention. Surmodics has been making progress using its internally developed .014 balloon platform.On its second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call in April, Surmodics’ management stated that the company has begun limited market evaluations for the Pounce Venous Thrombectomy system and Sublime Radial Access microcatheter.Thrombectomy Prospects Bright: Surmodics’ aim to leverage its proprietary Pounce thrombectomy platform technology to develop products raises our optimism. In June, the company received the FDA’s approval for the SurVeil drug-coated balloon. The same month, Surmodics received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for its Pounce LP (Low Profile) Thrombectomy System.Strong Q2 Results: Surmodics’ better-than-expected results in second-quarter fiscal 2023 buoy optimism about the stock. The company registered a solid uptick in the overall top line. It also saw robust revenues from its Medical Device segment, as well as from its Product sales, and Research, development and other revenues. During the quarter, Surmodics witnessed strong contributions from sales of its Pounce and Sublime products, indicating their continued solid demand.Story continuesDownsidesReliance on Third Parties: A principal element of Surmodics’ business strategy is to enter into licensing arrangements with medical devices and other companies that manufacture products incorporating its technologies. The revenues it derives from such arrangements depend upon its ability or its licensees’ ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, market and sell products incorporating Surmodics’ technologies. Its failure or the failure of its licensees to meet these requirements could have a material adverse effect on Surmodics’ business.Data Security Threats: Surmodics collects and stores sensitive data, including its proprietary business information, on its networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to its operations and business strategy. Despite Surmodics’ security measures, its information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, resulting from employee error or other disruptions.Estimate TrendSurmodics is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has narrowed from $1.93 to $1.85.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $26.9 million, suggesting an 8.1% improvement from the year-ago reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The company launched a slew of products in recent months. Progress in its transformation plan, growth initiatives and planned divestitures will provide MYGN with a foundation for consistent, long-term growth and profitability. However, escalating expenses and a competitive space are worrisome.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has increased 23.7% against the 8.4% fall of the industry and the 13.2% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned genetic testing and precision medicine company has a market capitalization of $1.86 billion. The company has estimated earnings growth of 100% compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 16.69%. Myriad Genetics surpassed estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in the other two, delivering an average negative earnings surprise of 65.13%.Let’s delve deeper.TailwindsHuge Potential in Oncology Testing: In the first quarter of 2023, Myriad Genetics’ Oncology business generated $77.6 million in revenues, with test volumes being approximately 50,000. Prolaris continued to see strong demand as first-quarter testing volumes increased 22% year over year. Hereditary cancer testing volume in oncology grew 16% year over year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDuring the first-quarter earnings update, MYGN noted that FirstGene is complementary to the company’s current prenatal portfolio and targets more than one million patients in the United States. The company is preparing for a launch in the fourth quarter of this year. MYGN is also planning to expand its suite of precise oncology solutions, with the launch of a liquid biopsy test for tumor profiling in the second half of 2023.Product Launches: Last month, Myriad Genetics announced the addition of Folate Receptor Alpha to its Precise Oncology Solutions portfolio. In the first quarter, Myriad Genetics launched a unified ordering portal for women's health business to simplify the ordering process for customers, especially for those ordering more than one Myriad product.Story continuesThe company also collaborated with one of the largest independent outpatient medical imaging providers in the United States, SimonMed Imaging, to launch a new hereditary cancer risk assessment program. MYGN’s expanded partnership with Illumina will broaden its emerging biopharma business and access to HRD testing in the United States.Transformation Growth Strategy Progresses Well:  In the first quarter of 2023, the company added many experienced leaders to the group to help drive growth even further with improved operational efficiencies.MYGN continues to enhance its core commercial organization with prudent investments in technologies and innovations and is excited about FirstGene Myriad Genetics’ next-generation prenatal offering. Recently, the company announced a partnership with ClinVar.DownsidesQ1 Negatives: In the first quarter, Myriad Genetics registered a gross margin contraction and an operating loss due to mounting costs and expenses, which is concerning. Adjusted operating expenses for the quarter reflected investments in sales and marketing programs, technology, R&amp;D, additional operating expenses from Gateway Genomics and inflationary pressures.Increasing Competition: Per management, MYGN expects competition to intensify in its current fields with recently observed advancements in technology. In our opinion, competitive headwinds might push down the prices of the high-priced tests provided by Myriad Genetics. This might deter margin improvement going forward.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MYGN’s 2023 loss per share has remained constant at 33 cents in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $738.9 million.

Yahoo Finance Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down what analysts are saying.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]JARED BLIKRE: Shares of Netflix in the green today, following a price target hike at Oppenheimer. The investment bank raised its outlook to the streaming giant up to $500 a share. And that's up from $450. Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal is here with more. Alexandra, give us the details, please.ALLIE CANAL: Yeah, Jared. The bulls are out when it comes to Netflix. Now, Oppenheimer's Jason Helfstein now joins three other analysts for that $500 price target, which is a second highest price target on the street-- Cowen's John Blackledge, Guggenheim's Michael Morris, and Wells Fargo Steve [INAUDIBLE] with that $500 price target. But Pivotal Research currently has the highest outlook on Wall Street at 535 bucks a share, so potentially even more room to run on this stock, which is already up more than 45% year-to-date.As you're seeing on your screen now, according to data from Bloomberg, Netflix has about 28 buy ratings, 24 holds, and just four sells. Now, Helfstein cited a few areas of growth for the company like the bullish data surrounding the password sharing crackdown. He also called out the possibility of the company discontinuing its lowest priced ad-free plan. They're currently testing that in Canada.If they do that, Helfstein argues that would boost average revenue per subscriber and unlock about $4.4 billion in annual revenue. He also called out the ongoing writers strike and how that could serve as a near-term tailwind, given Netflix's long programming lead time, deep library, and exposure to more international content, which is currently not impacted by the strike. It won't be that's just based in the US.And then another thing to note is we're seeing industry wide layoffs across the board in media. And he wrote to in his note to clients, quote, ""Netflix is largely benefiting from media job cuts as competitors struggle amid ad market weakness and subscription services cash drains."" So a lot of tailwinds for this company, especially at a time when we're seeing a lot of users turn to streaming for their overall TV viewership as opposed to cable and some of those other competitors.Story continuesJARED BLIKRE: Allie, Netflix got me.

The first half of year has been a colossal disappointment for those who hoped for a rebound from a rocky 2022, with a slowdown in streaming subscriptions.Even the magic of the Walt Disney Company is fading. For almost two decades, Bob Iger was the 'King of Hollywood' as he transformed the legendary entertainment company with the game-changing acquisitions of Marvel, Pixar and Lucasfilm. After a disastrous two-year tenure of his successor, Iger is back for a second reign as CEO, but the Disney he came beck to is long the same: the legacy businesses are in decline, the streaming business is losing money and as a consequence, the share price has slumped.Disney Is No Longer The SameCreative output is the lifeline of Disney and Iger’s leadership has always been all about content. Disney Plus was supposed to be Iger’s grand move prior to his departure. Instead, Iger is now facing a troubled company that just laid off 7,000 employees, that is pulling programming from streaming services to save on costs and the animation business is no picnic with the latest Pixar movie “Elemental” being a financial flop with the lowest opening weekend gross since Toy Story debuted in 1995. Unsurprisingly, shares are struggling over the last five months. But even Iger’s legacy is now in question as there’s no clear growth narrative ahead on how Disney aims to restore the magic to its kingdom.Netflix Is Rising AgainNetflix sparked enthusiasm with a crackdown of password sharing that could potentially lead to tens of millions of signups. Unlike Disney, Netflix shares surged over the past five months and even outpaced the S&amp;P 500. Netflix is setting the stage for its next phase of content growth by trimming costs and boosting engagement. CFRA analyst Ken Leon told Yahoo Finance that international content is Netflix's biggest competitive advantage over its rivals. Earlier this week, Netflix Co-CEO Ted Sarandos confirmed the company’s $2.5 million commitment to fund original Korean content over the next four years, with plans to add Korean unscripted series and movies to its original programming. Generally speaking, productions outside the U.S. tend to be cheaper without sacrificing quality. Most importantly, the demand for international content is there and so is the acceptability within the US audience. Live sports is certainly another dimension that Netflix can exploit but in its own unique approach as it produced sports-adjacent content like ""Formula 1: Drive to Survive"" without committing to big-ticket deals.Story continuesThe Prolonging Hollywood Strike Is Actually Good News For NetflixFriday may bring more bad news for Disney as film and TV actors will be joining the strike if writers don’t strike a deal with Hollywood studios by then. If Hollywood comes to a shutdown, Netflix will be the beneficiary as it continues to churn out international content that is unaffected by the strike.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

This is expected to be of great help to businesses, especially small ones.Notably, Business Prime Duo is an Amazon Business membership that used to cost $69 per year previously. It allows the business customers or the ones who buy for businesses to access business-only pricing and avail of free One and Two-Day Delivery and free Same-Day Delivery facilities.Moreover, Amazon Business with Business Prime Duo will help business owners save more and keep their personal and business expenses separate while enjoying Prime entertainment benefits and other perks.Additionally, business customers will be eligible to choose their own Amazon Day to receive orders on the same day every week. They will also be able to avail consolidated shipping facility on eligible large orders.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote Move to BenefitWe believe the latest move will likely aid Amazon in attracting businesses, especially small business owners, to its platform.This, in turn, will boost the adoption of Prime membership as well as Amazon Business.Notably, the Prime program remains a key catalyst for AMZN’s top-line growth, backed by customer-friendly offers and cashback benefits. Further, strengthening delivery and shipment services and expanding music and video content, plus a robust loyalty system, are constantly boosting Amazon’s Prime subscriber base.All the benefits aid Amazon in delivering better shopping experiences to its Prime members.We believe the growing adoption of Prime will drive the company’s subscription revenues, which have been acting as key drivers for the e-commerce giant for the past few years.Amazon witnessed 15% growth in its subscription service sales, which were $9.7 billion in first-quarter 2023.Growing momentum across subscription services is expected to continue driving the company’s overall top-line growth.For 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $560.32 billion, reflecting growth of 9% from 2022.We believe that the strengthening financial performance of the company will likely raise investor optimism about the stock.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Newmont Corporation (NEM) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.53 a share, just 26 days from its upcoming earnings release on July 24, 2023.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.53 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.49 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Newmont Corporation has an Earnings ESP of 8.9%.NEM is one of just a large database of Basic Materials stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Dow Inc. (DOW).Slated to report earnings on July 25, 2023, Dow Inc. holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $0.74 a share 27 days from its next quarterly update.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Dow Inc. is $0.71, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 4.26%.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, NEM and DOW could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The award has been offered by the U.S. Army Contracting Command, Detroit Arsenal, MI.Valued at $257.6 million, the contract is projected to be completed by Oct 18, 2025. Work related to this deal will be carried out in Sterling Heights, MI; Anniston, AL; and Lima, OH.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?Military tanks are the primary offensive weapons in land combat missions. An efficient armored military tank enables the army to carry out any mission by direct fire. The recent clash between Ukraine and Russia has accelerated the pace of upgrading the defense landscape with technologically advanced arms and ammunitions. This, in turn, has led to increased investments in military tanks.It is imperative to mention here that the increased focus on technologically advanced combat vehicles is likely to benefit General Dynamics as its Land System business unit is a prime contractor of land combat vehicles like M10 Booker. This is a highly lethal, survivable and mobile direct-fire combat vehicle, featuring an enhanced thermal viewer, a large-caliber cannon, a lightweight hull and turret, and a modern diesel engine, transmission and suspension system.General Dynamics’ expertise and in-depth experience in building and supporting combat vehicles, coupled with a customer-first focus and a seasoned supply-chain network, have helped it in winning multiple contracts from the U.S. Army and its allies. The latest contract win is a bright example of that, which, in turn, should boost GD’s revenue generation prospects.Growth ProspectsThe changing dynamics of the military landscape and the rising geopolitical tension make it mandatory for a country to continuously evolve and strengthen its defense structure. Military tanks form an integral part of military missions, arming them in their land warfare affairs.Story continuesPer a report from Markets and Markets firm, the global armored vehicle market is projected to witness a CAGR of 3.1% during 2022-2027.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the casino and gambling industry, you can go directly to the 5 Most Profitable Casinos in the World.After a devastating period during the COVID-19 pandemic, the casino industry has shown great signs of recovery. The global economy is slowly adjusting to the aftereffects of the pandemic, and gamblers and tourists are returning to gambling hubs such as Las Vegas and Macao.The Global Gambling Industry: An AnalysisAccording to a report by Research and Markets, the global gambling industry was valued at $449 billion in 2022, and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6.6%, reaching a valuation of $847.5 billion by 2032. The Asia Pacific was the leading region in the gambling market, accounting for 32.4% of the revenue of the global market in 2022. North America, Western Europe and other regions followed the APAC region. It is anticipated that North America and Western Europe will experience the fastest growth over the forecasted period, with projected compound annual growth rates of 32.2% and 22.8%, respectively. Additionally, South America and Eastern Europe will grow at compound annual growth rates of 8.3% and 1.7%, respectively.Casino locations massively depend on gambling laws and tax rates. The U.S. and China are two of the biggest gambling countries in the world. In the U.S., gambling laws are flexible as compared to those in China. China allows only Macao and Hong Kong to be legal places for gambling and casinos, whereas gambling is legal in almost all U.S. states.The Casino Hotel Industry in the U.S.A major chunk of the global market of casinos lies in the entertainment hub of Las Vegas. Another report from Research and Markets posted data on the casino hotels business in the United States. As per the report, in 2022, average industry sales in the U.S. were $70.9 billion and the average sales per company were $279.1 million. Additionally, the report pointed out that over the past 3 years, the industry has grown at an annual rate of 4.3%.Story continuesThe casino and gambling market is growing swiftly each year. In 2022, it was the period of recovery for most of the casino firms. The trends in the gambling industry are changing with the rise of online gambling and the emergence of online gambling stocks. When we talk about casinos, the United States is the first country that comes to our minds. Las Vegas is considered the epicentre of world-leading casinos. Hong Kong and Malaysia also have some of the most profitable casinos in the world. Additionally, Macao is emerging as a new hub for the gambling market. The Asian market is mainly focused around the southern coast of China.European Gambling Market on The RiseThe European gambling market is skyrocketing, especially in the UK. According to the data cited by The Guardian, the UK is the largest regulated online gambling market in the world. In comparison to the US market, the UK market reported a total gross gaming revenue of GBP 9.07 billion in 2021, surpassing the US which posted GBP 7.79 billion.Casino companies’ performance has improved after the pandemic and their stocks are also pulling off exceptionally well. Moreover, as the spending of the gambling industry is highly correlated with the overall progress of the economy, casino stocks may also be some of the best consumer discretionary stocks to invest in.Some of the biggest gambling companies in the world include Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS), Wynn Resorts, Limited (NASDAQ:WYNN), and Caesars Entertainment (NASDAQ:CZR).Casino companies have once again started to make investments following a gap during COVID-19 pandemic. Since we have highlighted some of the most popular gambling companies, let's take a look at some notable earnings. On April 19, Las Vegas Sands Corp. (NYSE:LVS) posted stellar earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $0.28, surpassing EPS estimates by $0.08, and its revenue amounted to $2.12 billion, outperforming revenue estimates by $286.59 million. After a strong beat, Las Vegas Sands Corp.'s (NYSE:LVS) is focusing on growth opportunities and looks optimistic about future developments. Here are some comments from its Q1 2023 earnings call:“The results speak for themselves. There is a powerful recovery underway in Macao in both gaming and the non-gaming segments. The future looks very good for both markets. Our commitment to investing in both Macao and Singapore has never wavered.We're excited to have the opportunity to develop -- to deploy more capital to expand our non-gaming offerings in Macao. The $3.8 billion commitment we made as part of the concession tender is just the baseline. We will invest more in this extraordinary market. I look forward to everyone having the opportunity to see, to witness The Londoner and the Four Seasons. The quality of our new products is exceptional.Marina Bay Sands delivered EBITDA of $394 million for the quarter. Mass win was an all-time property record of $549 million. Rolling volumes have nearly equalled the 2019 level. Our $1 billion suite and casino renovation program is progressing. More suite inventory will continue to come online throughout the remainder of the year. We will have 400 suites available by the end of 2023, up from just 150 prior to our renovation.It's very exciting. I don't know that in any of our markets, we had a quarter with this amount of EBITDA recovery this quickly after opening. So that's a good indicator. And so, I think we're very excited about that. I think, it's hard to call these things are -- it's -- I wish we had a crystal ball, but I think at this point, we look at the recovery and it's very encouraging.”12 Most Profitable Casinos in the WorldPixabay/Public DomainMethodologyIn order to determine the most profitable casinos in the world, we took into account the profitability of their parent companies. For casinos owned by private companies, we relied on annual revenue or the available annual metric to quantify their profitability. For casinos owned by public companies, we considered the net income.We sourced the annual net income for the most recent fiscal year from Macrotrends, and for casinos owned by private companies, we sourced their financials from official annual reports and press releases. We then chose each profitable casino company's flagship casino and ranked them in ascending order of the profitability of their parent companies.Net income was prioritized for gauging a company's profitability, so privately owned casinos are ranked earlier in the list, and as we move up, we will find publicly owned casinos.12 Most Profitable Casinos in the World12.

Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, suggesting that ZTS could be poised for a continued surge.The bullish case only gets stronger once investors take into account ZTS's positive earnings estimate revisions.

127,f76e1820-abfa-3c8f-84e6-76f512e3607b,ZTS,2023-06-29,"If You Invested $1000 in Zoetis a Decade Ago, This is How Much It'd Be Worth Now",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/invested-1000-zoetis-decade-ago-123007686.html,1687955407,STORY,['ZTS'],"[How much a stock's price changes over time is important for most investors, since price performance can both impact your investment portfolio and help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Zoetis (ZTS) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ZTS for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Zoetis' Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Zoetis' main business drivers.Florham Park, NJ-based Zoetis Inc. came into existence following Pfizer’s decision to spin off its animal health business. The entity started trading on NYSE on Feb 1, 2013, under the name Zoetis. The company is a leader in the animal health space with a focus on both livestock and companion animals in seven major product categories: vaccines, anti-infectives, parasiticides, dermatology, other pharmaceutical products, medicated feed additives and animal health diagnostics. Zoetis has a diversified business, which caters to eight core species — cattle, swine, poultry, fish and sheep (collectively, livestock) and dogs, cats and horses (collectively, companion animals).The outstanding growth rate in the companion animal medicines, vaccines and diagnostics sector is being driven by economic development, related increases in disposable income and a rise in pet ownership and spending on pet care.Zoetis has been working on strengthening its product portfolio through acquisitions and deals. In 2022, the company completed the acquisition of Jurox, an animal health company based in Australia, which brings the company a range of companion animal and livestock products and provides the company with future growth opportunities, manufacturing capacity and increased capabilities in Australia. Also in 2022, the company acquired Basepaws, a petcare genetics company that provides pet owners with genetic tests, analytics and early health risk assessments, which help pet owners and veterinarians understand an individual pet’s risk for disease and can lead to more meaningful engagements and increased likelihood of early detection and treatment of disease.Zoetis has consolidated its four-region structure into a two-region structure, namely the United States and International. Total revenues grew 4% year over year to $8.1 billion in 2022. The United States contributed 53% of total revenues in 2022 while international revenues contributed the rest.In 2022, Zoetis’ two top-selling products and product lines were Simparica/Simparica Trio and Apoquel, which contributed approximately 12% and 10%, respectively, of its revenue. Also in 2022, Zoetis recorded 15 products and product lines with revenues of $100 million or more.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Zoetis ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in June 2013 would be worth $5,528.67, or a gain of 452.87%, as of June 28, 2023, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.Compare this to the S&amp;P 500's rally of 171.41% and gold's return of 49.18% over the same time frame.Going forward, analysts are expecting more upside for ZTS. Zoetis has an innovative portfolio of pet care parasiticides, including Simparica Trio and key dermatology products that maintain momentum for the company. The strong uptake of Librela and Solensia in Europe, its new monoclonal antibody therapies for osteoarthritis pain in dogs and cats, is encouraging. The launch of innovative products bolstered the portfolio and should fuel growth. The recent approval of the Apoquel chewable tablet for dermatitis indication should boost sales. However, the company had earlier faced supply challenges which impacted demand. Despite constraints being eased out, a similar situation will restrain growth. Stiff competition from animal health business wings of Merck and Bayer remains a woe. Shares have outperformed in the industry in the year-to-date period. Our estimates for Zoetis’ revenues suggest a CAGR growth of 7.4% over the next three years. The stock has jumped 6.05% over the past four weeks. Additionally, no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 6 higher, for fiscal 2023; the consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

After BlackRock submitted an application for a Bitcoin spot ETF in mid-June, a slew of other asset managers followed suit, including WisdomTree and Invesco. Now, Mastercard has joined the fray.On Wednesday, in perhaps one of its most ambitious crypto-related announcements yet, the payments giant said it was planning to launch a beta in the U.K. over the summer to test what it calls the Multi Token Network, or an “app store powered by blockchain technologies for building regulated financial applications,” Raj Dhamodharan, a Mastercard executive vice president and the firm’s head of crypto and blockchain, told Fortune.Like Apple’s app store, which provides developers with tools to help them create applications to run on, for example, an iPhone, Mastercard’s Multi Token Network, or MTN, will give developers access to tools the payments company has steadily built out in the past few months, including a private version of the Ethereum blockchain on which Mastercard will encourage developers to build new applications.“A lot of the things people cover and talk about these days in crypto are the regulatory aspects of it and all the technology and investment as an asset and so forth,” Dhamodharan told Fortune. “We actually think the underlying technology that powers many of the innovations that have happened over the years is actually quite useful.”Mastercard’s unveiling of MTN follows its prior crypto announcements, including its forays into non-fungible tokens, crypto-linked credit and debit cards, and crypto infrastructure. (It recently released Crypto Credential, a developer tool that lets users from one crypto wallet easily find users on another wallet, along with other pertinent information.)“It is a natural evolution that demonstrates Mastercard’s commitment to offering a wider range of payment solutions,” Dhamodharan wrote in a blog post announcing the beta.Story continuesA MTN of toolsAs part of its blockchain “app store,” Mastercard unveiled a number of tools developers can use to build new “regulated” financial applications.Dhamodharan told Fortune that programs on top of Mastercard’s private instance of the Ethereum blockchain can be written in Solidity, the programming language native to Ethereum, or accessed through any programming language that can connect to an API, a gateway for developers to access data from an organization or individual.Developers will be able to plug into Crypto Credential to verify users’ identity and know whether their wallets, for example, can receive NFTs. And Dhamodharan told Fortune that Mastercard will let developers enrolled in the beta play around with tokenized commercial bank deposits, or records on the blockchain that state how much cash someone has in their bank account.Perhaps the simplest application a programmer can build, Dhamodharan told Fortune, is one that lets two consumers send money to each other. “But we’re really hoping that it will be a lot more than that,” he added. “For example, you could build an application for making a payment for an NFT, and an NFT could represent any asset.”While this sounds a lot like existing applications on, for example, the public version of Ethereum, Mastercard’s intervention is that, as opposed to the Wild West of crypto where developers often pay little attention to existing laws and regulations, the payments firm hopes to create a new financial network that plays by the rules. Ultimately, it wants to do what it’s done for traditional payments—but for crypto.“If the technology has promise,” Dhamodharan told Fortune, “we should find a way to make that work.”This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

Paige McGlauflin here, taking over for Amber.Those who’ve read our most recent Fortune @ Work playbook know A.I. is poised to transform how we work. While HR teams are in varying stages of A.I. adoption, with some still at the most embryonic stage, Mastercard is among the companies heavily promoting A.I. use in its people function. The payment processing company’s HR head said as much at a panel hosted by the human capital advisory firm The Josh Bersin Company last week.One tool Mastercard’s HR team adopted early is an A.I.-based game used to vet candidates. The game doesn’t record demographic data, instead advancing candidates to the next interview round solely based on whether they can complete specific tasks. Michael Fraccaro, Mastercard’s chief people officer, says the game helps reduce the risk of unconscious bias in hiring.Mastercard also uses Microsoft Teams, which provides insight into how much time employees allocate to a particular activity like messaging, how much time they spend in meetings and with whom, and suggestions like offering to schedule an email in the future. In addition, the company utilizes an automatic scheduler to streamline setting up interviews, creating an 87% productivity bump, Fraccaro said.Like many employers, his team is testing ChatGPT to write job descriptions, but he cautions that whatever it produces requires vetting since recruiters and hiring managers are still “accountable for what goes out there to the market.” Mastercard employees can use the chatbot for experimental and learning purposes but are restricted from using it for client purposes.Many companies have similar policies, including PwC’s Australian division, which encourages employees to experiment with ChatGPT but prohibits them from using any material supplied by ChatGPT and sharing firm or client data with the tool.For more on how companies harness A.I.'s full potential in the workplace, check out our robust Fortune @ Work playbook.Story continuesPaige McGlauflinpaige.mcglauflin@fortune.com@paidionThis story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits.Currently, InterDigital has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), while Qualcomm has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell). This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that IDCC is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is just one factor that value investors are interested in.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.IDCC currently has a forward P/E ratio of 11.44, while QCOM has a forward P/E of 14.51. We also note that IDCC has a PEG ratio of 0.82. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. QCOM currently has a PEG ratio of 0.93.Another notable valuation metric for IDCC is its P/B ratio of 4. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, QCOM has a P/B of 6.78.Story continuesThese metrics, and several others, help IDCC earn a Value grade of B, while QCOM has been given a Value grade of C.IDCC is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model.

147,327d6c31-278b-318c-bbe1-d2721d3c67d8,EXPE,2023-06-29,Tripadvisor Tests Instant Book (Again),Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tripadvisor-tests-instant-book-again-171223659.html,1687972343,STORY,"['TRIP', 'EXPE', 'BKNG', 'COF']","[This story began with a promotion featured in an email from my credit card company, Capital One, and it took me aback: “Save up to 30% off on your Instant Book hotel with Tripadvisor.”WHAT?If you aren’t an online travel nerd, or don’t work in the industry, you may not understand my shock, but many of you who read this column will “get it” right away.Capital One cardholders can earn 10% cash back on this offer when booking an Instant Book hotel on Tripadvisor. That means they can book the hotel right on Tripadvisor.com or its apps. Source: Capital OneAlthough it may have appeared sporadically over the years, Tripadvisor largely abandoned Instant Book in 2017, and the strategy reversal was a big deal at the time.Why?When Tripadvisor markets hotels, it largely does so as a metasearch site. In metasearch, online travel agencies and hotels bid to list their hotel rates on Tripadvisor, and have to pay a pre-determined cost per click when consumers select them and get redirected to their websites for booking.But with Instant Book six or seven years ago, Tripadvisor was trying to be much more like an online travel agency in that travelers could book the hotel without having to leave the Tripadvisor platform.At the time, the Instant Book initiative was a key strategy plank for Tripadvisor, but the hotel industry and some online travel players didn’t adopt it in a big way. On the one hand, some hotels welcomed the idea of Tripadvisor becoming more powerful as a marketing platform to blunt the power of Google, Expedia and Booking.com. On the other hand, many hotels and online travel agencies wanted consumers to visit their platforms directly without having to rely on a third party like Tripadvisor.Tripadvisor’s abandonment of Instant Book in 2017 landed with a thud.But now, under CEO Matt Goldberg, who took up his post last year, replacing Steve Kaufer, Tripadvisor is resurrecting Instant Book, or at least testing another go-round, although there are some notable twists.Story continuesSource: TripadvisorIn this prominently placed search result for Library Hotel in New York City on Tripadvisor this morning, the Instant Book feature is the one from Tripadvisor itself ($472), as opposed to offers from Expedia.com ($472), Priceline ($524), and Hotels.com ($472).One of the advantages to travelers — just like it was in the previous Instant Book incarnation — is that if they choose the Instant Book offer from Tripadvisor itself, they can complete the booking right there. If they choose Expedia, Priceline or Hotels.com, they would first be redirected to those websites to search some more before completing a booking.It’s Actually an Expedia PartnershipFor the uninitiated in the complexities of online travel, this next statement may be mind-boggling. If you click Book &amp; Get Rewards, then on the next page, where you insert your name and credit card details, you’ll learn that this particular Tripadvisor Instant Book deal actually comes through a partnership with Expedia.If travelers complete the booking on Tripadvisor, the booking details will be available on Tripadvisor, but Expedia will be the merchant of record on their credit cards, send the email confirmations, and handle customer service. Tripadvisor is not in the customer service business for these sorts of things.This was how it worked in the older versions of Tripadvisor Instant Book, as well.But here are what appears to be a couple of twists in this new test. Most of the Instant Book reservations several years ago required travelers to pay immediately instead of when they arrive at the hotel. In the Library Hotels example, consumers wouldn’t have to pay anything at the time of booking, could cancel without penalty by July 19 for a July 26-28 reservation, and would only have to shell out some money when they arrived for their stays.Another new element in this Tripadvisor-Expedia partnership for Instant Book is that Tripadvisor stated that the booking would be eligible for rewards (from credit card companies like Capital One).In the world of online travel, where companies are constantly testing what works best to get consumers to book, this Instant Book listing could vanish before I finish writing this sentence. Or Tripadvisor might resurrect it for real.To be determined.Tripadvisor downplayed the Instant Book appearance.“This isn’t a strategic shift, but just a recent example of a partnership model that we’ve operated for years,” said spokesperson Duncan Skehens. “We regularly work with affiliate partners in this capacity in the U.S., as it offers a reliable way to accurately track and attribute campaign performance. And, while nothing has changed from a wider strategic perspective, we’ll continue to focus on and expand our work with affiliate partners.”What it does say about the new Tripadvisor regime is that the company has a lot of things on the table and is willing to test and learn to see what sticks.   Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.04%. At the same time, the Dow lost 0.22%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 2.93%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the aerospace and defense company had gained 1.16% over the past month. This has lagged the Aerospace sector's gain of 4.47% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.22% in that time.Lockheed Martin will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Lockheed Martin is projected to report earnings of $6.41 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 222.11%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $15.78 billion, up 2.15% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $27.09 per share and revenue of $65.76 billion, which would represent changes of -0.51% and -0.34%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Lockheed Martin. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Our research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.Ranging from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), the Zacks Rank system has a proven, outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks returning an average of +25% annually since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection remained stagnant. Lockheed Martin is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Looking at its valuation, Lockheed Martin is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 16.73. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 16.25, so we one might conclude that Lockheed Martin is trading at a premium comparatively.Story continuesAlso, we should mention that LMT has a PEG ratio of 2.72. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Aerospace - Defense industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 1.82 as of yesterday's close.The Aerospace - Defense industry is part of the Aerospace sector.

149,cd9062a1-24b4-3b71-9b61-b8f652feb7bc,LMT,2023-06-29,Investors Met With Slowing Returns on Capital At Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-met-slowing-returns-capital-130109409.html,1687957269,STORY,['LMT'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. So when we looked at Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), they do have a high ROCE, but we weren't exactly elated from how returns are trending.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Lockheed Martin, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$7.5b ÷ (US$55b - US$17b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Lockheed Martin has an ROCE of 20%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Aerospace &amp; Defense industry average of 9.9%. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Lockheed Martin compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Lockheed Martin here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEThere hasn't been much to report for Lockheed Martin's returns and its level of capital employed because both metrics have been steady for the past five years. It's not uncommon to see this when looking at a mature and stable business that isn't re-investing its earnings because it has likely passed that phase of the business cycle. So while the current operations are delivering respectable returns, unless capital employed increases we'd be hard-pressed to believe it's a multi-bagger going forward. This probably explains why Lockheed Martin is paying out 49% of its income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Unless businesses have highly compelling growth opportunities, they'll typically return some money to shareholders.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayIn summary, Lockheed Martin isn't compounding its earnings but is generating decent returns on the same amount of capital employed. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 73% over the last five years. But if the trajectory of these underlying trends continue, we think the likelihood of it being a multi-bagger from here isn't high.Lockheed Martin does have some risks though, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin  that you might be interested in.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Builders FirstSource, Inc. BLDR, Panasonic Holdings Corp. PCRFY, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM and Vipshop Holdings Ltd. VIPS.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:Asset Utilization Ratio Adds Layer of Safety to Stock PicksMarket watchers have been pointing to various signs that indicate a recession is unavoidable. And these sounds have been growing louder ever since the Fed’s commentary that further rate hikes should not be ruled out.One is the inversion of the yield curve -- when the yield on short-term treasury bonds exceeds the yield on long-term treasury bonds. This indicates that investors anticipate increased uncertainty in the near term, and is a sign of falling investor confidence. It has also preceded every recession in the past 50 years.They’re also watching market performance. The S&amp;P 500 for instance is down around 8% from its highest point in the last five years. Similarly, the Nasdaq is down over 15% from its highest point. While there are a lot of ups and downs in these graphs, these declines further strengthen the thesis that investors are growing nervous.Third, GDP has been weak. The GDP growth rate has languished in the last four-five quarters, staying well below 2% in each of the last four. Agriculture and construction have been particularly weak, with mining, transport and services seeing relative strength.Retail sales growth has been negative in two of the last five quarters. While it grew a dismal 0.3% in May, there’s a good chance of its slowing in the coming months. Ecommerce appears to be a relatively bright spot. Therefore, consumer spending could be slowing down.While the job situation is not bad and employment remains at historic lows, wage growth is moderating. Therefore, we can’t deny that a recession, or at least a soft landing, appears to be around the corner and investors would do well to be prepared for it.Story continuesThis could therefore be just the right time to be getting into “safe” stocks.The most common way of identifying the safety of a stock is by checking its growth prospects and valuation. If there’s a dividend thrown in, all the better. I will be showing in this article how you can use the asset utilization ratio to add another layer of safety.First let’s see what makes this significant. Most companies deploy a certain amount of capital to build some assets. These assets are then utilized to generate revenue. How much they’re spending depends on the industry and the level of technological development it is part of. Additionally, some of the capital is used in building inventories to allow the company to better address demand.Asset utilization ratio basically tells you how efficiently a company is using its assets. It may be impacted by things like holidays and downtime for compulsory maintenance, but also by inefficiencies or weak demand for the company’s products, or weak pricing power. When there is sufficient demand but the company still has underutilized assets, it’s obvious that there are inefficiencies.A well-run company would have acceptable levels of utilization of its assets. In general, we see that a utilization above 70% is good enough. If there is overutilization of physical assets, that too could be negative because it would unduly increase wear and tear, and therefore, maintenance costs.So if you’re looking for safe stocks, you could make asset utilization part of your strategy. Just select a Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) rated large-cap stock. When this stock also belongs to an attractive industry, you further increase our chances of success. That’s because Zacks buy-ranked stocks have been seen to perform particularly well when they also belong to the top 50% of industries as classified by Zacks. Additionally, large-cap stocks usually have proven business models and steady cash flow streams. Therefore, their market prices tend to fluctuate less, especially in conditions of increased uncertainty.Next, check how brokers view the stock. If most of the brokers, or even an average number of brokers have a Buy rating on the stock, investors will have more confidence in it, which will lend stability to prices.The third point is the subject of this article. If the asset utilization is more than 70% (0.7), chances are the company doesn’t have an unreasonable amount of idle capacity. This in turn means that there is proper asset utilization, and therefore, efficient operations.Finally, it makes sense to buy stocks that trade below their intrinsic value.A list of stocks that satisfy these criteria is provided below:Builders FirstSource, Inc.Dallas, TX-based Builders FirstSource manufactures and supplies building materials, manufactured components, and construction services to professional homebuilders, sub-contractors, remodelers and consumers in the United States.The Rank #1 stock belongs to the Building Products - Retail industry (top 7%). The #1 rank captures the effect of positive estimate revisions, which implies positive sentiment of analysts.And sure enough, the average broker rating of 1.73 translates to a Buy rating from brokers.The asset utilization is very high at 1.87. The number is inflated by the significant value of intangible assets added to the balance sheet during its merger with BMC Stock Holdings. However, both inventory and receivables turnover are attractive. Therefore, it’s apparent that the company manages its asset utilization efficiently.At 13.29X P/E, the shares are undervalued both with respect to the industry (17.94X) and the S&amp;P 500 (19.16X).Panasonic Holdings Corp.Kadoma, Japan-based Panasonic develops, manufactures, sells and services various electrical and electronic products into residential, automotive, connectivity industrial, and energy markets.The Rank #1 stock belongs to the Audio Video Production industry (top 23%).Brokers have an average rating of 2.00 on the stock, which means a Buy rating.The asset utilization of 1.03 is attractive, and reflects the fact that the industry is not a capital intensive one, such as you would find for an energy or utility stock,At 12.40X earnings, the shares are trading at a discount to both the industry (15.10X) and the S&amp;P 500.PulteGroup, Inc.Homebuilder PulteGroup is headquartered in Atlanta, GA. It acquires and develops land primarily for residential purposes and constructs single-family detached, townhomes, condominiums and duplexes on such land. It also provides related financing and other related services.The Rank #1 stock belongs to the Building Products - Home Builders industry (top 8%).Most brokers have a Buy rating on the stock, as seen from their average rating of 1.67.The asset utilization of 1.16 is attractive, particularly because the company does have a considerable amount of asset outlay. It should not be considered excessive, since most of this is fixed assets like land and buildings rather than machinery, which would suffer wear and tear.At 8.52X earnings, the shares are trading at a discount to both the industry (10.36X) and the S&amp;P 500.Vipshop Holdings Ltd.Headquartered in Guangzhou, China, Vipshop Holdings operates online platforms vip.com, vipshop.com as well as Shan Shan retail outlets in China through which it provides products and financing for consumers and suppliers. It also offers warehousing, retail, procurement, and IT support activities for sellers.The Rank #1 stock belongs to the Internet - Delivery Services industry (top15%).Most brokers have a Buy rating on the stock, as seen from their average rating of 1.89.The asset utilization of 1.74 is attractive. Technology companies employing digital infrastructure can have higher asset utilization at times. When they are building out the infrastructure, utilization will be lower, but as it becomes operational, utilization can pick up strongly. It depends a lot of the popularity of the platform.At 9.612X earnings, the shares are trading at a discount to both the industry (14.07X) and the S&amp;P 500.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

152,e50a6829-0c31-30c0-84d4-9ded97ee9bf8,PHM,2023-06-29,Here's Why PulteGroup (PHM) is a Great Momentum Stock to Buy,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-pultegroup-phm-great-160007808.html,1687968007,STORY,['PHM'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at PulteGroup (PHM), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of A. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. PulteGroup currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for PHM that show why this homebuilder shows promise as a solid momentum pick.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor PHM, shares are up 3.75% over the past week while the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry is up 1.87% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 17.96% compares favorably with the industry's 14.2% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of PulteGroup have increased 34.66% over the past quarter, and have gained 97.32% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 10.45% and 13.94%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to PHM's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. PHM is currently averaging 2,823,265 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with PHM.Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PHM's consensus estimate, increasing from $9.13 to $9.30 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that PHM is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep PulteGroup on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company is due for a pullback from this level.On this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.Taylor Morrison has a Value Score of A. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and F, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of A.Story continuesIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 7X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 10.4X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 4.6X versus its peer group's average of 5.5X. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.Zacks RankWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Taylor Morrison currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.Since we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Taylor Morrison fits the bill. Thus, it seems as though Taylor Morrison shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.How Does TMHC Stack Up to the Competition?Shares of TMHC have been soaring, and the company still appears to be a decent choice, but what about the rest of the industry? One industry peer that looks good is PulteGroup, Inc. (PHM). PHM has a Zacks Rank of # 1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of B, a Growth Score of B, and a Momentum Score of A.Earnings were strong last quarter. PulteGroup, Inc. beat our consensus estimate by 32.02%, and for the current fiscal year, PHM is expected to post earnings of $9.30 per share on revenue of $15.14 billion.Shares of PulteGroup, Inc. have gained 18% over the past month, and currently trade at a forward P/E of 8.46X and a P/CF of 6.73X.The Building Products - Home Builders industry is in the top 9% of all the industries we have in our universe, so it looks like there are some nice tailwinds for TMHC and PHM, even beyond their own solid fundamental situation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(PHM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pultegroup-inc-phm-attracting-investor-130010035.html,1687957210,STORY,['PHM'],"[PulteGroup (PHM) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this homebuilder have returned +18%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry, which PulteGroup falls in, has gained 16.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.PulteGroup is expected to post earnings of $2.46 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -9.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.30 points to a change of -13.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.16 indicates a change of -1.5% from what PulteGroup is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.8%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PulteGroup is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of PulteGroup, the consensus sales estimate of $3.94 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +0.4%. The $15.14 billion and $15.52 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -6.7% and +2.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPulteGroup reported revenues of $3.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.2%. EPS of $2.35 for the same period compares with $1.83 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.27 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +9.42%. The EPS surprise was +32.02%.Over the last four quarters, PulteGroup surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PulteGroup is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PulteGroup. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Last year was challenging for the overall stock market and particularly for growth stocks. On the other hand, dividend indexes and portfolios focused on dividends performed relatively well. Some even managed to achieve a small gain during that period. This year, the stock market has experienced a shift in investing style as growth stocks are reasserting their dominance over dividend stocks. However, this does not indicate that dividend stocks have lost their appeal as income generation and compounding growth continue to be the prime focus of investors this year as well.Evaluating the growth rate of dividends over multiple years can provide an understanding of the contribution of dividend stocks to long-term wealth creation. Increasing dividends mean shareholders receive larger cash payments over time. This growing income stream can be particularly beneficial for individuals who rely on dividend income for living expenses or as a source of regular cash flow. Moreover, companies that raise their payouts regularly have outperformed the market historically. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 consecutive years of dividend increases, has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by over 75% since 1989. Some of the best long-term stocks in this regard are Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).Also read: 14 Best Stocks for Long Term GrowthAnalysts have expressed a positive view of dividend stocks and exchange-traded funds in 2023 because of their long-term impact on returns. They believe that dividend funds are a safer choice because they invest in companies that have strong financial positions and healthy cash flows. These factors make them more likely to withstand economic downturns and remain resilient. Christopher Huemmer, senior vice president at FlexShares Exchange Traded Funds, highlighted the significance of dividend stocks while speaking with Reuters in April. He said:Story continues""Though we have experienced periods where the capital appreciation of a stock’s price has dwarfed the return from dividend income, the power of dividends should not be overlooked as a crucial component of equity performance.""He further stated:""In volatile markets, dividends can act like the keel of a sailboat, providing a level of stable return in choppy seas.""The historical evidence consistently supports the substantial contribution of dividend stocks to overall market returns. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we reported Hartford Fund’s data, which showed that dividend income represented 41% of the S&amp;P 500’s total return on average from 1930 to 2022. We also reported that from 2000 to 2009, the S&amp;P 500 experienced negative returns due to the dot-com bubble burst in March 2000. Despite this, dividends provided a positive annualized return of 1.8% during that period. The fact that dividend income has accounted for a considerable portion of the S&amp;P 500's total return emphasizes the significance of dividends for long-term investors, who prioritize generating regular cash flow from their investments.12 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and selected companies that have raised their dividends for 15 consecutive years or more.

In terms of pricing, the company currently anticipates that realized MOP prices at the mine will be toward the low end of its earlier expectation of $325-375 per ton.

Realized Diammonium phosphate (DAP) prices on a FOB basis are anticipated to be at the high end of its guided range of $550 to $600 per ton.

164,7498be20-3f3f-3587-b3e3-fb7945688c32,ROK,2023-06-29,3 Robotics Stocks to Buy With Explosive Upside Potential,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-robotics-stocks-buy-explosive-111500326.html,1687518900,STORY,"['PATH', 'ISRG', 'ROK']","[Over the next decade, the robotics industry is likely to have a big impact on economic output and productivity. Be it industrial automation, construction, mobility or healthy, robotics will provide increased efficiency and accuracy. With plenty of growth to come, it’s a good time to look at some of the top robotics stocks to buy.To elaborate on the industry’s potential, the global robotics market was worth $25 billion in 2021. Boston Consulting Group expects the market size to swell to $160 to $260 billion by 2030. Of this, industrial robotics is likely to be worth $60.6 billion.If these estimates hold true, stocks of some of the best robotics companies will be big-time value creators. I expect multi-bagger returns from some of the best robotics stocks over a period of five years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis column will discuss three robotics stocks to buy that seem to be best positioned to benefit from these tailwinds.PATHUiPath$16.08ISRGIntuitive Surgical$327.61ROKRockwell Automation$314.98UiPath (PATH)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website homepage of UiPath (PATH).Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.comUiPath (NYSE:PATH) is a provider of robotic process automation solutions. PATH stock looks attractive, after trading sideways over the last 12 months. I expect a big breakout to the upside, as the company delivers strong numbers.For Q1 2024, the company reported revenue of $290 million, which was 18% higher on a year-over-year basis. For the year, the company has guided for revenue of $1.27 billion. I believe that there are two important points to note with these numbers.First, UiPath invested $75.3 billion in research and development for the quarter. The company released its latest platform (2023.4), which leverages the power of AI to discover automation opportunities. Investment in R&amp;D will continue to provide UiPath an edge over its competitors over time.Second, the company reported positive operating cash flow of $67.3 billion for the quarter. With robust revenue growth, it’s likely that operating cash flows will swell over time. This will provide ample headroom for larger investments in innovation, spurring a nice flywheel for the company and investors.Story continuesIntuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a technology leader in robotic-assisted, minimally invasive surgery. Notably, ISRG stock has surged 72% over the last 12 months. I believe that intermediate corrections would be a good opportunity to accumulate the stock, as this is a long-term holding in the robotics space worth picking up on the cheap.Why?Well, mostly due to the company’s da Vinci surgical system. This system is Intuitive’s most popular product, with 12 million procedures performed on the system to date. For Q1 2023, Intuitive reported revenue of $1.7 billion. An important point to note is that 81% of the revenue was recurring. As the company’s product installed base swells globally, recurring revenue will increase. This provides clear cash flow visibility for investors, something that’s hard to come by in this sector.It’s also worth noting that the company’s da Vinci system installed base stands at 4,668 in the United States. Outside the country, the installed base is 3,111. This fact implies that Intuitive has a strong global presence, something of a diversifier for investors concerned about U.S.-only exposure.With a massive potential addressable market, the recurring revenue potential for the company is huge.Rockwell Automation (ROK)Rockwell Automation sign is seen in Cambridge, On, Canada. ROK stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockRockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) is a company that’s already in a full-on bull market rally, surging more than 20% year-to-date, at the time of writing. I’ve remained bullish on this stock as a long-term play, and that hasn’t changed.As an overview, the company’s products and solutions cater to the manufacturing and mining industry. Their focus is on digital transformation, industry analytics, and industrial automation control. Specific to robotics, the company is partnering with robot makers to deliver control software with the latest robot technology.Rockwell has been delivering healthy growth, and I like the fact that the company has strong global presence. For Q2 2023, the company reported 31.8% year-on-year growth from Asia Pacific. However, the region contributes to only 15% of total sales. With robust growth expected in emerging markets, Rockwell’s revenue outside North America will continue to swell.It’s worth noting that for the first six months of 2023, Rockwell reported free cash flow of $197.7 million. With healthy growth, I expect free cash flows to swell, which will translate into higher dividends for investors over time.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

KMI, MPLX LP MPLX and The Williams Companies Inc. WMB.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:3 Midstream Stocks to Watch in a Choppy Energy MarketThe initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The price of crude oil plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020. However, with the rapid development of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Currently, WTI oil price is trading at more than $65 per barrel.The business model of most energy players, by its inherent nature, is exposed to extreme volatility in commodity prices. Hence, it would be wise for investors to focus on midstream stocks like Kinder Morgan, Inc., MPLX LP and The Williams Companies Inc.Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks in midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk, which indicates considerably less exposure to oil and gas prices and volume risks.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks belonging to the midstream energy space that are well poised to gain, and hence investors should keep an eye on these. All the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continues3 Stocks to Keep an Eye OnKinder Morgan: With its operating interests in oil and gas pipeline networks spread across 83,000 miles, KMI is a leading energy infrastructure company in North America. It derives most of its earnings from take-or-pay contracts, generating stable fee-based revenues.Kinder Morgan is poised to grow on the back of its business model, which is relatively resilient to volume and commodity price risks.MPLX: The firm has ownership and operating interests in midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, thereby generating stable cashflow. With a strong focus on returning capital to unit holders, MPLX repurchased $491 million of common units last year. Under its unit repurchase authorization, the partnership has yet to buy back the remaining $846 million of its units.The Williams Companies: It is well-poised to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy since it is engaged in transporting, storing, gathering and processing natural gas and natural gas liquids.With its pipeline networks spread across more than 30,000 miles, The Williams Companies connects premium basins in the United States to the key market. WMB’s assets can meet 30% of the nation’s natural gas consumption, which is utilized for heating purposes and clean-energy generation.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year.

175,7cb72147-bc66-400b-aef7-e7249673b972,CI,2023-06-29,PwC report: Medical costs to increase by a whopping 7% in 2024,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pwc-report-medical-costs-to-increase-by-a-whopping-7-in-2024-171645746.html,1687972605,STORY,"['CI', 'CVS', 'NONOF', 'NVO', 'UNH']","[The cost to treat patients will rise an estimated 7% in 2024, which is bad news for insurance premiums in the next year, according to a new report from PwC.The big increase comes on top of more than 6% growth this year, compared to 2022, and 5.5% growth in 2022.Key drivers of the cost growth: the hot weight loss drug space and new gene therapies — the latter of which can cost millions of dollars — as well as increased consolidation in the hospital and care facility space.The weight loss drugs are especially hitting employers' pocketbooks, and insurers are balking at coverage for use as an obesity treatment, though they continue to cover Type 2 diabetes patients.For example, weight loss company Found's CEO Sarah Simmer told Yahoo Finance recently that employers have seen Novo Nordisk's (NVO) Ozempic jump to the No. 1 cost in drugs they are paying for, with one employer confiding that Ozempic prescriptions are up 400% year over year.A pharmacist displays a box of Ozempic, a semaglutide injection drug used for treating type 2 diabetes and made by Novo Nordisk, at Rock Canyon Pharmacy in Provo, Utah, U.S. March 29, 2023. REUTERS/George Frey REFILE - CORRECTING MONTH (George Frey / reuters)But that's just one pressure point. Like other industries, the inflationary environment and worker shortages are also pressuring the industry, causing increased costs to be felt through all parts of the broader health system.""All health plans ranked inflationary impacts on health providers among the top three inflators for 2024. In a persisting high inflationary environment, hospitals and providers will often be pushed to seek significant rate increases from payers,"" the PwC report authors said.That, in turn, could affect what insurers charge for premiums, according to Kaiser Family Foundation's Larry Levitt.""There are cost pressures bubbling up throughout the health care system, and those higher costs will translate directly to higher premiums for employers and individuals,"" said Levitt, executive vice president of health policy.But, he added, ""While employers have historically tried to shift premium increases onto workers, that may be difficult in the current labor market with unemployment so low.""Story continuesAnd while the impact of inflation might be receding in other industries, it could only just be starting in healthcare.Ambulances are seen in front of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC., United States on December 08, 2022. (Photo by Celal Gunes/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) (Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)In addition, the drop in Medicaid enrollees as a result of the end of the pandemic, and funding from the government, could increase the number of Affordable Care Act marketplace plan enrollees. While those individuals could be eligible for subsidies, the cost of utilizing the health plans will again add to the costs for insurers.But it's not all bad news. There are some small moves helping to neutralize the cost burden, according to the report.That includes more biosimilars on the market, which means cheaper options are available for patients and insurers, as well as more healthcare providers participating in relationships with insurers to receive bundled payments rather than individual fees for each service provided within a visit (known as value-based care). All of this helps to incrementally decrease the cost burden.In addition, thanks to the pandemic, the use of costly care sites like hospitals has decreased.""With the increased demand for home-based services and virtual care, the healthcare delivery system has reached a new phase. Plans are factoring in higher utilization of less expensive care settings and virtual care when pricing their 2023 plans and beyond, helping plans offset the trend inflators,"" the authors wrote.All told, if inflation and worker shortages persist, it could result in continued pressure on a struggling industry that is slow to adopt innovative changes.""Organizations need to reshape strategies, reengineer financial, workforce and business models and seize every transformational opportunity — from investments in innovation and technology to deals — to clear the path for a drastically different cost, capabilities and business footprint by 2030,"" the report said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"
176,900e1649-d66f-34b7-a9e2-9edeb06f0050,CI,2023-06-29,Here is What to Know Beyond Why Cigna Group (CI) is a Trending Stock,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-beyond-why-cigna-group-130006558.html,1687957206,STORY,['CI'],"[Cigna (CI) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this health insurer have returned +13.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, which Cigna falls in, has gained 6.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Cigna is expected to post earnings of $6.03 per share, indicating a change of -3.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.81 points to a change of +6.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $28.28 indicates a change of +14% from what Cigna is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cigna is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Cigna, the consensus sales estimate of $47.13 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.7%. The $188.88 billion and $225.67 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.6% and +19.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCigna reported revenues of $46.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.4%. EPS of $5.41 for the same period compares with $6.01 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $45.52 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.11%. The EPS surprise was +3.44%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cigna is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cigna. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To see more of these stocks, you can go directly to see the 5 Semiconductor Stocks To Watch During A Potential Tech Pullback.Tech Rally Or Tech Pullback?As the month of June draws to a close, the financial markets are beginning to get concerned about the tech rally that has been taking the S&amp;P 500 by storm so far this year. Many professionals have begun stating that a tech pullback may be fast approaching, which is beginning to scare off investors with billions locked in tech stocks. On June 27, Alex Kantrowitz, Big Technology Founder, was invited on CNBC to share his thoughts on the future of tech stocks in the second half of 2023 in light of these concerns.Kantrowitz noted that the valuations of several tech stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), have been skyrocketing so far this year, even as interest rates also continue to rise. At the time of his interview, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was trading at $410.02. According to Kantrowitz, one way to view such rising valuations is to ask why nothing so far has managed to stop them from continuing their upwards progress. On the other hand, one can also consider the fact that most big tech companies are seeing significant multiple expansions in 2023. Kantrowitz commented that these bigger multiples signal that there is a chance of there being a tech pullback. Here are some of his comments from the interview:""Fundamentally, you look at it, it makes you a little nervous. Then you also say 'what's the market done until now?' It's kept buying.""Kantrowitz's comments truly highlight how many investors are approaching the rising tensions within the tech sector amid concerns of a pullback. While experience and fundamentals may signal to them that a pullback may be on the horizon, most are unable to truly consider this possibility considering the market's continuing optimism surrounding the tech sector. Later in the interview, Kantrowitz offers some insights into what has been helping the tech industry maintain its momentum until now. In his eyes, the narrative surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), particularly after the launch of ChatGPT, has been mostly carrying the tech stocks. He noted the following:Story continues""We've seen this run-up in tech stocks and it's largely been based on an AI narrative. The narrative that we start talking to computers, they start talking back to us, all of a sudden the narrative is that it's gonna change the world. And it very well might. But what's happened since the introduction of ChatGPT? There's been a lot of cool consumer experiments, or prototypes. But have we seen the one or two market-changing, world-changing applications that's made everything that you do different the same way that the iPhone did? Because that's basically what the market is betting. We haven't seen it.""According to Kantrowitz, the above spells out danger for the tech industry. He believes that if the narrative surrounding AI changes from the market considering it as a ""world-changing"" technology to just considering it as a ""cool"" technology, this would be ""bad news"" for both the tech industry and the market at large.How Tech Pullback Concerns Are Impacting Stocks In The SectorSeveral stocks in the tech industry have begun feeling the market's uncertainty in light of more discussions surrounding a potential pullback. On June 26, CNBC briefly showed how several semiconductor stocks, such as Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), had actually declined for the day in light of these concerns by 8% and 9%, respectively. These stocks are among the best semiconductor stocks in 2023, as we mentioned in one of our previous articles. However, the changing market dynamics are signaling that investors should begin monitoring them more closely at this time. Additionally, it may also be wise to look closely at undervalued semiconductor stocks and the fastest-growing semiconductor companies at this time.At the same time, on June 27, CNBC's TechCheck showed how pullback concerns have begun heating up AI deals, leading to more companies jumping into partnerships and acquisitions. Examples include the recent partnership between NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW) and the $1.3 billion acquisition of MosaicML by Databricks. It was also noted that while these deals are beginning to heat up, several tech stocks are beginning to lose their gains heading into the last week of June.The discussion above implies that while the tech industry is continuing to hold on, there are many stocks within it that investors should begin inspecting more closely. It may also be a good idea to begin monitoring the performance of semiconductor stocks, which began falling on June 26, to ensure that tech investors are not taken by surprise if a pullback does come about. In light of the uncertainty in the market today, we have compiled a list of some semiconductor stocks to watch as the situation develops further.10 Semiconductor Stocks To Watch During A Potential Tech PullbackPhoto by Slejven Djurakovic on UnsplashOur MethodologyTo compile our list below, we selected semiconductor stocks that were popular among hedge funds during the first quarter of 2023 by using Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for that quarter.

Morningstar Equity Analyst David Swartz breaks down how Nike's market share in both the U.S. and China could contribute to its earnings print while facing supply chain and inventory headwinds.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]JARED BLIKRE: Nike set to report fourth-quarter earnings tomorrow, wrapping up its financial year on what is expected to be a high. Despite concerns of consumer spending slowing down, the brand outperformed estimates in February, with 14% sales growth.Our next guest expects a similar outcome tomorrow and says the stock is undervalued. David Swartz is a Senior Equity Analyst at Morningstar. David, thank you for joining us here. So broadly speaking, what are you expecting?DAVID SWARTZ: I think we're looking for relatively moderate growth, about 3%. I'm at 2.9% sales growth for the quarter. My EPS estimate is $0.69. In recent weeks, we've seen some analysts reduce their estimates a little bit. I have not done so. I think that Nike can make that number. Nike has a history of meeting or exceeding analyst expectations.Although there are some headwinds certainly, we are looking at a slowing consumer right now, slowing-- spending on apparel in both the United States and Europe as well. But you know, that is also counterbalanced by the increase in sales in China that are likely due to the restrictions-- to the lifting of the COVID restrictions at the beginning of the year.SEANA SMITH: David, when it comes to the sales out of China, do you think it's going to be strong enough to offset some of the headwinds that you just mentioned that's happening right now in North America?DAVID SWARTZ: Yeah, I do. You know, the expectations are not very high. 3% sales growth for Nike is pretty moderate by historical standards. And that's with the benefit of China. You know, so I don't think expectations are really that sky high for the quarter. And I think in recent weeks, people have become even more pessimistic. So I think actually the upside potential is there, because Nike does have a history of outperforming.Story continuesJARED BLIKRE: One more question on China. We've seen this escalation of-- I'm not going to call it a trade war, but maybe tit for tat in terms of us export restrictions on chips. And this kind of hearkens back to the trade war, the actual trade war, the seeming nature of it we had with the previous administration, where China would in fact kind of retaliate on an item by item basis with every new announcement with the US. What is the danger that we re-enter that kind of environment and China decides wholesale that it's going to start blocking US companies like Nike or-- not hurting them, but I guess not enabling them to do business as they were in the past?DAVID SWARTZ: It definitely is a risk. Nike has lost some market share to Native Chinese brands in the last few years, especially Anta and Li Ning. However, their products are still priced well below those of Nike in general. And Nike still is the number one leader in market share.Nike has lost share because of trade restrictions but also the controversy over forced labor in western China that has affected Nike and as well as some other international brands. But Nike has really bounced back, I think, from that pretty well. Nike has something like 8,000 stores in China. Most of them are franchised. And I don't see the Chinese government or anybody else really preventing Nike from continuing to be the number one sportswear brand in that market.Nike still has a very strong grip on worldwide sports. And that's not going to change.SEANA SMITH: David, there's lots of questions just about the extent of the pressure that we could see on Nike's wholesale business. We know that that has been an aggressive focal point here for Nike recently. And then inventory levels, you mentioned the fact that some analysts have lowered their estimates going into these results. A lot of that talk has been on inventory levels and maybe Nike doesn't have as great of a grip on inventory as they seem to have after the most recent quarter. What do you think?DAVID SWARTZ: Nike's inventories last year were definitely out of control. In the second half of calendar 2022, there was a big increase. Nike at one time was basically getting shipments for about three seasons at the same time. So there were some problems. And those have not been completely resolved.I do think that the situation is getting better. And that's what we're hearing from retailers. We've had mixed reports from some retailers that do a lot of business with Nike, like Dick's Sporting Goods and Foot Locker. Dick's I think is doing pretty well. Foot Locker had a pretty negative report. And, you know, for the most part, I think that the market is not in great shape, but it's in better shape than it was six or nine months ago. I think Nike is in the same situation where it is in better shape. But it's inventories are not really where they should be.JARED BLIKRE: Are there any lingering concerns over supply chain constraints, labor shortages, any of the things that we're hearing about in 2021, 2022? are those carrying over? Is Nike still feeling the effects of that? Or has it largely moved on?DAVID SWARTZ: Those impacts, I think, are largely in the rearview mirror. There has been some slowing in consumer spending in the last few months, I think, which probably has impacted Nike. But I don't think that the shipping problems really are an issue anymore. Certainly, input costs are lower. Cotton prices are lower. Oil prices are lower. And that's a benefit for Nike and other apparel firms.JARED BLIKRE: What are some of the deals, especially with sports endorsements, that Nike is really hanging its hat on, kind of been a hallmark of their advertising campaigns in the past? How is this fitting into their current business model?DAVID SWARTZ: Nike still dominates and endorsements. They still have many of the top athletes. Obviously, Nike has a big relationship with LeBron James and, of course, Michael Jordan, as well as a lot of top athletes in international football and track and field. Nike will still get most of the top athletes that are out there, because Nike is the biggest. They can always outbid others when a great athlete comes. Out and their endorsement deals are in play. Nike usually does get those, and I don't see that changing at all.SEANA SMITH: All right. Well, we will get Nike results after the bell tomorrow. We'll have a free live here on Yahoo Finance. David Swartz from Morningstar, thanks.]"

It is seeking to put in place a new set of higher capital requirements, known as Basel 3, that will force some to hold greater buffers against losses.These tougher rules were already in the works before the collapse of several regional US banks in the spring. In the wake of those troubles, regulators made it clear that they wanted to make sure their new approach applied to institutions similar in size to First Republic or a Silicon Valley Bank. Both had more than $200 billion in assets at the time of their failures.Powell said last week he does not expect smaller community banks to be subject to the higher capital requirements, which are expected to be proposed sometime this summer. Institutions with at least $100 billion in assets may have to comply.Powell was asked repeatedly by Republicans on Capitol Hill last week about the risks of imposing higher capital requirements and how much capital is too much capital. The Fed chair acknowledged that higher requirements trade-off balancing a more stable banking system against the potential for less lending.Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing before Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee at Dirksen Senate Office Building on June 22, 2023 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) (Alex Wong via Getty Images)“Much will depend on getting the specifics right, and we should bear in mind that there are always trade-offs in any financial regulation,” Powell said Thursday. “In addition, the US has benefited from its rich, multi-tiered banking ecosystem, and that diversity should be preserved.”Powell said the banking system is much stronger as a result of the capital requirements and safeguards built around the largest banks since the financial crisis in 2008.Story continues“The events of the past couple of months would have been much more difficult to manage had the largest banks been undercapitalized or illiquid,” he said.Powell’s observations come after the Fed released the results of its annual stress tests on Wednesday. These showed that all 23 US banks required to undergo the test could continue lending to households and businesses during a hypothetical severe recession. They had capital levels equivalent to more than 10% in aggregate, well above the 4.5% buffer the central bank requires.“The bank runs and failures in 2023, however, were painful reminders that we cannot predict all of the stresses that will inevitably come with time and chance,” Powell said Thursday. “We therefore must not grow complacent about the financial system’s resilience.”]"

We should remain humble about how risks can arise and continue our work to ensure that banks are resilient to a range of economic scenarios, market shocks, and other stresses.""Federal Reserve Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr. (AP Photo/Mariam Zuhaib) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Results did vary widely across the industry, however. The bank with the highest capital ratio under the Fed’s “severely adverse scenario” was Charles Schwab (SCHW), one of the lenders that came under a lot of investor scrutiny earlier this year as other banks stumbled.The bank with the lowest ratio was Citizens Financial (CFG), a regional bank based in Rhode Island. Other regional banks such as US Bancorp (USB) and Truist also ended the test with smaller buffers than their giant rivals.But the giants of the industry also posted the biggest projected net income losses under the Fed’s “severely adverse scenario,” led by Citigroup's $34.9 billion. Wells Fargo had $32.9 billion and JPMorgan had $30.1 billion.Story continuesGoldman, perhaps the most storied name on Wall Street, had the highest amount of estimated losses from commercial estate loans and credit cards.It also recorded the highest losses in separate Fed assessments of how the trading books of the biggest banks would perform under “global and exploratory market shocks.”Tougher rulesThe Fed’s test, an annual rite of the industry since the 2008 financial crisis, is the first to be released since turmoil roiled the banking world following the failure of First Republic, Silicon Valley Bank, and Signature Bank this spring.Banks typically use the results of the annual Fed stress tests to determine how much they should have on their balance sheet to absorb shocks and how much they have left over for dividends and buybacks. Some banks are expected to make announcements late Friday about how much money they now plan to return to shareholders.But banks are also bracing for a new set of higher capital requirements from the Fed that will force some of them to hold even greater buffers against losses.These tougher rules were already in the works before the collapse of several regional banks in the spring, but regulators made it clear in the wake of those troubles that they wanted to make sure their new approach applied to mid-sized institutions similar in size to a First Republic or a Silicon Valley Bank. Both had more than $200 billion in assets at the time of their failures.Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said last week he does not expect smaller community banks to be subject to the higher capital requirements, which are expected to be proposed sometime this summer. Institutions with at least $100 billion in assets may have to comply.Forcing banks to amass greater buffers has pros and cons for lenders, regulators, and the economy. It will increase the stability of these institutions, but it will also make it more difficult to earn robust profits and could cause banks to pull back on certain types of lending.Powell discussed this balance last week.“It’s always a trade-off,” he said. “More capital means more stable, resilient banking systems. It can also at the margins mean less credit availability…there is no perfect way to assess that balance.”Barr, the vice chair of supervision, said last week the Fed is also exploring ""reverse stress testing"" that could be used as a tool to make banks more resilient by helping supervisors recognize more exogenous issues that could go wrong instead of patterns from the past regulators have been trained to catch.Meeting a testThe Fed first started applying stress tests to a wide group of banks in 2009 as the last financial crisis was still raging.It was mandated annually by law for institutions with more than $100 billion in assets as part of legislation that passed in 2010. A law passed in 2018 tailored the tests by banks’ size, meaning those in the range of $100 billion-$250 billion would be tested every other year.Democrats and regulators have been critical of that 2018 adjustment, arguing it could have helped prevent the problems that amassed at Silicon Valley Bank, which had not been subjected to a stress test before it failed.Silicon Valley Bank was seized by regulators on March 10. REUTERS/Brittany Hosea-Small (Brittany Hosea-Small / reuters)Some in this year's test — BMO Financial, Citizens, M&amp;T, and RBC US Group — were among the every-other-year banks that weren’t scheduled to be tested again until 2024.But the Fed required BMO, Citizens, and M&amp;T to be tested again in 2023, and RBC also opted in to the 2023 exam. All four banks had capital of 6.4% and higher, above the 4.5% required.This year the Fed examined how 23 banks would fare under a severe global recession that included severe stress in commercial real estate. In such a scenario unemployment spikes to 10%, home prices and commercial real estate plunge about 40%, the stock market plummets 45%, market volatility jumps and corporate bond yields rise.All 23 banks in aggregate would have lost $541 billion. Yet they would still have capital equal to 10.1% of total assets weighted by risk. Well above the 4.5% the Fed requires.The biggest lossesThe $541 billion in total projected losses includes more than $100 billion from commercial real estate and residential mortgages and $120 billion in credit card losses, both higher than the losses projected in last year’s test.The banks with the biggest commercial real estate losses were Goldman, with $16 billion, followed by Morgan Stanley ($13.7 billion) and Citizens ($12.4 billion).Goldman also had the highest credit card losses, with $24.7 billion, followed by Capital One ($22.2 billion) and TD Group ($21.4 billion).Goldman Sachs headquarters, at right. (AP Photo/Mark Lennihan, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Eight banks with large trading operations were also tested against a ""global market shock"" tied to their trading positions. For the first time, this year's test also tested the trading books of those banks against a second ""exploratory market shock.""The Fed said the global market shock was a severe recession with fading inflation expectations; the exploratory market shock tested a less severe recession with greater inflationary pressures.The results from those exams showed that the trading books of the largest banks were resilient amid a rising rate environment.The biggest projected losses belonged to Goldman, with $21.2 billion lost in the global market shock scenario and $18.1 billion in the exploratory market shock component.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

The study achieved its primary endpoint of non-inferiority and superiority in the annualized bleeding rate (“ABR”) of total bleeds post infusion with fidanacogene elaparvovec compared with those study participants who were administered the current standard-of-care (“SOC”) of treatment, i.e., a prophylaxis regimen with Factor IX (“FIX”).Year to date, Pfizer’s shares have lost 28.9% against the industry’s 0.7% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFidanacogene elaparvovec is a one-time gene therapy product consisting of a bio-engineered AAV capsid and a high-activity human coagulation FIX gene. The treatment aims to allow patients to produce FIX themselves without the need to receiving exogenous FIX.Pfizer has in-licensed fidanacogene elaparvovec gene therapy from Spark Therapeutics, a subsidiary of Roche RHHBY. The deal was entered in 2014, five years prior to the acquisition of Spark Therapeutics by Roche in 2019. Per the terms of the licensing deal with the Roche-subsidiary, Pfizer is solely responsible for all pivotal studies and the potential commercialization of fidanacogene elaparvovec.If approved, Pfizer’s gene therapy will face competition from Hemgenix, a one-time gene therapy that was approved by the FDA last November for the treatment of hemophilia B in patients older than 18 years. Hemgenix has been developed by uniQure QURE in partnership with CSL Behring, the latter being a subsidiary of CSL Limited. Following approval, uniQure/CSL’s Hemgenix became the first FDA-approved gene therapy for treating hemophilia B. In February, the treatment also received approval in the EU.Story continuesThe FDA’s approval of uniQure/CSL’s Hemgenix was based on results from the pivotal HOPE-B study, which demonstrated that following the infusion with the gene-therapy, patients produced mean FIX activity of 39% at six months and 36.7% at 24 months. The mean adjusted ABR for all bleeds was also reduced by 54% after seven to 18 months of administering Hemgenix. The clinical development program for Hemgenix was initially led by uniQure, which was subsequently transferred to CSL after it acquired global rights to commercialize the treatment.Other than fidanacogene elaparvovec, Pfizer is developing another gene therapy — giroctocogene fitelparvovec — to treat hemophilia A. The therapy is being developed in collaboration with Sangamo Therapeutics SGMO. Sangamo and Pfizer are evaluating giroctocogene fitelparvovec in the phase III AFFINE study. Pfizer/Sangamo expects to report pivotal data from the AFFINE study by mid-2024. Based on this data, Sangamo/Pfizer expect to start regulatory submissions for the gene therapy candidate in the EU and United States during second-half 2024.Apart from gene therapies, Pfizer is also evaluating marstacimab, an investigational anti-tissue factor pathway inhibitor, to treat hemophilia A and B patients — with and without inhibitors — in the ongoing phase III BASIS study. Last month, Pfizer announced that the BASIS study achieved its primary endpoints. Data from the study showed treatment with marstacimab achieved statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in ABR compared with the current SOC treatment for hemophilia patients, during a 12-month period.A rare genetic blood disorder, hemophilia is caused by a missing clotting protein (FVIII in case of hemophilia A and FIX in case of hemophilia B), which prevents normal blood clotting.

(NASDAQ: PYPL) today announced that Tap to Pay on Android is rolling out for Venmo business profile users in the U.S., enabling them to accept contactless payments directly on their Android mobile devices with no additional hardware or upfront cost.With fewer consumers carrying cash, small businesses are more dependent than ever on the ability to accept card payments. Yet, many small business owners are not set up to cater to this new normal in consumer behavior. Nearly 80 percent of buyers have used contactless payments to complete a purchase, but until now, small businesses have needed to pay for and manage card readers to meet this consumer expectation. That is all set to change with the advent of Tap to Pay technology.With Tap to Pay through Venmo, small businesses in the U.S. will be able to start accepting contactless cards and digital wallets within minutes, directly on their mobile devices with no upfront cost or additional hardware. Venmo business profile users will also be able to manage both their Venmo and card payment transactions directly within the Venmo app, and have all their funds settle into their Venmo account, helping to streamline operations and manage cash flow.""Tap to Pay is the last milestone in the democratization of in-person card payments, where users can start taking card payments with no setup cost in a matter of minutes,"" said Ed Hallett, Head of Product, Microbusiness, PayPal.

The IBM quantum computer, intended to be operational by January of 2024, will serve as the foundation of a new IBM Quantum Computational Center in partnership with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). By partnering, RPI's vision is to greatly enhance the educational experiences and research capabilities of students and researchers at RPI and other institutions, propel the Capital Region into a top location for talent, and accelerate New York's growth as a technology epicenter.RPI's advance into research of applications for quantum computing will represent a more than $150 million investment once fully realized, aided by philanthropic support from Curtis R. Priem '82, vice chair of RPI's Board of Trustees. The new quantum computer will be part of RPI's new Curtis Priem Quantum Constellation, a faculty endowed center for collaborative research, which will prioritize the hiring of additional faculty leaders who will leverage the quantum computing system.""We are grateful for Curtis Priem's support. RPI is building upon our longstanding collaboration with IBM to harness state-of-the-art computing to find solutions to global challenges, while training the next-gen workforce in quantum,"" said Marty A. Schmidt '81, Ph.D., President of RPI. ""Our new quantum computational center will benefit the Capital Region and the State of New York by dramatically enhancing our area's research capabilities. We look forward to working with our partners in the region to transform the Hudson River Valley into 'Quantum Valley.'""Story continues""I am extremely excited to support RPI as it moves into this important realm,"" said Priem. ""This investment will keep RPI at the forefront of technology and innovation, as well as lead the country in leveraging this powerful technology for the good of our nation.""Priem co-founded NVIDIA Corp. in 1993. Since its founding, NVIDIA has been a pioneer in accelerated computing. ""Our invention of the GPU in 1999 sparked the growth of the PC gaming market, redefined computer graphics, ignited the era of modern AI, and is fueling the creation of the metaverse. NVIDIA is now a full-stack computing company with data-center-scale offerings that are reshaping industry."" Priem's past support of RPI includes an historic $40 million unrestricted gift that led to the naming of the Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center (EMPAC).Quantum computers harness the laws of quantum mechanics to process information and may solve problems that are too complex for classical supercomputers such as advancements in computational science research, artificial intelligence, and materials. The IBM Quantum System One to be deployed at RPI will be powered by the 127-qubit IBM Quantum Eagle processor, with which the company has recently demonstrated the capability to perform utility-scale calculations. IBM defines utility-scale as the point at which quantum computers could serve as scientific tools to explore a new scale of problems that remain intractable for classical methods. The agreement with IBM includes a commitment to provide an upgrade to the system installed at RPI in 2026.""Today's quantum computers are novel, scientific tools that can be used to model problems that are extremely difficult, and perhaps impossible, for classical systems, signaling that we are now entering a new phase of utility for quantum computing,"" said Darío Gil, Senior Vice President and Director of IBM Research. ""We expect this collaboration to continue to have tremendous impact for the area's growth as a corridor of innovation, from New York City to the Capital Region. We are thrilled to collaborate with RPI as we continue to nurture the global quantum ecosystem of tomorrow.""RPI has a storied history in advanced technology and is already home to one of the most powerful supercomputers in the world, the Artificial Intelligence Multiprocessing Optimized System (AiMOS). AiMOS, at a top peak processing speed of 11.03 petaFLOPS, is currently the most powerful private university-based supercomputer in the United States. The IBM POWER9 CPU and NVIDIA GPU-equipped supercomputer enables users to explore new AI applications.""The Capital Region is a major center of global semiconductor R&amp;D and manufacturing and key to other emerging industries like quantum computing,"" said U.S. Senator Charles Schumer. ""The region is home to one of the most advanced R&amp;D facilities at the Albany Nanotech Complex, where cutting-edge research is happening like IBM's development of the world's smallest semiconductor chip. The region is also home to premier research institutions like RPI, and under the leadership of President Marty Schmidt, RPI is continuing its 200-year legacy as one of the top technological universities. What a great new feather for the region's cap to have the first IBM Quantum System One placed on a university campus! This sets the Capital Region and Upstate New York apart and will be an asset to recruit and retain talent locally, and help train students in high-value careers.""""RPI's quantum computational center will be installed as we begin to celebrate our 200-year history of innovation. From a pedagogical and research standpoint, the potential exists to accelerate breakthroughs that could benefit the New York region and the world,"" said John E. Kelly, '78G, '80Ph.D., D.H.L.

201,421dd0e7-1073-3f55-a4de-891bba0f5b5e,GM,2023-06-29,General Motors Company (GM) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-motors-company-gm-attracting-130012084.html,1687957212,STORY,['GM'],"[General Motors Company (GM) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +12.4%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors Company falls in, has gained 24.9%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.62 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +42.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.2%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.79 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -10.5%. This estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.48 indicates a change of -4.7% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, General Motors Company is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate of $41.7 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +16.6%. The $163.85 billion and $165.96 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +4.5% and +1.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $39.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. EPS of $2.21 for the same period compares with $2.09 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.68 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.38%. The EPS surprise was +34.76%.Over the last four quarters, General Motors Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

In constant currency, sales increased 10%, with strong results in the Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments. Operating income was $222 million in the second quarter compared to $157 million in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating income was $235 million, a 35% increase from $174 million in the year-ago period, and a 36% increase in constant currency. Earnings per share was $0.56 in the second quarter as compared to $0.44 in the year-ago period. Adjusted earnings per share increased 25% to $0.60 compared to $0.48 in the year-ago period. For fiscal year 2023, McCormick reaffirmed its sales outlook and raised its adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share outlook.Chairman and CEO's Remarks Lawrence E. Kurzius, Chairman and CEO, stated, ""We delivered strong second quarter results reflecting sustained demand across our business and the effective execution of our growth strategies. We drove meaningful year-over-year margin expansion in both the Consumer and Flavor Solutions segments underscoring our focus on profit realization. Our year-to-date results, the continued strong demand across our portfolio, and our diligent approach to optimizing our cost structure bolster our confidence in our growth trajectory.""We drove 10% constant currency sales growth in the second quarter with strong underlying business performance in both segments across all regions. Our Consumer segment sales growth reflects continued effective price realization and a sequential improvement in volume performance. Our exceptional performance in Flavor Solutions continued with our ninth consecutive quarter of constant currency double-digit sales growth. Total sales growth was in line with our expectations, notwithstanding a slower recovery in China, and reflects the strength of our broad global portfolio.Story continues""We drove significant improvement in our gross margin performance in the second quarter reflecting the continued recovery of the cost inflation that our pricing lagged last year as well as cost savings from our CCI and GOE programs. Our year-to-date profit realization combined with the actions we continue to have underway give us the confidence to increase our 2023 profit outlook.""As we look ahead to the back half of the year, we will continue to focus on capitalizing on strong demand, optimizing our cost structure, and positioning McCormick to deliver sustainable growth and long-term shareholder value. We have compelling growth plans in place, including building momentum with our new products and heat platform, and are delivering on our commitment to increasing our profit realization. We expect the successful execution of our proven strategies will continue to drive profitable growth in 2023.""I want to recognize McCormick employees around the world as they drive our momentum and success. Our fundamentals remain strong, and we are confident we will continue to not only deliver strong sales growth, but also drive total shareholder return at an industry-leading pace.""Second Quarter 2023 ResultsMcCormick reported 8% sales growth in the second quarter from the year-ago period, or 10% in constant currency. Constant currency sales growth reflected an 11% increase from pricing actions partially offset by a 1% volume and mix decline. Included in the volume decline is a net 1% increase from lapping prior year COVID-related disruption in China, the Kitchen Basics divestiture, and the exit of the Consumer business in Russia. It also includes a 1% volume decline from the Company's strategic decisions to discontinue low margin business.Gross profit margin expanded 310 basis points versus the second quarter of last year. This expansion was driven by pricing actions, favorable product mix, and cost savings led by the Company's Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) and Global Operating Effectiveness (GOE) programs partially offset by cost inflation. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased from the year-ago period driven by an increase in employee incentive compensation expense as well as higher distribution costs partially offset by CCI-led and GOE cost savings.Operating income increased to $222 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $157 million in the second quarter of 2022. Excluding special charges, as well as integration expenses in 2022, adjusted operating income increased 35% to $235 million in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $174 million in the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income increased 36% from the year-ago period driven by the favorable impact of higher sales and gross margin expansion partially offset by higher selling, general, and administrative expenses.Earnings per share was $0.56 in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $0.44 in the year-ago period. Special charges, as well as integration expenses in 2022, lowered earnings per share by $0.04 in both the second quarter of 2023 and 2022. Excluding these impacts, adjusted earnings per share was $0.60 in the second quarter of 2023 compared to $0.48 in the year-ago period. This 25% increase was driven by higher adjusted operating income partially offset by higher interest expense and a higher adjusted effective tax rate.Net cash provided by operating activities through the second quarter of 2023 was $394 million compared to $154 million through the second quarter of 2022. The increase was primarily driven by higher net income and working capital improvements, including lower inventory, as well as lower incentive compensation payments.Fiscal Year 2023 Financial Outlook For fiscal year 2023, McCormick reaffirmed its sales outlook and raised its operating income and adjusted earnings per share outlook, driven by the strength of its year-to-date performance.McCormick's broad and advantaged global flavor portfolio enables the Company to meet the rising demand for flavor around the world. The Company is capitalizing on the growing consumer interests in healthy and flavorful cooking, digital engagement, valuing trusted brands, and purpose-minded practices. This, coupled with the breadth and reach of McCormick's portfolio and its proven strategies, positions the Company to sustainably continue its growth trajectory.McCormick expects strong underlying business performance in 2023 driven by sales growth. The Company also expects a favorable impact to operating income from its GOE program and the lapping of the negative impact of the COVID-related disruptions in China in 2022, partially offset by the Kitchen Basics divestiture and an expected increase in employee incentive compensation expenses given the anticipated improvement in underlying business performance. In addition, the Company expects earnings per share growth will be tempered by higher interest expense and a higher projected effective tax rate compared to 2022. Excluding this interest and tax headwind, McCormick's operating performance growth is expected to be strong. The Company expects minimal impact on net sales, operating income, and earnings per share from currency rates in 2023.In 2023, McCormick expects to grow sales by 5% to 7% compared to 2022. The Company expects sales growth to be driven primarily by pricing actions which, in conjunction with cost savings, are expected to offset inflationary pressures. McCormick also expects to drive continued growth through the strength of its brands, as well as brand marketing, new products, category management, and differentiated customer engagement plans.Operating income in 2023 is expected to grow by 11% to 13% from $864 million in 2022. The Company anticipates approximately $55 million of special charges in 2023 that relate to previously announced organizational and streamlining actions. Excluding the impact of special charges and integration expenses in 2023 and 2022, adjusted operating income is expected to increase 10% to 12%. The Company previously expected adjusted operating income to increase 9% to 11%.McCormick projects 2023 earnings per share to be in the range of $2.44 to $2.49, compared to $2.52 of earnings per share in 2022. The Company expects special charges to lower earnings per share by $0.16 in 2023. Excluding special charges, the Company projects 2023 adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $2.60 to $2.65, as compared to previously reported guidance of $2.56 to $2.61 and adjusted earnings per share of $2.53 in 2022. The year-over-year expected increase of 3% to 5% reflects strong operating performance, partially offset by an 8% headwind from higher interest expense due to the higher interest-rate environment and lapping the impact of an optimization of the Company's debt portfolio last year, as well as a 1% headwind from an anticipated increase in the Company's projected adjusted effective tax rate.

Included in the volume decline is a net 1% increase from lapping prior year COVID-related disruption in China, the Kitchen Basics divestiture, and the exit of the Consumer business in Russia. It also includes a 1% volume decline from the Company's strategic decisions to discontinue low margin business.Consumer sales in the Americas increased 3% from the second quarter of 2023, or 4% in constant currency. The increase was driven by pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix, including a 1% decline from the Kitchen Basics divestiture and 2% decline related to the discontinuation of business to drive margin improvement.Consumer sales in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) increased 7% compared to the year-ago period. In constant currency, sales grew 9% driven by pricing actions partially offset by lower volume and product mix. The sales increase included a 2% unfavorable impact from lower sales in Russia.Consumer sales in the Asia/Pacific region increased 19% compared to the year-ago period. In constant currency, 28% sales growth included a 20% volume benefit in China due to lapping prior year COVID-related disruption, a 6% increase from pricing actions and 2% increase in all other volume and product mix.Consumer segment operating income, excluding transaction and integration expenses, as well as special charges, increased 23% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the year-ago period.

Flavor Solutions segment sales growth was strong across all regions.In the Americas, Flavor Solutions sales rose 12% compared to the second quarter of 2022.

In constant currency, 22% sales growth included a 13% volume benefit in China due lapping prior year COVID-related disruption, an 8% increase from pricing actions and 1% increase in all other volume and product mix.Flavor Solutions segment operating income, excluding transaction and integration expenses, as well as special charges, grew 66% in the second quarter of 2023 compared to the year-ago period, with minimal impact from currency. Pricing actions, favorable product mix, and  cost savings more than offset the impact of higher cost inflation and distribution costs as well as an increase in employee incentive compensation.Non-GAAP Financial Measures The tables below include financial measures of adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted income tax expense, adjusted income tax rate, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These represent non-GAAP financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These financial measures exclude the impact, as applicable, of the following:Special charges – In our consolidated income statement, we include a separate line item captioned ""Special charges"" in arriving at our consolidated operating income. Special charges consist of expenses and income associated with certain actions undertaken by the Company to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/structural impact to require advance approval by our Management Committee. Expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an on-going basis through completion.Transaction and integration expenses – We exclude certain costs associated with our acquisitions and their subsequent integration into the Company. Such costs, which we refer to as ""Transaction and integration expenses"", include transaction costs associated with each acquisition, as well as integration costs following the respective acquisition, including the impact of the acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventories.Gain on sale of Kitchen Basics - We exclude the gain realized upon our sale of the Kitchen Basics business in August 2022. As more fully described in note 17 in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended November 30, 2022, the pre-tax gain associated with the sale was $49.6 million and is included in Other income, net in our consolidated income statement for the year ended November 30, 2022.We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are important. The exclusion of the items noted above provides additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and, accordingly, facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends.These non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results. In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner that we do. We intend to continue to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the related GAAP financial measures is provided below:(in millions except per share data)Three Months EndedSix Months Ended5/31/20235/31/20225/31/20235/31/2022Operating income$  221.8$ 157.2$ 420.8$ 364.1Impact of transaction and integration expenses—1.5—2.2Impact of special charges13.215.141.034.6Adjusted operating income$  235.0$ 173.8$ 461.8$ 400.9% increase versus year-ago period35.2 %15.2 %Adjusted operating income margin (1)14.2 %11.3 %14.3 %13.1 %Income tax expense$    40.3$   21.7$   74.7$   56.1Impact of transaction and integration expenses—0.4—0.6Impact of special charges3.25.19.710.0Adjusted income tax expense$    43.5$   27.2$   84.4$   66.7Adjusted income tax rate (2)22.3 %18.6 %22.1 %19.2 %Net income$  152.1$ 118.5$ 291.2$ 273.4Impact of transaction and integration expenses—1.1—1.6Impact of special charges10.010.031.324.6Adjusted net income$  162.1$ 129.6$ 322.5$ 299.6% increase versus year-ago period25.1 %7.6 %Earnings per share - diluted$    0.56$   0.44$   1.08$   1.01Impact of transaction and integration expenses———0.01Impact of special charges0.040.040.120.09Adjusted earnings per share - diluted$    0.60$   0.48$   1.20$   1.11% increase versus year-ago period25.0 %8.1 %(1)Adjusted operating income margin is calculated as adjusted operating income as a percentage of net sales for each period presented.(2)Adjusted income tax rate is calculated as adjusted income tax expense as a percentage of income from consolidated operations before income taxes excluding transaction and integration expenses and special charges of $195.3 million and $382.6 million for the three and six months ended May 31, 2023, respectively, $146.4 million and $346.6 million for the three and six months ended May 31, 2022.Because we are a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported U.S. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed ""on a constant currency basis"", is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results).Percentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the corresponding period of the comparative year, rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current fiscal period and the corresponding period of the comparative year.

To estimate the percentage change in adjusted earnings per share on a constant currency basis, a similar calculation is performed to arrive at adjusted net income divided by historical shares outstanding for fiscal year 2022 or projected shares outstanding for fiscal year 2023, as appropriate.The following provides a reconciliation of our estimated earnings per share to adjusted earnings per share for 2023 and actual results for 2022:Twelve Months Ended2023 Projection11/30/22Earnings per share - diluted$2.44 to $2.49$                      2.52Impact of transaction and integration expenses—0.01Impact of special charges0.160.14Impact of after-tax gain on sale of Kitchen Basics—(0.14)Adjusted earnings per share - diluted$2.60 to $2.65$                      2.53Live WebcastAs previously announced, McCormick will hold a conference call with analysts today at 8:00 a.m. ET.

(NASDAQ:UAL) has established itself as a leading player in the airline sector with a range of additional services, including loyalty programs, credit cards, airport lounges and travel insurance.The company has strongly rebounded from the pandemic downturn with record revenue in recent quarters. Despite its strong financial performance and optimistic outlook, United Airlines' stock still trades below pre-2020 values. This presents a compelling opportunity for investors.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with UAL. Click here to check it out. UAL 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of UALPeter Lynch Chart of UALPositive outlook amid industry recoveryUnited Airlines recorded a strong first-quarter performance despite struggling with increased fuel and labor costs due to inflation, as well as the cancellation of flights. Although the number of passengers was still below pre-pandemic levels, international arrivals surged to 80% of pre-pandemic levels in the first quarter of 2023, according to UNWTO World Tourism. During this period, approximately 235 million tourists traveled internationally, more than double the figures recorded in the same period of 2022. These numbers reflect a significant recovery, with two-thirds of pre-pandemic tourist volumes restored last year. Additionally, as per IATA data, U.S. airlines domestic demand climbed 5.5% in April and was 3.3% above 2019 levels.Not every airline company will benefit from these positive market dynamics. To understand whether United Airlines is a big winner in improving macroeconomic conditions for the airline industry, investors need to evaluate a few financial performance metrics.United Airlines total operating revenue increased by an impressive 51.1% year-over-year in the first quarter with total revenue per available seat mile increasing 22.5% year over year, indicating effective revenue management strategies and improved pricing power. These recent results suggest the company is making the most of the strong demand for air travel in the post-pandemic era.Story continuesIn April, the company announced the largest South Pacific network expansion ever, introducing new non-stop flights and increasing its capacity to and from the continental U.S. This strategic move positions the company to capture the growing demand for travel between the U.S. and Australia and New Zealand, presenting significant revenue opportunities in the coming years. United Airlines also unveiled the United Airlines Ventures Sustainable Flight FundSM, a unique investment vehicle aimed at supporting startups focused on decarbonizing air travel.As the industry sets its sights on the upcoming summer season, United Airlines is preparing for a busy period of operations. Surprisingly, travel demand shows no sign of faltering despite concerns over peaking inflation. The International Air Transport Associations passenger polling data from May further supports the optimistic outlook, with 41% of travelers expressing their intention to travel more in the next 12 months compared to the previous year. Additionally, 49% anticipate maintaining the same level of travel activity. With a robust schedule in place, United expects its capacity to reflect the heightened demand during the peak summer months. Notably, the company has increased its scheduled capacity by an impressive 39% in the Atlantic region, while the broader industry, excluding United, estimates a slight decrease of approximately 1%. Across the Pacific excluding China, United foresees a 14% increase in capacity, despite the industry facing a decline of around 7% compared to 2019 levels underlining United's expanding presence and connectivity in key international markets.In terms of overall capacity, United Airlines expects international available seat miles to account for 46% of its total capacity this summer, a slight increase from the 43% recorded in 2019. This projection indicates the airline's strategic focus on international routes and its optimism regarding the recovery of global travel. With these proactive measures, the airline seems to be well-prepared to seize the opportunities presented by the anticipated surge in summer travel.There is also an encouraging sign of recovery in corporate business travel. The company has observed a notable rebound in corporate business, particularly in global long-haul markets, where face-to-face meetings are replacing videoconferencing. While it is still early, the airline is optimistic about the trajectory of corporate demand, with May and June showing promising growth compared to previous months. This resurgence in business traffic is a positive indicator of the recovery of the corporate travel segment. The recent banking crisis temporarily impacted demand across various customer types - its effects were more pronounced in domestic business travel - while domestic leisure and overall international demand were relatively less affected. In the weeks following the crisis, there was an eight-point decline in business demand compared to the same period in 2019. However, this trend has since reversed, indicating a gradual restoration of confidence among corporate travelers.Looking ahead to the second quarter, United Airlines expects significant growth in total revenue, with a projected increase of 14% to 16% compared to the same quarter in 2022. The airline's outlook remains strong, with expected growth rates of around 8% to 10% for domestic revenue and nearly 30% for international revenue. These positive projections align with the current booking trends, which show a 13% increase in booked deals and 31% growth compared to 2019.IATA has also updated its 2023 profit forecast for the aviation industry. With strong travel demand and a favorable decline in oil prices, the industry's profit forecast has been raised to $9.8 billion, up from the previous estimate of $4.7 billion. One encouraging sign is the expected growth in revenue to $803 billion. This represents a 9.7% increase compared to the previous year, pushing the industry closer to its pre-pandemic level of $838 billion in 2019. Passenger revenues are projected to contribute significantly to this growth, with an estimated $546 billion this year, reflecting a 27% growth from 2022. Efficiency levels within the industry are commendable, with an expected average passenger load factor of 80.9%. This nears the record performance achieved in 2019, with an 82.6% load factor. The high demand for travel across many markets contributes to robust yields, which are expected to experience a marginal decline of 1.1% compared to the previous year.The pressure from oil prices has eased this year, providing some relief to the industry. Fuel costs, a major expenditure for airlines, are expected to average $98.5 per barrel, resulting in a total fuel bill of $215 billion. Although cheaper than initially expected, fuel costs will still account for 28% of the average cost structure, above the pre-pandemic level of 24% in 2019.Although revenue growth is promising, airlines still face challenges in maintaining profitability. However, with strong demand and operational efficiency, margins are anticipated to recover in the near future. Consequently, industry leaders, including United Airlines, are expected to regain their momentum. Analysts are already upgrading their price targets in response to this positive outlook. Despite the uncertainties and risks associated with the airline industry, United's financial results, network expansions and operational achievements showcase its ability to navigate the evolving landscape successfully. The company's strong liquidity position, with approximately $19 billion in liquidity at the end of the first quarter, provides a solid foundation for future growth and investment opportunities.TakeawayUnited Airlines has emerged as a formidable industry leader, successfully rebounding from the challenges posed by the pandemic. With near-record revenue numbers and a stock price that remains below its pre-pandemic levels, the stock seems attractively priced today. The aviation industry's outlook for 2023 appears positive and the anticipation of improved margins and clearer macroeconomic conditions further strengthens the case for investing in industry leaders.By closely monitoring the capital-intensive industry dynamics and macroeconomic conditions, investors can capitalize on the undervalued potential of United Airlines.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

It is seeking to put in place a new set of higher capital requirements, known as Basel 3, that will force some to hold greater buffers against losses.These tougher rules were already in the works before the collapse of several regional US banks in the spring. In the wake of those troubles, regulators made it clear that they wanted to make sure their new approach applied to institutions similar in size to First Republic or a Silicon Valley Bank. Both had more than $200 billion in assets at the time of their failures.Powell said last week he does not expect smaller community banks to be subject to the higher capital requirements, which are expected to be proposed sometime this summer. Institutions with at least $100 billion in assets may have to comply.Powell was asked repeatedly by Republicans on Capitol Hill last week about the risks of imposing higher capital requirements and how much capital is too much capital. The Fed chair acknowledged that higher requirements trade-off balancing a more stable banking system against the potential for less lending.Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing before Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee at Dirksen Senate Office Building on June 22, 2023 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) (Alex Wong via Getty Images)“Much will depend on getting the specifics right, and we should bear in mind that there are always trade-offs in any financial regulation,” Powell said Thursday. “In addition, the US has benefited from its rich, multi-tiered banking ecosystem, and that diversity should be preserved.”Powell said the banking system is much stronger as a result of the capital requirements and safeguards built around the largest banks since the financial crisis in 2008.Story continues“The events of the past couple of months would have been much more difficult to manage had the largest banks been undercapitalized or illiquid,” he said.Powell’s observations come after the Fed released the results of its annual stress tests on Wednesday. These showed that all 23 US banks required to undergo the test could continue lending to households and businesses during a hypothetical severe recession. They had capital levels equivalent to more than 10% in aggregate, well above the 4.5% buffer the central bank requires.“The bank runs and failures in 2023, however, were painful reminders that we cannot predict all of the stresses that will inevitably come with time and chance,” Powell said Thursday. “We therefore must not grow complacent about the financial system’s resilience.”]"

Individuals are now prioritizing essential items over larger purchases like furniture and apparel.When evaluating the safety of Target’s dividend, it is important to acknowledge the company’s extensive track record of consistently raising dividends over time.However, its free cash flow yield hit a five-year low in January 2023.

However, the inflated valuation proved unsustainable as rising rates took a toll on speculative growth stocks.DigitalOcean provides cloud infrastructure platform services tailored to meet the needs of small and medium-sized businesses. While larger competitors like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud dominate the cloud infrastructure market, DigitalOcean focuses on serving SMBs with smaller-scale server services known as “droplets.”Detractors point out two significant challenges in DigitalOcean’s business model. First, larger cloud platforms have been encroaching into the SMB market, offering more affordable and scaled-down services.The company acknowledges that these larger competitors possess “substantial competitive advantages.”Secondly, profitability in the cloud infrastructure market requires substantial scale. Among the industry leaders, only AWS consistently generates profits.Although DigitalOcean’s revenue growth is comparable to its larger counterparts, the company has yet to achieve profitability based on generally accepted accounting principles.The company, already grappling with challenges such as slower customer acquisition, loss of revenue from the crypto market downturn, and business disruptions in Russia and Ukraine, now faces additional hurdles.Analyst stock downgrades have placed it among the high-risk stocks with downgrades.The latest downgrade comes from Piper Sandler, making it one of Wall Street’s least favorite stocks. As investors seek guidance on stocks to avoid in June, this company’s situation becomes increasingly precarious.Infosys (INFY)The regional office of Infosys (INFY) in Karnataka, India.Source: AjayTvm / Shutterstock.comInfosys (NYSE:INFY) received a downgrade from Susquehanna Financial Group on Wednesday, triggering a dip in the stock price. While Infosys is a prominent tech giant with a powerful brand known for operational excellence, concerns have arisen. These concerns revolve around the erosion of its current competitive advantages due to architectural changes.The analysts at Susquehanna Financial Group, acknowledging Infosys’ global standing, have lowered their estimates further below consensus and shifted their outlook to Negative, setting a $13 price target.Their research shows that several factors are dampening demand. Macro-level conditions are causing delays in discretionary work across the industry, while integrating AI technology is slowing decision-making processes as customers navigate architectural changes.Analysts have heard reports that the widespread availability and open sourcing of AI are exerting pricing pressure on vendors.In this environment, customers seek shared savings, and it remains uncertain which supplier will be the first to reduce prices. In-sourcing could become a viable alternative if no significant price reductions occur.While there is always a chance for progress in forming large deals beyond the analysts’ estimates, the risk to revenue has led them to adopt a Negative stance with a $13 price target.In summary, it is essential to be cautious when considering Infosys as an investment option. The concerns raised by the analysts contribute to Wall Street’s cautious sentiment towards the stock.On the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

222,7498be20-3f3f-3587-b3e3-fb7945688c32,ISRG,2023-06-29,3 Robotics Stocks to Buy With Explosive Upside Potential,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-robotics-stocks-buy-explosive-111500326.html,1687518900.0,STORY,"['PATH', 'ISRG', 'ROK']","[Over the next decade, the robotics industry is likely to have a big impact on economic output and productivity. Be it industrial automation, construction, mobility or healthy, robotics will provide increased efficiency and accuracy. With plenty of growth to come, it’s a good time to look at some of the top robotics stocks to buy.To elaborate on the industry’s potential, the global robotics market was worth $25 billion in 2021. Boston Consulting Group expects the market size to swell to $160 to $260 billion by 2030. Of this, industrial robotics is likely to be worth $60.6 billion.If these estimates hold true, stocks of some of the best robotics companies will be big-time value creators. I expect multi-bagger returns from some of the best robotics stocks over a period of five years.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThis column will discuss three robotics stocks to buy that seem to be best positioned to benefit from these tailwinds.PATHUiPath$16.08ISRGIntuitive Surgical$327.61ROKRockwell Automation$314.98UiPath (PATH)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website homepage of UiPath (PATH).Source: dennizn / Shutterstock.comUiPath (NYSE:PATH) is a provider of robotic process automation solutions. PATH stock looks attractive, after trading sideways over the last 12 months. I expect a big breakout to the upside, as the company delivers strong numbers.For Q1 2024, the company reported revenue of $290 million, which was 18% higher on a year-over-year basis. For the year, the company has guided for revenue of $1.27 billion. I believe that there are two important points to note with these numbers.First, UiPath invested $75.3 billion in research and development for the quarter. The company released its latest platform (2023.4), which leverages the power of AI to discover automation opportunities. Investment in R&amp;D will continue to provide UiPath an edge over its competitors over time.Second, the company reported positive operating cash flow of $67.3 billion for the quarter. With robust revenue growth, it’s likely that operating cash flows will swell over time. This will provide ample headroom for larger investments in innovation, spurring a nice flywheel for the company and investors.Story continuesIntuitive Surgical (ISRG)A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a technology leader in robotic-assisted, minimally invasive surgery. Notably, ISRG stock has surged 72% over the last 12 months. I believe that intermediate corrections would be a good opportunity to accumulate the stock, as this is a long-term holding in the robotics space worth picking up on the cheap.Why?Well, mostly due to the company’s da Vinci surgical system. This system is Intuitive’s most popular product, with 12 million procedures performed on the system to date. For Q1 2023, Intuitive reported revenue of $1.7 billion. An important point to note is that 81% of the revenue was recurring. As the company’s product installed base swells globally, recurring revenue will increase. This provides clear cash flow visibility for investors, something that’s hard to come by in this sector.It’s also worth noting that the company’s da Vinci system installed base stands at 4,668 in the United States. Outside the country, the installed base is 3,111. This fact implies that Intuitive has a strong global presence, something of a diversifier for investors concerned about U.S.-only exposure.With a massive potential addressable market, the recurring revenue potential for the company is huge.Rockwell Automation (ROK)Rockwell Automation sign is seen in Cambridge, On, Canada. ROK stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockRockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) is a company that’s already in a full-on bull market rally, surging more than 20% year-to-date, at the time of writing. I’ve remained bullish on this stock as a long-term play, and that hasn’t changed.As an overview, the company’s products and solutions cater to the manufacturing and mining industry. Their focus is on digital transformation, industry analytics, and industrial automation control. Specific to robotics, the company is partnering with robot makers to deliver control software with the latest robot technology.Rockwell has been delivering healthy growth, and I like the fact that the company has strong global presence. For Q2 2023, the company reported 31.8% year-on-year growth from Asia Pacific. However, the region contributes to only 15% of total sales. With robust growth expected in emerging markets, Rockwell’s revenue outside North America will continue to swell.It’s worth noting that for the first six months of 2023, Rockwell reported free cash flow of $197.7 million. With healthy growth, I expect free cash flows to swell, which will translate into higher dividends for investors over time.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)Aiming to keep up with competitors in road and sea transportation, three major freight railroads announced plans to create a new trade route for shippers connecting Mexico, Texas and the U.S. Southeast.Canadian Pacific Kansas City (CPKC), CSX and Genesee &amp; Wyoming railroads aim to establish a direct CPKC-CSX interchange connection near Myrtlewood, Alabama, providing shippers with rail access to new markets.The deal would also improve CSX’s access to Mexico.“CSX is excited to establish this new interchange connection with CPKC, which provides shippers with a compelling transportation option with access to markets in Texas and Mexico, as well as into the heart of the thriving and dynamic U.S. Southeast,” Joe Hinrichs, CSX president and CEO, said in a news release.As part of the series of the proposed transactions announced Wednesday, CPKC (NYSE: CP) and CSX (NASDAQ: CSX) will each acquire or operate portions of the 168-mile Meridian &amp; Bigbee Railroad (MNBR), a Genesee &amp; Wyoming Inc.-owned railway in Mississippi and Alabama.“This strategic acquisition will bring more shipping options to intermodal, automotive and other customers by providing a new, efficient corridor,” Keith Creel, CPKC president and CEO, said in a statement. “With this new east-west connection taking advantage of each railway’s routes and service, we can extend our reach, converting more freight traffic to rail and off our highways.”Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Portions of the transaction are subject to regulatory review and approval from the U.S. Surface Transportation Board.The MNBR rail line currently runs between Meridian, Mississippi, and Montgomery, Alabama, and is overseen by a combination of ownership and operating agreements.Under the deal proposed Wednesday, CPKC would acquire and operate the segment of the MNBR between Meridian and Myrtlewood, and CSX would operate the lines currently leased by MNBR east of Myrtlewood.Story continuesCPKC and CSX would establish a direct CPKC-CSX interchange at or near Myrtlewood. In exchange, G&amp;W would acquire certain Canadian properties owned by CPKC and other rights.MNBR would receive rights to continue to provide local service to existing customers on former MNBR-owned lines and connect with other railroads without interchange restrictions.“We are pleased to have entered into agreements with CSX and CPKC that will enable MNBR to continue providing customers with outstanding short line service, while enabling our Class I partners to create a new connection into the Southeast U.S.,” Jack Hellmann, CEO of G&amp;W railroad, said in a statement.“At the same time, we have enhanced several agreements related to other G&amp;W short line railroads and are collaborating on the expansion of our service to Alberta, Canada, and the Alberta Industrial Heartland in conjunction with CPKC.”For CPKC, it’s one the latest moves as the railroad bets big on Mexico cross-border freight.CPKC recently expanded its Mexico cross-border capacity with the addition of 1,000 53-foot refrigerated intermodal containers.In April, CPKC announced agreements with Schneider National and Knight-Swift Transportation for intermodal services using the company’s Mexico Midwest Express daily premium single-line intermodal rail service.Rival railroad CN (NYSE: CNI) announced in April a partnership between Union Pacific (NYSE: UNP) and Mexico railway Ferromex to offer a transcontinental intermodal service.CN has also said it is partnering with maritime and logistics services company Crowley to provide integrated rail and ocean service between Mexico and the U.S. Midwest and Canada via the Port of Mobile in Alabama.Watch: Yellow sues Teamsters union for $137 million.Click for more FreightWaves articles by Noi Mahoney.More articles by Noi MahoneyMexico-based mega carrier acquires US logistics firmFlorida tomato growers wants US to terminate Mexico trade dealDemand for global supply chain intelligence continues to riseThe post Railroads move to create more access between Mexico, Texas, US Southeast appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Hilton Grand Vacations HGV, Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, Cinemark CNK and OneSpaWorld OSW.Here are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Big Gainers on Soaring Consumer ConfidenceAmericans, at present, are feeling much more self-assured about their well-being and are unfazed by the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary measures to curb elevated inflation. Their outlook for family finances improved substantially, and a few are apprehensive about an impending recession.This is because the consumer confidence index climbed to 109.7 in June from May’s revised reading of 102.5, and touched the highest level since January 2022, per the Conference Board. Consumers’ assessment of the present business and employment scenario also improved, with the present situation index coming in at 155.3 in June compared with 148.9 in May. The present situation index, in reality, hit the highest level in nearly two years.The expectations index, which indicates how consumers feel about economic conditions in the forthcoming six-month period, increased to 79.3 in June from May’s reading of 71.5, its highest level this year. Moreover, consumers do feel that inflation will slow down soon, compelling the Fed to eventually pause rate hikes, and bolster the economy. Americans expect price pressures to increase by 6% next year, the lowest reading since the end of 2020, citing a MarketWatch article.So, what drove consumer confidence? Household confidence was mainly determined by the current strength in the labor market that ebbed concerns about an economic slump. Hiring accelerated in May, with 339,000 new jobs being added to the economy, per the Labor Department. May’s hiring was robust, and job growth was positive for the 29th consecutive month.Story continuesAt the same time, the jobless rate continues to hover below the coveted 4% mark, signifying that Americans are secure in their jobs. Average hourly earnings too improved by 0.3% in May after gaining 0.4% in April (read more: 5 Stocks to Gain From Stunning Jobs Growth in May).With consumers gaining confidence amid wage growth and a lower unemployment level, household spending is set to improve. And with renewed strength in consumer spending, consumer discretionary companies are set to grow as the outlays play a vital role in shaping their revenues.We have, thus, selected four consumer discretionary stocks that flaunt a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). Such stocks also boast a VGM Score of A or B. Here V stands for Value, G for Growth and M for Momentum, and the score is a weighted combination of these three metrics.

Overstock shares in the green after the company receives approval for the purchase of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond's assets. ZoomInfo shares rise as Needham initiates coverage on the stock. Yahoo Finance Live breaks down some of the trending tickers of the day.Video TranscriptBRAD SMITH: We're 30 minutes into today's trading action and taking a look at the US major averages here. Right now, we are down across the board.The Dow lower by about 4/10 of a percent. That slipped just a little bit lower from when we started off the session. The S&amp;P 500, you're seeing that just sitting at about 3/10 of a percent, 4/10 of a percent in decline on the day. And then the NASDAQ, that is down by about 2/10 of a percent more, round that off to as of right now.Let's take a look at some of the top movers this morning. We're watching chip makers as they take a hit following a report from the Wall Street Journal, saying the US is considering new restrictions on exports of artificial intelligence chips to China. The move is expected to limit the second largest economy's ability to build its AI capabilities, following restrictions in 2022. Those shipments and those halted shipments of the most advanced AI chips made by nVidia and AMD.JULIA HYMAN: We're also watching shares of Overstock. It's getting a little boost. On the news, a judge has approved the e-commerce company's 21 and 1/2 million-dollar purchase of Bed, Bath &amp; Beyond's assets, in particular not the physical stores, but rather the defunct retailer's brand name, its intellectual property, and its online platform, not, though, those retail locations or the Buy Buy Baby brand. A US bankruptcy court judge saying in the hearing he was gratified that the winning bidder would keep the brand alive. I guess the judge is a fan of those 20% coupons.BRAD SMITH: Probably got some in the drawer, like many of us. And lastly, we are watching Zoom info this morning. The stock is rising as Needham initiates coverage with a buy rating and a $35 price target, a boon for a stock that doesn't get too much attention on the day-in, day-out basis. But take a look at shares here on the day, they're up by a little more than 5% on that from Needham.]"

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Visa (NYSE:V), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. Check out our latest analysis for Visa Visa's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf you believe that markets are even vaguely efficient, then over the long term you'd expect a company's share price to follow its earnings per share (EPS) outcomes. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years Visa grew its EPS by 11% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. While we note Visa achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 15% to US$31b. That's encouraging news for the company!You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyFortunately, we've got access to analyst forecasts of Visa's future profits. You can do your own forecasts without looking, or you can take a peek at what the professionals are predicting.Are Visa Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Visa, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. We note that their impressive stake in the company is worth US$234m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.05% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.Story continuesDoes Visa Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?One positive for Visa is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 1 warning sign for Visa that you need to be mindful of.Although Visa certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

At the same time, while home shoppers had more homes to choose from this month, improvement stalled as the active inventory growth rate slowed for the fourth month in a row (+7.1%) and came in well below May's +21.5% rate.""While home asking prices grew seasonally, price gains have been weakening since last summer as rising mortgage rates have added to ongoing affordability challenges and further cooled buyer demand, so the first year-over-year decline in median list prices this month wasn't unexpected. While this could feel like a welcome relief for buyers, our revised 2023 outlook expects only a modest drop in home prices of 0.6% for the year. This may not be enough to noticeably bring down costs until the end of the year as inflation and rates start to fall too,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""Fewer potential sellers opting to list their home because of the mortgage rate lock-in effect continues to be a drag on the market. Fortunately, for those willing to make a move, falling prices won't erase the substantial price gains seen the past few years, and most will likely have enough equity to come out ahead.""What it means for homebuyers, sellers, and the housing marketAffordability has evolved into an increasingly important factor in home purchase decisions, and a drop in home listing prices creates potential opportunities for buyers, especially with some creativity.""If buyers see homes sitting on the market for a while that haven't received many good offers, there may be some opportunities for further negotiations. It never hurts to ask a seller if they would be willing to reduce their price a little, contribute to closing costs, or even buy down their mortgage rate,"" said Realtor.com® Executive News Editor Clare Trapasso. ""While this likely won't work for the well-located, move-in ready homes oozing curb appeal, buyers may want to take another look at homes that may need a little work. Sometimes a coat of paint and minor work can make a big difference.""Story continuesJune 2023 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over June 2022Change over June 2019Median listing price-0.9% (to $445,000)+39.1 %Active listings+7.1 %-49.7 %New listings-25.7 %-28.8 %Median days on market+13 days (to 44 days)-10 daysShare of active listings with price reductions+-0.7 percentage points (to 14.1%)-2.9 percentage pointsHome asking prices see first annual decline as high borrowing costs create barriersRecent near-record high mortgage rates and still-high listing prices continue to create affordability challenges for homebuyers, which is putting downward pressure on home list prices, which slipped annually in June for the first time since 2017. Despite high borrowing costs and a low inventory of homes to choose from in the market, homebuying sentiment continues to improve in recent months, and a new survey from Realtor.com® and Censuswide found that the vast majority of respondents, nearly 9 in 10 of those shopping, still hope to make a home purchase happen this year.In June, the U.S. median list price grew to $445,000, up from $441,000 in May but down slightly (-0.9%) from June 2022's record high of $449,000.Northeastern metros had the highest growth rate in active listing prices, with an average increase of 11.7% over the past year. Prices in Cincinnati, Ohio (+20.0%), Rochester, N.Y. (+19.6%), and Los Angeles (+17.7%) saw the biggest increases among large metros. However, in each of these metros the mix of inventory changed and larger, more expensive homes were listed for sale in June compared to the previous year.Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, 15 out of the largest 50 markets saw their median list price decline. The greatest price declines were seen in Texas metros: Austin (-6.8% year over year), Houston (-5.1%), and Raleigh, N.C. (-4.2%).Nationally, the share of homes with price reductions was mostly flat in June, decreasing slightly from 14.7% last June to 14.1% this year.Among the largest metros, the largest increases in the percentage of homes with price reductions compared to last year were in San Antonio, Texas (+8.3 percentage points), Memphis, Tenn. (+6.3 pp) and Jacksonville, Fla. (+4.7 pp).Buyers short on options as active inventory declines in many areasThere continues to be an ongoing lack of homes for sale as potential sellers with near-record equity take a wait-and-see approach and buyers compete over the remaining available homes for sale. In June, the growth in the number of active homes for sale slowed for the fourth month in a row, and growth stalled completely in the final week of June, with the number of active homes for sale slipping below (-0.3%) year ago levels for the first time in a year (59 weeks). New listings to the market have been scarce this year too – the pace of new listings year-to-date is even lower (-16.4%) than in the first half of 2020, when the real estate market was still contending with pandemic-era closures, restrictions, and uncertainties – highlighting just how short on options buyers are in today's market.Nationally, active inventory grew 7.1% year over year in June, but slowed for the fourth month in a row, registering less than half of May's 21.5% rate. On average, active inventory in June was 50.6% below pre-pandemic 2017–2019 levels.Both pending listings (-16.7%), or homes under contract, and newly listed homes (-25.7%) declined year over year. The number of homes newly-listed for sale declined at a faster rate in June than May's 22.7% decrease.Among the 50 largest metros, inventory growth is being driven almost exclusively by the South, which saw the most growth (+24.1%) in homes for sale compared to last June, led by San Antonio (+65.7%), Nashville, Tenn. (63.3%) and New Orleans (60.0%). All other regions saw declining annual growth in active inventory in June.Active inventory decreased in 28 out of 50 of the largest metros compared to last year. Western markets reported the largest yearly declines, with the top three in California metros: San Jose, (-44.1%), San Diego (-35.9%), and Sacramento (-33.4%).In June, none of the 50 largest metro areas saw new listings increase over last year.Homes continue to linger longer on the market, giving buyers more time to searchDespite a significant slowing from the frenzied pace of the past couple years, in most areas of the country, the housing market continues to move quicker than it did in the pre-pandemic era, with homes today selling more than a week faster on average than in pre-pandemic June 2017-2019.The typical home spent 43 days on market in June, 14 days longer than this time last year, but 10 fewer days than they typically did in the average June 2017–2019.Across the 50 largest U.S. metros, in June the typical home spent 44 days on the market, 13 days more than the previous June. This trend was seen across all regions, with larger metros in the South seeing the greatest increase (+15 days), followed by the West (+9 days), Northeast (+7 days) and Midwest (+6 days). Homes in Western metros were also spending one more day on the market than pre-pandemic times, but in all other regions homes were still selling more quickly.All of the 50 largest metros saw an increase in time on market compared to the previous year. Time on market increased the most in Raleigh, N.C. (+26 days), Austin, Texas (+25 days), and Miami (+25 days).June 2023 Housing Overview by Top 50 Largest Metros Metro AreaMedian Listing PriceMedian Listing Price YoYMedian Listing Price per Sq. Ft.

These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Bonita Springs include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity as well as C-band spectrum designed for fast speeds, high capacity and wide coverage. With the recent deployments and upgrades, more people in Bonita Springs now have access to 5G service from Verizon. Verizon Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using its C-band spectrum designed for high capacity and wide coverage. Most notably, Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband service has recently expanded to areas near Bonita Beach, the Bonita Bay area, near Leisure Time Park, the Lighthouse Bay at the Brooks area and around Bonita Beach Road and US Highway 41.Bonita Springs’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum.  Verizon engineers are using 100 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Bonita Springs will be able to take advantage of nearly twice that amount of spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband.  That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Bonita Springs. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network.  Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Bonita Springs area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data. Story continues“We know customers count on us, and we work everyday to ensure we deliver for them.

VZ is revolutionizing the way business enterprises manage their fixed wireless connections with a range of new features and native security offerings. The telecom giant is introducing a cloud-based router management dashboard, coupled with advanced security features, to empower businesses of all sizes to address their performance, security and visibility needs from a centralized location.In a move to cater to the diverse requirements of businesses, Verizon is offering these solutions as simple-to-add enhancements to its fixed-wireless plans, eliminating the need for special equipment or in-house IT support. This means that businesses can take advantage of the new features without any installation hassles, enabling them to focus on their core operations.Key among the offerings is the Verizon Business Internet Portal, accessible via verizon.com. The portal allows businesses to monitor and self-manage their entire portfolio of fixed-wireless connections, irrespective of the router manufacturer. It provides critical network-management capabilities such as performance monitoring, diagnostics, device management and bulk configuration management for enterprises with multiple lines.The remote accessibility of the portal is particularly advantageous for businesses with hybrid or highly distributed work environments. It allows organizations to manage equipment across physical locations and remote work setups, ensuring seamless connectivity and efficient operations.Verizon is also introducing two tiers of its Verizon Business Internet Security (VBIS) service, available as paid enhancements to LTE or 5G Business Internet plans. VBIS offers network-native security features, including ransomware protection, phishing prevention, malware defense, malicious website blocking and more. These security services can be activated immediately, requiring no additional installation and are easily managed through the Verizon Business Internet Portal.The integration of security services at the Internet gateway protects devices from accessing malicious content or visiting harmful websites, bolstering the overall cybersecurity of businesses. The portal provides insightful logs and reports on blocked threats, offering businesses visibility into their security defenses.These enhancements by Verizon Business come at a time when fixed wireless access (FWA) connections are projected to grow rapidly, with multi-location businesses driving the demand. By offering a cloud-based management portal and network-native security, Verizon ensures that businesses can easily monitor and configure their FWA connectivity, regardless of their IT infrastructure size. This streamlined approach not only improves flexibility and scalability but also reinforces the value proposition of FWA for businesses across sectors.Verizon's initiative aligns with the growing cybersecurity concerns faced by businesses of all sizes. With the rising costs of cyberattacks, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, VBIS provides a comprehensive solution that simplifies cybersecurity setup and reduces vulnerabilities. Such coveted service offerings are likely to strengthen its leading market position and augment its long-term revenues.The stock has lost 28.3% over the past year compared with the industry’s decline of 18.7%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchVerizon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Key PicksInterDigital, Inc.

254,9acda4fc-d439-38c0-b03c-af6b4fd52cae,NVDA,2023-06-29,Is NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) A Risky Investment?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-nasdaq-nvda-risky-investment-110047721.html,1688036447,STORY,['NVDA'],"[Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?When Is Debt A Problem?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for NVIDIA What Is NVIDIA's Net Debt?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that NVIDIA had US$11.0b in debt in April 2023; about the same as the year before. But on the other hand it also has US$15.3b in cash, leading to a US$4.37b net cash position.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Strong Is NVIDIA's Balance Sheet?According to the last reported balance sheet, NVIDIA had liabilities of US$7.26b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$12.7b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$15.3b as well as receivables valued at US$4.08b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$540.0m.Story continuesThis state of affairs indicates that NVIDIA's balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the US$1.02t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. While it does have liabilities worth noting, NVIDIA also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.The modesty of its debt load may become crucial for NVIDIA if management cannot prevent a repeat of the 60% cut to EBIT over the last year. When a company sees its earnings tank, it can sometimes find its relationships with its lenders turn sour. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if NVIDIA can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. While NVIDIA has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, NVIDIA recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 86% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Summing UpWhile it is always sensible to look at a company's total liabilities, it is very reassuring that NVIDIA has US$4.37b in net cash. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$5.1b, being 86% of its EBIT. So we don't have any problem with NVIDIA's use of debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for NVIDIA   you should know about.When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

The company is benefiting from growing demand for embedded technologies across the automotive and industrial markets. Moreover, solid rebound in the automotive market remains a positive.Further, strengthening demand environment in the industrial, communication equipment and enterprise systems markets is a tailwind. Notably, solid investments in new growth avenues and competitive advantages remain tailwinds. Further, its portfolio of long-lived products and efficient manufacturing strategies are other positives.However, pandemic-led supply-chain disruptions and imposition of new export regulations are headwinds. Further, weakness in Analog segment of the company is a concern.

The company maintains momentum on asthma drug Dupixent’s stellar performance, driven by continued strong demand in the approved indications.Growth in Dupixent through additional label expansions and a promising late-stage pipeline set the momentum for further development. The approval of Libtayo for additional indications is likely to drive the drug’s sales and diversify the company’s portfolio. Regeneron has a deep pipeline and the development of additional drugs will be an incremental boost to the company.However, lead drug Eylea sales are under pressure due to increasing competition. A decline in Eylea sales will hurt Regeneron's performance.

The company is witnessing growing demand for memory chips from cloud-computing providers and acceleration in 5G (fifth-generation) cellular network adoptions.Rising mix of high-value solutions, enhancement in customer engagement and improvement in cost structure are growth drivers as well. Additionally, 5G adoption in Internet of Things devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for memory and storage.However, Micron Technology near-term prospect looks gloomy as weakening consumer spending is negatively impacting demand for memory chips used in personal computers (PCs) and smartphones.

(AP) — Attorneys for Gov. Ron DeSantis have asked that a trial involving Disney be postponed until the middle of 2025, well after the GOP presidential nomination race wraps up and voters have picked a winner in the November 2024 general election.In a Tallahassee federal court filing Tuesday, attorneys for the Florida governor, who is seeking the Republican nomination, and his appointees to a board that governs Disney World outlined a proposed schedule that requests an Aug. 4, 2025, trial date.Disney claims in its lawsuit that its free speech rights were violated by the takeover of its governing district in retaliation for opposing the so-called Don’t Say Gay legislation DeSantis championed. In the same filing, Disney proposed a July 15, 2024, trial date, which is around the same time as the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee.Both sides also disagreed about when a motion should be filed asking the judge to make a decision in favor of one side without a full trial. Disney proposed filing its motion for summary judgment at the start of April 2024, while DeSantis' attorneys said it should be exactly a year later, at the start of April 2025.Earlier this week, DeSantis and his appointees to the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District asked the judge to dismiss the lawsuit, put it on hold or drop them as defendants.The DeSantis appointees took over the Disney World governing board earlier this year following a yearlong feud between the company and DeSantis. The fight began last year after Disney, beset by significant pressure internally and externally, publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades, a policy critics call Don’t Say Gay.As punishment, DeSantis took over the district through legislation passed by the Republican-led Legislature and appointed a new board of supervisors to oversee municipal services for the sprawling theme parks and hotels. But before the new board came in, the company made agreements with previous oversight board members who were Disney supporters that stripped the new supervisors of their authority over design and construction.Story continuesIn response, DeSantis and Florida lawmakers passed legislation that repealed those agreements.Disney sued DeSantis and the five-member board, asking a federal judge to void the governor’s takeover of the theme park district, as well as the new oversight board’s actions, on the grounds that they violated the company’s free speech rights.The board sued Disney in state court in an effort to maintain its control of construction and design at Disney World.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the history of sports, the world’s #1 sport, the hardest sport in Asia, sports sponsorships and endorsements, disruptions and innovations in the sports market, the future of ESPN and the future outlook of sports streaming, and go directly to 5 Hardest Sports in the World Ranked. While the majority of sports played today have been created/developed in the 19th and 20th centuries, our ancestors started competing against each other in primitive sports as a means of pastime and entertainment in ancient times. In the beginning, sports often involved training for war or training as a hunter, which explains why so many early games involved the throwing of spears, stakes, and rocks, and sparring one-on-one with opponents. As time went on, sporting competitions became more organized and the best example of this revolution in organized sports occurred in ancient Greece, where the first Olympic games took place in 760 BC. Though sports are an excellent source of entertainment for their viewers worldwide, many of them are a dangerous affair for the athletes involved. For this reason, we have compiled a List of the Hardest Sports in the World. World’s No. 1 Sport:Soccer is the No. 1 sport in the world, in terms of popularity, with around 3.5 billion fans worldwide and players in almost every country of the world. The Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) is currently made up of 205 member associations, with over 300,000 clubs and 240 million registered players. FIFA functions as a non-profit organization and most of its revenue is derived from TV broadcasting rights, advertisements for the World Cup, and the sale of licensing rights. FIFA reported a revenue of $7.568 billion for the 2019-22 period, representing a cycle-on-cycle increase of 18%, compared to $6.421 billion for the 2015-18 period. An estimated 1.5 billion people around the world watched the pulsating Final between Argentina and France, while another 88,966 spectators were packed inside the Lusail Stadium. Story continuesSoccer is also one of the toughest sports in the world, hence it is included in our ranking of hardest sports in the world. Another sport becoming increasingly popular in the U.S. is pickleball. If you wish to read more about it, please refer to our article Top 15 Pickleball Companies and Brands. Hardest Sport in Asia:If you are from outside of Southeast Asia, you are probably not familiar with the sport called ‘Sepak Takraw’, a sport that is a combination of volleyball, badminton and soccer. Astonishingly visceral and explosive, sepak takraw or kick volleyball, ranks among the toughest sports in the world demanding lightning reflexes, precise control and fearless, gravity-defying leaps. Since the sport is not an Olympic event, it finds its biggest stage at the Asian Games, where Thailand has been the dominant country by a margin. Sports Sponsorships and Endorsements:Sports have become a gigantic industry generating hundreds of billions of dollars in revenue every year, and a large part of this revenue is contributed by sponsorship deals and endorsements. While companies generally sponsor entire teams and events, they can also pay individual athletes to advocate for their brands. A big example of this is the symbiotic partnership between NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and the basketball legend Michael Jordan. NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) welcomed the legendary Chicago Bulls shooting guard into the family back in 1984, with an upfront commitment of $250,000 and Jordan’s very own signature shoe line. During the 2022 financial year, the Air Jordan brand by NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) generated a revenue of $5.1 billion, with Jordan himself reportedly pocketing around 5%, or around $256.1 million – that’s double his entire NBA career earnings in just a single year. Michael Jordan has earned an estimated $1.3 billion from his deal with NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) and the two partners even signed a lifetime deal back in 2020. The European champion and Premier League golden boot winner, Erling Haaland, also extended his sponsorship deal with NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) in March 2023, worth an estimated $24 million. Innovations and Disruptions in the Sports Market:Live sporting events are a special type of content that attracts a lot of viewers and subscribers. Every year, Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX), CBS and NBC – owned by Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), collectively pay the NFL $3 billion for the rights to broadcast the league’s games. In 2021, the NFL signed an 11 year media rights deal, worth an estimated $110 billion, with CBS, Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX), NBC, ESPN, and Amazon.com,Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The deal will commence in 2023.After the deal, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) will be able to live-stream Thursday Night Football via their Amazon Prime Video app. This adds to Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) live portfolio, including Premier League soccer in the U.K. and ATP Tour tennis. The shift to streaming sports via OTT platforms is becoming increasingly apparent, particularly with the recent news of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Major League Soccer (MLS) signing a 10 year global streaming rights deal, worth $2.5 billion. It’s a hybrid model – the coming together of a rights-holder-branded direct-to-consumer (D2C) service. Lionel Messi recently announced that he has found a new home and signed a deal with Inter Miami in the MLS, which has come as a big win for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Having arguably the best player in the game instantly makes the MLS Season Pass subscription, available through Apple TV Plus – the streaming platform of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) – much more appealing, especially for the global audience that might otherwise be more interested in European soccer. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) etc. have rewritten the agenda for video on demand entertainment, so it’s natural that live sports fans now also expect the same level of consistency in streaming delivery. D2C platforms have responded to this challenge, and they are gaining traction. The Future of ESPN: ESPN is an American multinational sports media conglomerate owned majorly by The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS). ESPN’s place in a future streaming-dominated sports world could be as an aggregator, rather than a broadcaster. The network is considering adding links to its website and app that would direct users to live sports streaming broadcasts, including the ones that don’t appear on ESPN. A hub for sports streaming could address consumer frustration of having to figure out where to watch live sports. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) also launched a sports streaming platform ESPN+ in 2018, believing that a shift from ESPN’s traditional cable model to streaming is inevitable for the network. Future Outlook of Sports Streaming:The global sports market grew from $486.61 billion in 2022, to $512.14 billion in 2023, with a CAGR of 5.2%, thus indicating the industry’s massive economic potential.While the big four U.S. professional leagues appear to be more advanced than their European counterparts in exploring the potential of D2C platforms, the next 10 years may tell a different story. According to a report by Ampere Analysis, OTT platforms will spend over $8 billion on sports rights in 2023, to reach 21% of global sports rights investment, up from 13% in 2022. The success and failure of any D2C platform lies in addressing many live streaming issues, including scalability, personalization, latency, picture quality, monetization etc. Until these issues are properly addressed, the current importance of linear media rights revenue in professional sports economics means that we are still away from reaching a point where D2C services are used as the primary distribution platforms by most sports-rights holders. With that said, let's move on to the list of the most demanding sports in the world. 15 Hardest Sports in the World RankedPixabay/Public DomainMethodology: To collect data for this article, we have referred to the following sources: ESPN, SportyTell, Sports Virsa and Bscholar, and looked for rankings of the hardest sports in the world. Then we calculated the weighted average for each sport according to its position in the above-mentioned sources and ranked it accordingly in our list. We assigned the highest weightage (0.4 out of 1) to the ESPN's index's rankings, and a weight of 0.2 each to SportyTell, Sports Visa and Bscholar's indexes. There's variation in weights for sports we found on multiple of these indexes but not all four of them. If you’re a gamer and you’re interested in reading our take on investing in Esports, please read 10 Best Esports Stocks to Buy Now. Here are the toughest sports in the world ranked:15. SwimmingWeighted Average Score: 23.2Swimming may be a pleasant afternoon activity for some people, while others see it as a competitive sport that requires immense strength and endurance. However, speed and strength can only get an athlete so far. Beyond this, they must rely on strong technique to get them through the race. Every stroke in a race matters and swimmers must constantly run through drills during practice to perfect their strokes. Several multinational companies, such as Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Unilever PLC (NYSE:UL) have signed sponsorship deals with professional swimmers. Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) signed a yearly sponsorship deal worth $0.5 million with American swimmer Katie Ledecky in January 2022. Another athlete officially sponsored by Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) is the British swimmer Adam Peaty.  14. Figure SkatingWeighted Average Score: 13.6 The main reason why figure skating is such a uniquely demanding sport is that it is simultaneously an athletic and artistic form of creative expression. Both sport and art, athletic display and dance, figure skaters must learn two very different ways of relating to the discipline and then integrate it all seamlessly into one beautiful program. United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) has partnered with the U.S. Olympic Committee for over 35 years and is an official sponsor of the U.S. Figure Skating Team. An official licensee of the team is NBC Sports, owned by the Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA). 13. Bull RidingWeighted Average Score: 12.2Straddled atop a 2,000 pound bucking bull is the ideal place to appreciate the perils of bull riding. The bulls used in competitive bull riding are selectively bred for a predisposition to buck, which means they are especially sensitive to any negative stimulus, such as the riders they are trying to buck off. With an estimated rate of injury of 1 every 15 rides, bull riding is a worthy inclusion in our Ranking of the Toughest Sports in the World. Monster Energy, owned by the Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) has been an official sponsor of Professional Bull Riders (PBR) riders and events since 2011. PBR boasts an annual attendance of 3 million fans, and the sport is available in more than 400 million homes on television. 12. Cross-Country RunningWeighted Average Score: 10.5Cross-country athletes are often less visible than other athletes, but cross-country running is definitely one of the hardest sports physically and mentally and requires a lot of dedication and discipline. Cross-country runners are a unique breed who push themselves against their limits. They run during rain or under scorching sun and don’t let their pain get the best of them. The leading fitness technology company Garmin Ltd. (NASDAQ:GRMN) signed a two-year deal in 2021, to become the title sponsor of the Garmin RunningLane Cross Country Championships. 11. RugbyWeighted Average Score: 9.4Rugby has been called ‘a thug’s game played by gentlemen’ and on the surface, that description seems to fit the sport. Rugby combines athleticism with toughness and is played without any protective gear. Athletes must exhibit strength, endurance and speed, and with all the tackling and hitting going on, it comes as no surprise that rugby is a part of our Rankings of the World’s Hardest Sports. Each player performs an average of 20 to 40 tackles per match, and an estimated 1 in every 4 players get injured during the season. The BT Group has one season remaining on a three-year deal worth around $140 million with Premiership Rugby. BT Sport will rebrand as TNT Sport and show Premiership and European rugby from next season, following the merger between BT Group and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD). 10. SoccerWeighted Average Score: 9.2Soccer requires an intense amount of stamina, as players usually have to run between 7-10 miles per game. This includes sprinting, sliding, tackling, jumping and the sport also demands keen mental awareness, as players need to continuously read the game as it goes on. Creativity and technique also play a key role in the most popular sport in the world, as a single moment of magic could be enough to make the difference between total ecstasy and despair, for millions. Soccer is also one of the strongest sports in the world financially and has witnessed some juggernaut deals for sponsorships and TV rights. In May 2021, the Premier League confirmed that it would extend its television deal worth approximately $7 billion, until the end of the 2024-25 campaign. Sky Sports, owned by the Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), TNT Sports, owned by Warner Bros., Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Amazon Prime, owned by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) are some of the companies that acquired the said TV rights. The Premier League clubs also spent a total of $966 million on transfer fees last season. 9. Water PoloWeighted Average Score: 9.2Next up on our List of Hardest Sports in the World is the high-intensity Olympic sport of water polo. Played in a deep pool of at least 1.8 meters, the water sport is highly regarded in terms of physicality, as there is a lot of kicking and grabbing going on under the surface, other than the throwing and catching happening above it. The speed and durability required by players, as well as the necessity to avoid drowning without being allowed to touch the ground, make water polo one of the Top 10 Hardest Sports in the World. The U.S. Water Polo team has a number of partners and sponsors, including KAP7 and Anti Wave etc. 8. BasketballWeighted Average Score: 8.1Basketball is hard to play because it requires a high level of physical fitness, especially with all the non-stop running that players do up and down the court. Also, basketball skills take a lot of time to master and performing certain actions in the game needs a very high level of accuracy, agility, teamwork and body coordination. Basketball is also the hardest sport to go pro in. Unless you’re above 6 foot 3 inches, you have a very low chance of making it big. Only about 0.008% of high school basketball players turn pro. The NBA currently makes $2.66 billion a year from The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) under its current deal, which will expire following the 2024-25 season. It’s aiming to get twice as much after. 7. WrestlingWeighted Average Score: 6.6Another clear contender in our list of toughest sports in the world, wrestling requires a combination of physical and mental determination, endurance, speed and tactfulness. The best wrestlers train for hours on end in gymnasiums until they’re ready to compete. Some wrestlers also need to cut weight before their matches to meet their required weight class, and many times, this happens through dehydration or consuming a low-calorie diet. In April 2023, Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EDR), the parent company of UFC, announced a deal to acquire World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc (NYSE:WWE) and form a new public company. The deal values UFC at $12.1 billion and World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc (NYSE:WWE) at $9.3 billion. Endeavor Group Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:EDR) will hold a 51% controlling share in the new company, while shareholders of World Wrestling Entertainment, Inc (NYSE:WWE) will hold a 49% stake. 6. MotocrossWeighted Average Score: 5.5Initially developed from motorcycle trials, motocross is a sport that requires a great amount of skill. Riders perform tricks like leaps, ditches and trespassing, while riding on winding, challenging routes across harsh terrain. It is one of the toughest and most physically demanding sports, with high jumps and often risky landings that frequently result in gruesome injuries and accidents. Monster Energy, owned by the Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), recently extended its Supercross title sponsorship until 2025.

It is seeking to put in place a new set of higher capital requirements, known as Basel 3, that will force some to hold greater buffers against losses.These tougher rules were already in the works before the collapse of several regional US banks in the spring. In the wake of those troubles, regulators made it clear that they wanted to make sure their new approach applied to institutions similar in size to First Republic or a Silicon Valley Bank. Both had more than $200 billion in assets at the time of their failures.Powell said last week he does not expect smaller community banks to be subject to the higher capital requirements, which are expected to be proposed sometime this summer. Institutions with at least $100 billion in assets may have to comply.Powell was asked repeatedly by Republicans on Capitol Hill last week about the risks of imposing higher capital requirements and how much capital is too much capital. The Fed chair acknowledged that higher requirements trade-off balancing a more stable banking system against the potential for less lending.Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing before Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee at Dirksen Senate Office Building on June 22, 2023 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) (Alex Wong via Getty Images)“Much will depend on getting the specifics right, and we should bear in mind that there are always trade-offs in any financial regulation,” Powell said Thursday. “In addition, the US has benefited from its rich, multi-tiered banking ecosystem, and that diversity should be preserved.”Powell said the banking system is much stronger as a result of the capital requirements and safeguards built around the largest banks since the financial crisis in 2008.Story continues“The events of the past couple of months would have been much more difficult to manage had the largest banks been undercapitalized or illiquid,” he said.Powell’s observations come after the Fed released the results of its annual stress tests on Wednesday. These showed that all 23 US banks required to undergo the test could continue lending to households and businesses during a hypothetical severe recession. They had capital levels equivalent to more than 10% in aggregate, well above the 4.5% buffer the central bank requires.“The bank runs and failures in 2023, however, were painful reminders that we cannot predict all of the stresses that will inevitably come with time and chance,” Powell said Thursday. “We therefore must not grow complacent about the financial system’s resilience.”]"

Companies large and small are constantly undertaking shakeups in their business strategies and management teams as they seek a competitive edge in the marketplace. Long tenured CEO positions are becoming increasingly rare in the business world, particularly among publicly traded companies where shareholders demand results. To be sure, running a competitive and profitable company hasn’t gotten any easier in the last few years with a global pandemic, the highest rates of inflation in 40 years, interest rate hikes and the longest bear market in stocks since after World War II. With so much change underway, now may be the time to jump on these stocks to buy during corporate shakeups.Alibaba (BABA)The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the backgroundSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.comNews arrived very recently of a major executive shakeup at Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba (NYSE:BABA). Markets were shocked when it was announced that Alibaba CEO Daniel Zhang would step down to focus on the company’s cloud intelligence business and be replaced by Eddie Wu, a co-founder of the company who has long been involved in technology development. News of the executive change comes as Alibaba restructures into six separate business groups, representing the biggest reorganization in the company’s history.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAlibaba is trying to aggressively boost its business amid an economic slowdown in China, and after the government in Beijing spent two years cracking down on the e-commerce concern, slapping it with a record $2.8 billion antitrust fine. While the restructuring and executive shakeup create some near-term uncertainty at Alibaba, it is still one of the top stocks to buy during corporate shakeups. Now especially looks to be an opportune time to buy BABA stock with it down 17% over the past year. Michael Burry, has been buying the stock in recent months, betting on a China rebound.Story continuesAdidas (ADDYY)Source: ShutterstockBjorn Gulden, who previously ran rival sneaker company Puma (OTCMKTS:PUMSY) for nearly a decade, assumed the CEO role at German footwear giant Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) at the start of this year. He replaced Kasper Rorsted, who had served as CEO of Adidas since 2016 and steered the global brand through the Covid-19 pandemic when its stores were closed and its supply chains thrown into disarray. In announcing the management shakeup, the board at Adidas said it is trying to “pave the way for a restart” at the 74-year-old company. In addition to the ravages of the pandemic, Adidas has also struggled due to its messy divorce from rapper Kanye West, whose Yeezy brand of sneakers had been a global bestseller for the company. But after severing ties with the controversial artist, Adidas found itself with millions of pairs of unsold Yeezy shoes sitting in warehouses around the world. Adidas has estimated that it is sitting on $1.3 billion of unsold Yeezy-branded sneakers. CEO Gulden decided to sell the Kanye West sneakers again and give a portion of the sales to charity.ADDYY stock is trending in the right direction, having gained 39% in 2023. However, the share price remains 44% lower than where it was trading at before the pandemic struck in March 2020.Under Armour (UAA)the exterior of an Under Armour storeSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comAnother global sports apparel brand that has a new CEO is Under Armour (NYSE:UAA). Stephanie Linnartz joined the company that specializes in sneakers and workout clothing as its new president and CEO on February 27. Linnartz previously served as president of hotel chain Marriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) and is a brand specialist. At Under Armor she has been tasked with helping to boost the company’s profile and better compete against rival brands such as Adidas.Indeed, Linnartz has called 2023 “a year of building for the brand.” How long it takes for Linnartz to execute a turnaround strategy at the company remains to be seen. She recently completed her first earnings print at Under Armour. Although the company’s financial results beat Wall Street expectations, the stock slid lower on disappointing forward guidance.

Even better if you can buy them when they have improving earnings estimates and high Zacks Ranks, as this further improves the near-term odds of the stock trading higher.By scanning the Zacks Rank, I have identified three top-ranked stocks with exactly these characteristics. Copart CPRT, Akami Technologies AKAM, and Salesforce CRM all have numerous bullish catalysts acting in their favor.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCopartCopart is a global online vehicle auction and remarketing platform founded in 1982. It facilitates the buying and selling of vehicles through its digital marketplace, serving individuals, dealerships, and insurance companies. With operations at over 200 locations in 11 countries, Copart has more than 250,000 vehicles available online every day.The company focuses on advanced technologies and data analytics to enhance the auction experience. Copart's efficient processes and extensive network have established its position as a leading player in the automotive industry with an estimated 40% market share in the auction market.CPRT stock has been an exceptional performer over the last 10 years compounding at an annual rate of 27.4% and returning 1,026% over that time. Also, over that period annual sales have steadily increased from $1.1 billion to $3.7 billion, and EPS have grown from $0.39 to $2.41 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCopart enjoys a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Analysts have unanimously upgraded earnings expectations across timeframes, with current quarter earnings estimates revised 3.5% higher and FY23 earnings estimates revised nearly 4% higher. Additionally, current quarter earnings are projected to grow 5.3% YoY and FY23 earnings are expected to climb 9% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesCPRT is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple 36.7x, which is above the industry average of 32.7x and above its five-year median of 32x. However, as the leading auction platform in the industry, it is understandable that Copart earns a premium valuation.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAkami Technologies Akamai Technologies is a global content delivery network (CDN) and cloud services provider founded in 1998. The company offers solutions to accelerate and secure the delivery of online content, applications, and media. With a robust network infrastructure and advanced CDN technology, Akamai serves clients across various industries, optimizing website performance and providing cloud security against cybersecurity threats. Akamai remains a leading player in the digital content space, continuously adapting to meet evolving industry demands.AKAM has experienced strong upgrades in its earnings estimates, demonstrated by its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 5.2% and are projected to grow 4.5% YoY. FY23 earnings have increased by 5.5% over the last two months and are forecast to climb 7.5% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAkami Technologies is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 19.8x, which is below the industry average of 23.9x, and below its 10-year median of 26.3x. With a valuation below its historic average and continued earnings growth, AKAM looks quite appealing.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSalesforceSalesforce is a cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) platform that offers a suite of tools and services to manage sales, marketing, customer service, and analytics. Founded in 1999, Salesforce has become a global leader in CRM solutions, providing businesses with a centralized hub for storing and managing customer data.The platform offers customization options and integrations to meet specific business needs. With its user-friendly interface and scalability, Salesforce enables organizations to strengthen customer relationships and drive growth through efficient CRM management.After a major restructuring earlier this year which involved laying off some 12,000 employees to increase profits, CRM has been one of the leading stocks in the market. The stock is up an impressive 59% YTD.Momentum seems to have taken ahold of Salesforce stock as the chart looks like it is ready for its next leg higher. The technical pattern below indicates that if CRM can clear the $214 level, it may very well initiate another bull run to new YTD highs. But, if the stock can’t hold above the $205 level, the pattern is invalid, and investors can wait for another trade setup.TradingViewImage Source: TradingViewFurther improving the odds that CRM rallies again are its upward trending earnings revisions. Salesforce currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Current quarter earnings estimates have been revised higher by 12.4% and are expected to climb a whopping 60% YoY. FY23 earnings estimates have been upgraded by 4.6% and are projected to increase 42% YoY.Sales for the software giant are expected to grow ~10% YoY across timeframes, so clearly the restructuring has been successful in boosting the bottom line.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSalesforce has managed to engineer something rather unique. Despite considerable stock appreciation over the last year, its earnings multiple has more than halved thanks to the massive increase in profits. CRM is trading at a one-year forward multiple of 39.7x, which is above the industry average of 33.5x, and below its five-year median of 122x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineInvestors using Zacks proprietary research don’t need to look far to find high quality investment ideas. While timing the market is an incredibly difficult activity, investors’ odds of success can be greatly increased by trading only stocks on the Zacks Rank #1 list, which regularly outperform the market.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The telecom giant is introducing a cloud-based router management dashboard, coupled with advanced security features, to empower businesses of all sizes to address their performance, security and visibility needs from a centralized location.In a move to cater to the diverse requirements of businesses, Verizon is offering these solutions as simple-to-add enhancements to its fixed-wireless plans, eliminating the need for special equipment or in-house IT support. This means that businesses can take advantage of the new features without any installation hassles, enabling them to focus on their core operations.Key among the offerings is the Verizon Business Internet Portal, accessible via verizon.com. The portal allows businesses to monitor and self-manage their entire portfolio of fixed-wireless connections, irrespective of the router manufacturer.

It allows organizations to manage equipment across physical locations and remote work setups, ensuring seamless connectivity and efficient operations.Verizon is also introducing two tiers of its Verizon Business Internet Security (VBIS) service, available as paid enhancements to LTE or 5G Business Internet plans. VBIS offers network-native security features, including ransomware protection, phishing prevention, malware defense, malicious website blocking and more. These security services can be activated immediately, requiring no additional installation and are easily managed through the Verizon Business Internet Portal.The integration of security services at the Internet gateway protects devices from accessing malicious content or visiting harmful websites, bolstering the overall cybersecurity of businesses. The portal provides insightful logs and reports on blocked threats, offering businesses visibility into their security defenses.These enhancements by Verizon Business come at a time when fixed wireless access (FWA) connections are projected to grow rapidly, with multi-location businesses driving the demand. By offering a cloud-based management portal and network-native security, Verizon ensures that businesses can easily monitor and configure their FWA connectivity, regardless of their IT infrastructure size. This streamlined approach not only improves flexibility and scalability but also reinforces the value proposition of FWA for businesses across sectors.Verizon's initiative aligns with the growing cybersecurity concerns faced by businesses of all sizes. With the rising costs of cyberattacks, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, VBIS provides a comprehensive solution that simplifies cybersecurity setup and reduces vulnerabilities.

Incorporating this service will differentiate DCV as a first mover in the tokenization of assets whilst providing its clients with one platform, based on a consolidated view and single access point across all asset classes.The technology leverages digital asset capabilities developed by Nasdaq and is fully integrated with its Central Security Depository solution, DCV Evolución. The new service will reduce manual processes, settlement times, and time to market for future enhancements and offerings.“Market infrastructures are increasingly looking for ways to embrace tokenization, driven by an accelerating global trend towards leveraging existing securities systems and payment rails to service emerging asset classes,” said Roland Chai, Executive Vice President and Head of Marketplace Technology at Nasdaq. “Nasdaq’s technology allows providers to continue serving traditional securities, whilst capturing the many opportunities across digitized assets. The expansion of our partnership with DCV puts them at the forefront of this secular shift.”DCV will leverage smart contracts to store information related to the underlying security and its ownership, thereby enabling them to automate asset servicing procedures such as managing interest payments or time-consuming legal processes.“With a solid focus on the client, at DCV we recognize the need to move towards a modern capital market, with access to world-class standards and technology that allows agility and simplicity in the processes without neglecting the security that our business and our clients need. This is the vision that has mobilized us to advance in the DCV Digital project hand in hand with Nasdaq,” said Rodrigo Roblero, CEO at DCV. “We are interested in being a relevant player in the world of tokenizing assets to deliver an applicable service that helps to improve the processes of issuing instruments.”Story continuesWhile DCV will initially launch digitized securities using a central private database, the technology is DLT-enabled to support the issuance, registry and settlement of tokenized assets on distributed ledgers as the broader ecosystem evolves. Nasdaq’s CSD technology is fully interoperable with other depositories and can be readily integrated into existing and future payment networks.This announcement marks a significant expansion in Nasdaq’s partnership with DCV. Last year, the company replaced its legacy system with Nasdaq’s CSD platform which significantly enhanced the performance, speed, and scalability of its offering, increasing the processing speed of its operations over one hundred times faster. With these improvements, DCV has been able to enhance services across the Chilean financial ecosystem as well as more easily access international investors with standardized operations, messaging, and data infrastructure. For this reason, the company was awarded “Most Innovative Financial Infrastructure Company in Chile” last November.Nasdaq’s Marketplace Technology business serves as one of the world's largest market infrastructure technology providers, providing multi-asset solutions to more than 130 marketplaces, CCPs, CSDs and regulators in over 50 countries. It offers reliable and scalable technology across the trade lifecycle, helping organizations to drive efficiency, transparency, and liquidity with unparalleled resiliency.About Nasdaq Nasdaq (Nasdaq: NDAQ) is a global technology company serving the capital markets and other industries.

From the people who power our teams, to the products we create, the stories we tell, and the groups we partner with - we work every day to foster a more inclusive workplace and ensure that all our teammates feel supported, embraced, and heard.As part of this, we make it a point to come together annually across the organization for DE&amp;I Day, a time to pause and reflect as an organization, celebrate our commitment to action, and be intentional about where we want to go.On April 26, tens of thousands of teammates tuned in to our broadcast, either virtually or in-person at one of over 175 watch parties hosted at locations across the globe.Our program not only included updates from executive leadership but also featured unique stories of teammates who are leading inclusively and helping to drive our efforts forward. We also engaged in a shared learning focused on helping us better understand social identities and dimensions of diversity.As I reflect on the incredible day, three powerful messages have really resonated with me:1. When we're encouraged to be who we are, we do our best work.A truly diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace is one where everyone is welcomed and included as their authentic self. Our inclusive culture centers around empowering all teammates to feel valued and celebrated for their contributions and inspiring them to feel comfortable bringing their whole self to work.We all bring a set of identities into the workplace, and learning how to understand our differences is key to bringing out the best in everyone. Taking time to understand the many social identities we all bring to the table and connecting through these differing backgrounds and perspectives allows us to collaborate, innovate, and ultimately, help foster a more inclusive workplace.Here's what authenticity in the workplace means for some of our teammates.Story continues2. Our inclusive culture inspires teammates to give back to their communities.While our commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion starts at home, we're deeply invested in the communities we serve and the small businesses that shape them.From the incredible local businesses that we support through Comcast RISE, to the neighborhoods we help through our WiFi-enabled Lift Zones, and the investments we make to advance digital equity through Project UP, our team members embody our mission to help build a future of unlimited possibilities.Through Team UP, our always-on volunteerism and employee engagement program, our teammates are giving back and making a meaningful difference in record numbers. This DE&amp;I Day, we asked employees to Team UP by participating in Letters to UP Lift, a companywide volunteer letter writing project aimed to inspire high school students to be their authentic self.3. Continuous learning is key to ongoing progress.While we've come a long way on our DE&amp;I journey, our work is not done. And it's so important to take the lessons learned and apply them to our everyday lives. This summer, teammates will participate in a learning challenge that will build on the concepts shared this DE&amp;I Day.Continuous learning, both as an individual and as an organization, is all about being open-minded, asking questions, and caring for each other. It's a simple concept of listening, valuing feedback and insights, and acting on them - there is always more to learn.We are one team, and with a shared growth mindset and commitment to continuous learning - we can do amazing things together!I'm looking forward to seeing the lasting impact of this year's DE&amp;I Day throughout our organization and how inspiring authenticity in the workplace will shape Comcast for years to come.Loren Hudson is Senior Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer for Comcast Cable.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/comcast-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/764269/Celebrating-Diversity-Equity-Inclusion-at-Comcast]"

(PRU) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prudential-financial-inc-pru-attracting-130006382.html,1687957206,STORY,['PRU'],"[Prudential (PRU) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this financial services company have returned +6.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.2% change. The Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, to which Prudential belongs, has gained 6.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Prudential is expected to post earnings of $3.15 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +81%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $11.93 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +26.1%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.78 indicates a change of +7.1% from what Prudential is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Prudential is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Prudential, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.69 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -7.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $53.64 billion and $53.47 billion estimates indicate -13.1% and -0.3% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPrudential reported revenues of $15.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.6%. EPS of $2.66 for the same period compares with $3.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.29 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.65%. The EPS surprise was -11.92%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Prudential is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Prudential. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 74% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Devon Energy. Check out our latest analysis for Devon Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Devon Energy?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Devon Energy does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Devon Energy's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Devon Energy. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.1% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.6% by the third-largest shareholder.On studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Devon EnergyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Devon Energy Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$189m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 25% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Devon Energy. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   4 warning signs for Devon Energy   (of which 2 are significant!) you should know about.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

Ellison said Ampere's chips are much more power efficient than offerings from its other two major chip suppliers, Advanced Micro Devices and Nvidia.Ellison said that, for regulatory reasons, some Oracle data centers cannot obtain any more electricity, so the only way the company can keep expanding its cloud service is by doing more computing for each watt of power it can access, which is why it has turned to Ampere's chips.""We have got more room. We just don't have more electrical capacity. By upgrading to Ampere, we're able to take that room, double the compute and stay within the same power envelope,"" Ellison said.(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in Menlo Park, California; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)]"

(Operator Instructions) As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. I would now like to introduce your host for today's program, Farhan Ahmad, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.Farhan AhmadThank you, and welcome to Micron Technology's fiscal third quarter 2023 sell-side analyst call back. On the call with today are Sumit Sadana, Micron's Chief Business Officer; Manish Bhatia, our EVP of Global Operations; and Mark Murphy, our CFO. As a reminder, the matters we are discussing today include forward-looking statements regarding market demand and supply, our expected results and other matters. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made today. We refer you to the documents we filed with the SEC, including our most recent Form 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of the risks that may affect our future results. Jonathan, we can now open the Q&amp;A.Question and Answer SessionOperatorAnd our first question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.Story continuesToshiya HariCan you hear me okay?Mark J. MurphyYes, we can hear you.Farhan AhmadYes, Toshiya.Toshiya HariOkay. Great. Mark, maybe on the CAC dynamic. I know there was a question on the main call as to what's assumed in the current quarter. I thought I'd give another shot. What is assumed in terms of potential headwinds from the CAC ruling in China? And I guess on the CAC dynamic, just at a very fundamental level, what's driving the uncertainty with regards to how customers respond. Is it the guideline itself that's uncertain, therefore, like your customers are confused and perplexed as well? Or do the customers know what they need to do, but they're just not telling you? Just curious what's driving the uncertainty.Mark J. MurphyYes. So it's a sensitive matter. So we're not going to talk a lot about it. We're trying to be -- talk to what we know and understand. But the situation is still evolving. There is uncertainty associated with it, and it is challenging. So we have outlined our -- what we view is our exposure, and we view our principal exposure as China-headquartered companies, which we've identified as direct sales to China-headquartered companies or sales of distributors into China-headquartered companies. And that total China exposure, which is the principal exposure is 25%. Now we see the risk associated with our business, which we've sized is about half of that. So that's the potential risk that we see at this time. Now we had very little effect in the third quarter. We expect -- well, we see more of an effect, a more material effect in the fourth quarter and the first quarter, but then we anticipate that working with customers and share redistribution and other things may mitigate the impact. So we've not -- we have a number in our guide, of course, and you can assume that it's not the full amount of the exposure at this time. But I think that's -- hopefully provides you some boundary conditions for the exposure.Toshiya HariGot it. And then as a quick follow-up, another one for you, Mark. Just on cash flow, I think on the call, you guys talked about cash flow likely to -- is likely to remain challenged or extremely challenged for some time. You're sort of calling the bottom on the cycle. Given the supply side cuts, I think working capital hopefully starts to become more positive as opposed to being negative over the coming quarters. So net-net, how should we think about free cash flow potentially returning to positive territory, obviously, not in the near term, but perhaps sometime in fiscal '24, how should we think about the pluses and minuses? And if you can talk to potential government subsidies, whether that be in the U.S. or elsewhere, that would be helpful as well.Mark J. MurphySure. I'll talk about -- to your point, I'll talk a bit about CapEx also. But the speed and the depth of the decline we've had in the business, combined with the node investment cycle that we had early in the downturn resulted in substantial cash flow use, and we saw that in the first quarter, the second quarter and the third quarter with peak use in the second quarter of $1.8 billion. And as we reported, we were at $1.4 billion this third of negative free cash flow. But the market conditions, they remain weak, and we have high fixed costs. So we are trying to remain operating cash flow positive through this period of weakness, and we were able to do that in the third quarter. At these low levels of operating cash flow, though we've reduced CapEx considerably, we expect to be negative free cash flow into and through a good part, if not all, of FY '24, just depends on how the market recovery proceeds and how comfortable we are in the profile of CapEx spend. Now we're always circumspect on capital spending, but we're going to obviously keep it -- keep spending low until we see clear signs of recovery. We've already pulled WFE down 50% year-over-year. Next year, WFE will be lower than this year. It's noteworthy that in the fourth quarter, our WFE is only going to be 20% of the spend. So I mean we've really cut down spending on tools. We are projecting the market to find its footing and improvements to materialize from here and lead TO operating cash flow growth in the second half of FY '24. And as long as we see that coming together, it's reasonable to assume that CapEx levels may be around this year's levels with more of a construction mix than this year and also more back half-weighted given that we want to make sure that the market is recovering before we spend. As mentioned on the call, that would include an increase in HBM spend versus prior plans. And again, the rate and pace of recovery will be in large part driven by, yes, the industry's supply response. So we're being very sensitive about any incremental bit capacity, and there's just some strong actions on the supply side are still needed to -- given where inventories are.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo.Aaron Christopher RakersMark, I got two questions. I want to start with the gross margin, and I apologize for trying to unpack this a little bit further. But as we kind of think about the fact that the inventory charges are now kind of abating, I guess the question is, is that relative to the $300 million positive effect of kind of the sell-through of previously written down inventory? Would you not expect that to potentially trend materially higher over these next couple of quarters? And also in that gross margin, how are we thinking specifically around the wafer reduction underutilization costs? I think you talked about $200 million in fiscal 4Q embedded in the guide. I think in the prior filings, I think in total, there's around $300 million for the full year. Is that still the case? Just trying to think about those 2 variables in particular. Then I got one other question.Mark J. MurphyYes. So there -- let me get started, and you can kind of ask questions along the way because it's a very complicated topic and I want to make sure that we're answering your questions. On the first one, I think your question was around we realized the benefit of lower cost inventories in the third quarter just under $300 million close to what we had expected. And I think your question was how does that look in the next several quarters, and it does increase. We expect about a $500 million benefit in the fourth quarter, then we expect about $500 million in the following 2 quarters. So that's the benefit on that lower cost inventories that sort of as it clears the next several quarters. On your question of the underutilization charges, you have 2 components of that. You have the amount that's in inventories and you have period costs. Interestingly, most of the write-down in the third quarter was related to that underutilization-related costs and inventories. And so that's what makes this complicated on a go-forward basis because you've got a lot of those underutilization costs and inventories get pulled forward to these charges. So that's happened. You have the period costs left behind and as I mentioned on the call, you've got about $200 million of period costs in fourth quarter. You've got another $200 million-ish in the first quarter. And then some of those period costs start to trail off. But I did mention that the underutilization charges -- so the higher cost inventories associated with underutilization charges, they do persist through FY '24 and, obviously, the effect on margin is a function of the revenue. But I said the effect is kind of from high-single digit down to mid-single digit through the year on a percent.Aaron Christopher RakersThat's perfect. My other quick question was just you talked about $6 billion as kind of the normalized inventory level. You're at $8.2 billion. But then you also said that you're carrying about $1 billion or so strategic inventory reserve. When does the latter start to burn off? How do we think about what normalized looks like? Do we think $6 billion is the right number? Or do we say, ""Hey, when you get to $7 billion, you're going to continue to carry kind of $1 billion of strategic inventory?""Mark J. MurphyNo. I mean there are specific reasons for carrying some of that $1 billion. So I think the way to look at it is we're aspiring to get down to this kind of 120 days. I think that's the way to view it. And we provided that number. Let's not -- we're certainly not trying to say that, that $1 billion is the reason our inventory levels are too much. I mean the majority of our -- of this ""excess"" so to speak or higher inventories that we want, it's not that. And so we're absolutely focused on and serious on our supply response to get our inventory levels down. But we did want to make it clear that we have a new target. That new target is 120 days, and that's up from what we had before of 110, and that's just due to additional process steps in the new technology for complex products. So 120 days is the new target. We do have some strategic intentional builds that adds on top of that at this point, call it, 20 days or so. And so call it, 130, 140 days is kind of where we are in the near term, aspiring to get down by near term, near to medium term, trying to work down to that level probably by the end of '24. And again, it's -- that leaves a considerable amount of inventories to work down to get to that level. One thing I just wanted to clean up here, it came up on the call, and I don't know if Ambrish is going to ask the question, but he asked a question about the third quarter. We said that it would be negative 7.5%. I went back and checked the transcript. And just to be clear, we did say that. But we said if you were just to strip out the impairment charges, so really, it was just the write-down charge. And if you do that -- which is $400 million in our third quarter that we reported. So if you do that, you have a margin of negative 5.4%. So we actually did better than what we said we would do on the call. Now if we adjust for the credit, then the margin is 13% roughly. And -- but I just wanted to mention that since it came up on the call.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley.Joseph Lawrence MooreIn Sanjay's upfront remarks, he talked about the GH200 from NVIDIA and kind of a partnership doing low-power memory for that product. Can you talk a little bit about that? And kind of just generally, when you talk about having a role for low-power DRAM in these kind of bigger AI clusters, what role is that? And what is Micron doing to enable that?Sumit SadanaSo -- this is Sumit. So I'll just give you a quick overview on that. So we have a special partnership in which this product has been developed for LPDRAM to be adapted to the data center. Typically, LPDRAM has not been used in the data center for a number of reasons, including the fact that it doesn't have the vast capabilities, the reliability, availability and serviceability capabilities that data center customers have relied on, on DDR5 and DDR4 products in the past. So there is work to be done to adapt this technology. And then there is some additional features and functionality that are important to deploy that we have worked on to create a differentiated product here that is unique in the industry. It's not a standard LPDRAM product. And so this product has been developed in partnership with NVIDIA, and it's a unique and differentiated product and the overwhelming majority of the 144 terabytes of DRAM is this unique differentiated product that we have codeveloped and will be deployed in volume production. So we're really excited about it. I mean this does significantly reduce power consumption because power consumption is a big challenge in the data center. And bringing low-power DRAM to the data center through products like this one is a big step forward, and we are really excited to be leading the industry on that front.Joseph Lawrence MooreGreat. And then for a follow-up, also on the AI topic. You talked a lot about HBM3, but it seems like there's also a pretty healthy market for 128 gig modules for the main memory. Can you talk about where Micron is in terms of getting qualified for that product?Sumit SadanaSure, yes. So yes, there is -- if you look at the whole spectrum of high capacity memory modules, it's really 96 gigabyte, 128 gigabyte, 256 gigabyte. And the overwhelming majority of the high-capacity module volume is on the 128-gigabyte SKU. Very little on the 256 and the 96-gigabyte SKU is relatively new. We do have a 96-gigabyte product in the high-capacity module offering right now. It has been in volume production since the late part of FQ3, and it will continue to ramp through FQ4. And the rest of fiscal '24, we expect to sell that in increasing volumes. It's -- the 96-gigabyte module actually has performance characteristics that are indistinguishable from the 128-gigabyte module at significantly lower cost per bit because our implementation of the 96-gigabyte module is through a monolithic 24-gigabit die rather than using TSV. And so its cost structure is very, very good, much lower than the higher cost implementation using TSV. We are taking a very similar approach to doing 128-gigabyte modules. We are going to be doing that using a single -- in a monolithic 32-gigabit die in our 1-beta technology for DRAM. And once again, we'll be able to do that without using TSV technology. Of course, we'll use TSV technology for things like HBM. And we spoke about that at length in the last call. But the 128-gigabyte module that we make without TSV is once again going to be the industry's most cost-effective solution, best ROI solution in the market when we bring it out. And we expect it to be starting volume production in CQ2 in calendar '24. And it's making good progress towards that goal. And as mentioned earlier, rounding out the HBM discussion to -- for our AI offerings, our HBM -- HBM3, which is sort of the -- call it, the next generation of HBM3, head and shoulders above current HBM3 products in the market in terms of performance, bandwidth, power consumption. We expect that to be in volume production in CQ1 of '24. So next few months and quarters are going to be very exciting for all of our AI portfolio and the continued ramp of our business in support of the AI offerings.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Sidney HO from Deutsche Bank.Shek Ming HoGreat. I want to go back to the gross margin calculation. Thanks for all the details there. I think, Mark, you mentioned on the call that the fiscal third quarter adjusted gross margin will be 16% -- negative 16%. What would be the same math if we do it for fiscal Q4, including the -- I guess there's some benefit, you talked about $500 million in Q4. And then kind of related to that, when I think about underutilization, you're now at -- down 30%. You said that will continue to be -- well into fiscal 2024. But then you also talk about period cost staying at $200 million through fiscal Q1 and trail off. Does that mean that the utilization you're expecting to start increasing in fiscal second quarter?Mark J. MurphyYes. So -- so let me cover a few things. If we strip out the utilization or the write-down effects in Q4, we would have a negative gross margin of around -- let me -- hold on one second. I'm just going to -- just give me one second.Manish H. BhatiaMaybe while Mark is doing that, Sidney, I can try and answer your question on the wafer start reductions that we talked about. We are reducing wafer starts further from what we had targeted going from 25% to 30%. And then there are -- since we're into the range that Mark talked about, where we're now seeing period costs, that increase from 25% to approaching 30% would be largely captured in period cost increases through some in FQ4 and then into the first half of fiscal '24. And what we really said was that we're planning on -- we're expecting these reductions in wafer starts to be well into fiscal '24. And we're really just keep them in place for as long as it takes to get the inventories in line, our inventories in line and of course, until we see the industry profitability restored or the trajectory to be restored and then we'll bring -- start to bring that capacity back online. As we're going through the year, we will also, as we've said before, utilize some of this equipment towards converting to new nodes more capital efficiently, right? So as we have the -- our 1-beta ramp is going to continue as we have our 232-layer ramp is going to continue. We'll be utilizing some of this equipment towards that -- those conversions. And so that all plays into how the period costs and the inventory charges will work as we move to the -- through the second half of the fiscal '24.Mark J. MurphyYes. And Sidney, just -- I wanted to just double check our numbers against the guide. So we had said that we'd get roughly a $500 million benefit for the lower cost inventories passing through. So if we strip that benefit, the gross margin would go from negative 10.5% to over 20% negative. And just -- since we're talking about this, I want to just maybe clear up some confusion because I wanted to -- there's a lot of different views you can take here, and I just want to make sure it's clear. On a reported basis because we have, obviously, the big charges in the second quarter and the third quarter, and then we don't have charges or don't have write-downs going forward in the forecast, the gross margin was negative 31% in second quarter. It's negative 16% in the reported third quarter. We've guided to negative 10% -- 10.5%. And we would expect the reported gross margin to continue to improve into fiscal -- gradually into fiscal '24 and then eventually be positive sometime in the second half of fiscal '24. Now if we -- if you take our non-GAAP gross margin in third quarter of negative 16% and you strip out all the effects, and then you think about, okay, what is the -- what is the effect going forward with all these effects stripped out, I said on the call that under this adjusted view, we trough over the next few quarters, and then we would improve off these low levels through FY '24. So an example of a troughing is the question you just asked where you strip out the effects and you end up with a negative 20-plus percent gross margin. And we would expect the same effect if you adjusted for the benefit passing through. If you strip that out, we would see the same negative 20-plus percent gross margin in the first quarter, and then it would begin to improve. And then eventually, you're back to normal, there's no more low-cost inventories passing through. But then you pick up just -- you get back in sync with the reported gross margins. And so again, in the second half of the fiscal year, you eventually have positive gross margin. So hopefully, that's clear.Shek Ming HoThat's great. Maybe one quick one. If I -- you guys talked about some of your customers considering strategic buys, and we've heard that from some of the OEMs as well. What does that mean to demand -- the demand for your products in future quarters? Do they just become a pooling of demand into the current -- the next quarter? Or do they -- do the customers lock in a low price, but the delivery is still in the future? Can you just walk us through the different scenarios? That would be great.Sumit SadanaTypically, we provide the pricing only for the quarter in which the product is shipped. So if a customer is interested in purchasing more than, call it, the natural demand in this quarter, then to get the current price, they would have to take the shipments in this quarter because typically, the price would have to be attached to the time frame for which -- and would have to be competitive and appropriate for the time frame in which the shipments are being made to the customers. Now sometimes, some customers purchase inventory and pass them at third parties which have a business model to carry these inventories for certain monthly costs, and that has been done in the past. But I will say that the end-to-end inventories are improving and the third-party inventories have gone down substantially over the course of the last few months for both DRAM and NAND, but much more so for DRAM. The reductions in inventories and third parties has been very (technical difficulty) for DRAM in the last [several months]. So -- but this is how we do it with customers.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities.Vivek AryaFor my first one, I'm curious, what's your current level of kind of D5 sales and HBM sales exposure? And where do you see it going over the next year?Sumit SadanaWell, we have provided input that our D5 sales, we expect to continue to increase as our mix of shipments moves more and more towards D5 versus D4. And we have provided some input that we expect our D5 volumes to cross over D4 in our shipments on the end of calendar Q1 in 2024, and we expect the industry D5 shipments to cross over D4 towards the middle of calendar 2024. So we have been leading the industry in terms of D5 capability, performance, quality and so on for -- since the time D5 was introduced, in fact. And so our mix of D5 continues to be ahead of that of the industry in our business. As it relates to your question on HBM, we did have volume production of HBM2E, which was the prior generation of HBM. And we got very good learnings out of that, and we got a decent amount of revenue there. But that was towards the tail end of the HBM2E market adoption curve, which moved quite rapidly to HBM3. And as we mentioned before, our ramp of HBM3, actually the sort of the next generation of HBM3, which is a much higher level of performance bandwidth and lower power than what is in production in HBM3 today in the industry, that product, our industry-leading product will be ramping in volume starting CQ1 of 2024 and will be meaningful in revenue for fiscal year '24 and then substantially larger in 2025, even from those 2024 levels. And we will -- we are targeting a very robust share in HBM higher than our natural supply share for DRAM in the industry.Vivek AryaVery helpful. And then maybe, Mark, one for you on gross margins. So let's say -- hypothetically, let's say, your Q1 sales, units ASP are all kind of flat sequentially. What happens to gross margins on a reported basis?Mark J. MurphyYes. I'm not going to -- we're not guiding the first quarter, Vivek, but what I will do is provide you -- because we still have price declines forecast in the near term. And however, the market is stabilizing, and then we see prices firming up and improving in the second half. So maybe just take the opportunity here even though, just to maybe do some housekeeping related to your question. And I give this -- we've given guidance in the fourth quarter, of course, but there's a lot of variability in this market transition phase we're in and then of course, the CAC headwind. But I'll give you a sense of some trends beyond the fourth quarter. But maybe on bits. In the fourth quarter, we do see record bits shipments for both DRAM and NAND. And both DRAM and NAND will have strong bit growth on a sequential basis. NAND bit growth is a bit higher than DRAM. In the first half of fiscal '24, we see bits at a similar level to fiscal fourth quarter '23 but some quarterly variability due to CAC effects. Bits should be stronger in the second half of '24 than the first half, of course, as the industry recovery progresses and customer inventories are normalized and as we manage through the CAC effects. On pricing, pricing in DRAM is better than NAND at the moment in terms of quarter-on-quarter changes. Within the second half of calendar '23, pricing and margins begin stabilizing and increasing. On costs, costs in third quarter were up around mid-single digits in DRAM and NAND, and that's impacted by underutilization. In the fourth quarter, underutilization is going up, but we will see some benefits from cost downs. And so altogether, cost reductions in the fourth quarter are flat to up basically. On CY '24, underutilization and resulting cost headwinds will continue. And then FY '24, we'll have muted cost reductions despite progress on cost downs. And then of course, all this is -- the pace and timing of wafer start reductions will yes, it depends on the recovery timing. So as volumes increase on wafer starts, of course, the cost will come down on a bit basis. But I think that provides you some profile.Farhan AhmadAnd Mark, if I could -- Vivek, did that answer your question?Vivek AryaYes. Actually, what I was really trying to get at is, let's say, if we take the ASP right out of the equation, like what helps gross margins get better sequentially? Is it a reflection of ASP because your utilization is perhaps not going to improve, cost downs don't seem to be changing and the inventory that has been written down, that $500 million number stays flat from Q4 to Q1. So I'm trying to understand what helps gross margins go up sequentially other than ASPs?Farhan AhmadYes. So, I mean, you're right, I mean, there isn't that much moving things left. The cost you were -- as you said, the utilization is still probably not going to come down or the wafer start reduction will not come down. But you will get the benefit of little bit technology penetration increasing, 1-beta continuing to increase. So you'll get some benefit on the cost but not a big shift. The primary driver of our margins is ASP.Mark J. MurphyYes, and Vivek, this is why we're so focused on the supply response because the industry inventory levels need to improve and -- which we have seen broad-based supply response. So we see positive actions there. And we do have forecasted that pricing begins to firm up and then recover in fiscal '24.Farhan AhmadYes. And one more thing Vivek, as we said on the earnings call, the mix between the NAND and DRAM is much bigger variable for our gross margins because the margin difference between the two is very big. So that -- any sensitivity around that can have big changes. So just keep that in mind.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Karl Ackerman from BNP Paribas.Karl AckermanI was hoping you could remind us how long it typically takes to qualify your products and how that varies between data center and consumer applications? The reason why I'm asking is, I guess, should we think about the CAC impact and mitigation factors being similar to traditional views of price elasticity such that as long as the memory density and the form factor does not change, then changes can be fairly immediate, or are customers more inclined to make changes on the next product cycle? Any thoughts on that would be super helpful.Sumit SadanaSure. Yes. I mean I think there are different scenarios depending on the customer and the product. The most high-volume products that we have, for example, in DRAM are already qualified at multiple customers around the world, and we have a certain share at individual customers that can be flagged up or down depending on customer needs and our own supply and so on. So in a lot of situations, the products are already qualified. It's a matter of an allocation of share to Micron versus others that our customers go through. And so those type of volume shifts are not dependent on any kind of additional calls taking place. In some cases, some additional calls may have to happen for the same product going into newer platforms. Those tend to be shorter when the product is already in volume production at a given customer in other SKUs. Then if there are actual share gains to be had at new customers or new products are to be ramped that have not been broadly qualified before, then those go through a regular qualification cycle. And that qualification cycle, again, varies based on products for client platforms, whether it is SSDs or DRAM. It could be about a quarter, 3 months or so for data center platforms. It tends to be longer both on SSDs and DRAM platforms. So typically, it could take more than 3 months to get qualified. Some cases, 6 months also is possible. But those are, again, for situations where the product is new or a new generation of DRAM or NAND node is ramping or it's a completely new customer or a completely new application. But in the majority of cases, where mainstream products shipping in volume, we tend to have a fairly broad set of qualifications already done, and it's a matter of share shifts.Karl AckermanGot it. No, that's super helpful. If I may ask another follow-up. I guess is your -- is the outlook for calendar '23 bit demand, which has been reduced -- lower this call, is that driven by the recent restrictions on your collective China business? Or is the reduction in demand driven by a view that some customers have stocked up bits at attractive prices. It may take longer to reduce the memory inventory. I just want to -- hoping to clarify that.Sumit SadanaSorry, can you repeat what the question -- which reduction are you referring to?Manish H. BhatiaThe bit demand.Sumit SadanaThe bit demand? Yes.Manish H. BhatiaIt's really more about, that comment we made -- Sumit, can comment -- can fill in. But the comment we made was for the industry, and it's really driven by some of the reductions in TAM that we see for smartphones and PCs that are both going to have somewhat lower unit sales than what we were forecasting before.Sumit SadanaYes. I mean, that CY '23 is not a Micron statement. It is an industry TAM reduction, and it has nothing to do with the CAC. It's to do with a reduction in volume forecast of units. We have reduced our unit shipment estimates for PCs into double digits -- low double digits, that is taking the PC units to a level that is now well below what the PC units were in 2019. And smartphone units are mid-single-digit percentage decline, which is worse than the low single-digit percentage decline we had estimated earlier. And we have also taken some impact into these TAM numbers related to the inventory reduction rate and pace at the data center customers due to the macro environment in terms of how fast that inventory or how -- the pace of the consumption of that inventory at our customers has also contributed somewhat to the reduction in TAM. Offsetting just the TAM reduction though is we have increased our estimate for the level of supply reduction that is taking place. So compared to the last cycle, the last quarter, this quarter's estimate -- while the demand has come down, the supply has come down more. And so we do have a view now that both DRAM and NAND supply is -- currently -- the new production is currently running below the shipment levels and consequently, inventories at producers is going down, but also end-to-end inventories in the supply chain are going down. So customer inventories are improving. Third-party inventories have improved markedly. And certainly, supplier inventories are also improving even as our own volumes are increasing. So the volumes are increasing as an outcome of inventories being reduced throughout the system. And so that's how it's all playing out.Farhan AhmadI know we are out of time, but I just wanted to mention if anybody has any questions, the IR team will be here. I know we couldn't get to everyone today. And the modeling in this time period is particularly challenging with all the moving pieces. So if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to the IR team.OperatorThank you. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may now disconnect. Good day.]"

Good afternoon, everyone. Micron delivered fiscal third quarter revenue within our guidance range with gross margin and EPS above the range. The ongoing improvement of customer inventories and memory content growth are driving higher industry demand while production cuts across the industry continue to help reduce excess supply. As a result, pricing trends are improving, and we have increased confidence that the industry has passed the bottom for both quarterly revenue and year-on-year revenue growth.Our technology leadership and strengthening product portfolio position us well across diverse growth markets, including AI and memory-centric computing. Beyond this downturn, we expect to see record TAM in calendar 2025, along with a return to more normalized levels of profitability.The impact of the May 24 decision by the Cyberspace Administration of China on Micron's business remains uncertain and fluid. Several Micron customers, including mobile OEMs have been contacted by certain critical information infrastructure operators or representatives of the government in China concerning the future use of Micron products.As discussed before, Micron's revenue with companies headquartered in Mainland China and Hong Kong, including direct sales as well as indirect sales through distributors, accounts for approximately 1/4 of Micron's worldwide revenue and remains the principal exposure. We currently estimate that approximately half of that China headquartered customer revenue, which equates to a low double-digit percentage of Micron's worldwide revenue, is at risk of being impacted.This significant headwind is impacting our outlook and slowing our recovery. Micron is working to mitigate this impact over time and expect increased quarter-to-quarter revenue variability. Micron's long-term goal is to retain its worldwide DRAM and NAND share.Turning to technology. Micron continues to lead the industry in both DRAM and NAND technology. We are investing prudently to maintain our technology competitiveness while managing CapEx, node ramps and wafer start reductions to reduce our bit supply and align it with demand. Our industry-leading 1-beta DRAM and 232-layer NAND nodes are achieving world-class yields and the yield ramp for these nodes has been faster than any of our prior nodes. These leadership nodes provide a strong cost capability along with best-in-class power and performance specifications that will be leveraged across the portfolio of DRAM and NAND products.In fiscal Q3, we achieved several important product qualifications on these advanced nodes and are well positioned to ramp them in fiscal 2024. We are also making good progress towards the introduction of our EUV-based 1-gamma node in 2025. This node will be manufactured first in our Taiwan site, where we already have EUV capability installed and operating in preparation for this ramp.We also recently announced plans to bring EUV technology to our fab in Hiroshima, Japan with support from the Japanese government. Micron will be the first company to bring EUV technology to Japan for production.We are also advancing our global assembly and test network in order to support our product portfolio and extend our ability to deliver on global customer demand in the future. In China, we announced an investment of approximately $600 million over the next several years in our operations in Xian. This builds on our long history of significant investment in our Xian assembly, packaging and test operations.As a part of this investment, we have decided to purchase the assembly equipment of our partner, Power Tech Semiconductor Xian, who has been operating inside our Xian facility for the last 8 years. We also intend to construct a new building at our Xian site to provide space to add more product capabilities. This will allow us, over time, to serve more of the demand from our customers in China from the Xian site.In India, with the strong support of the Indian government, we will build a new assembly and test facility in Gujarat to address demand for the latter half of this decade. We are also increasing our investments in assembly and test capacity in Taiwan for high-bandwidth memory products as we gear up for stronger demand in this segment, driven by the AI wave.Now turning to our end markets. Customers continue to make progress in reducing their excess inventory in fiscal Q3. Most customer inventories in the PC and smartphone segments are close to normal levels now consistent with our forecast 6 months ago. Some of these inventory levels can get distorted by customer attempts to leverage current prices, which are deemed to be transient and unsustainable at these levels to purchase additional volumes before prices rise significantly. Data center customer inventory is also improving and will likely normalize around the end of this calendar year or somewhat thereafter, depending on the growth in traditional data center spending.In data center, we saw strong sequential revenue growth in both cloud and enterprise in fiscal Q3, driven by some recovery from depressed sales levels in fiscal Q2. The recent acceleration in the adoption of generative AI is driving higher-than-expected industry demand for memory and storage for AI servers, while traditional server demand for mainstream data center applications continues to be lackluster.Micron's product portfolio and road map of innovative products position us to capture growth opportunities from AI and data-centric computing architectures for both training and inferencing. Increasingly large AI models with an exponentially growing number of parameters are driving demand for dramatically higher memory content.As we have said before, AI servers have 6x to 8x the DRAM content of a regular server and 3x the NAND content. In fact, some customers are deploying AI compute capability with a substantially higher memory content. A striking example is NVDL, DGX, GH 200 supercluster, which shows just how memory-intensive AI workloads can be. It provides developers the ability to support giant models with a massive shared memory space of 144 terabytes.A significant majority of that memory footprint is enabled by a joint development project between our 2 companies that extends Micron's low-power DRAM leadership to server-class applications. We are proud to pioneer this differentiated LP DRAM innovation to deliver a significant reduction in data center power consumption compared to DDR-based solutions helping to support our customers' green initiatives.High-bandwidth memory used in high-performance computing is seeing very strong demand this year, driven by demand for generative AI. We are working closely with our customers and have begun sampling our industry-leading HBM3 product offering.The customer response has been strong, and we believe our HBM3 product delivers significantly higher bandwidth than competing solutions and establishes the new benchmark in performance and consumption supported by our 1 beta technology, TSV and other innovations, enabling a differentiated advanced packaging solution. We expect to begin a mass production ramp for this exciting HBM3 product in early calendar 2024 and to achieve meaningful revenues in fiscal 2024. Micron also has a strong position in the industry transition to D5, which is the latest generation of DDR memory. Our D5 percentage of DRAM shipments has more than doubled from fiscal Q2 to Q3 and we expect Micron D5 volume to cross over D4 at the end of first calendar quarter of 2024 versus mid-calendar 2024 for the industry. Micron's 1 alpha D5 modules are qualified and shipping to data center customers. We are also making good progress on our 1 beta-based high-density 128 gigabyte D5 modules using a 32 gigabit die that optimizes cost and performance to provide customers with a lower cost of ownership solution for memory-intensive workloads like AI. We expect these high-density modules to ramp in calendar Q2 of 2024 and with significant cost improvements over today's expense sales, TSV-based solutions in the industry. Our 96-gigabyte D5 high-density module built on 1 alpha technology using 24 gigabit die is already shipping in volume and delivers equivalent performance for the majority of workloads versus the more expensive TSV, dual die package-based 128-gigabyte modules. In data center SSDs, Micron's entire portfolio is now on 176 layer or 232 layer NAND, demonstrating our product and technology leadership. We are in a strong position to serve AI demand for fast storage as these data-intensive applications proliferate. In fiscal Q3, we launched the world's first 200-plus layer NAND data center SSD, and qualification is in progress at multiple key customers to support AI cluster installations. In fact, we have already passed qualification of this product at a critical server OEM partner. We also launched our Extreme endurance data center SSD, which offers superior scalability and affordability versus hard drives. In PCs, we now forecast calendar 2023 PC unit volume to decline by a low double-digit percentage year-over-year with PC units expected to be below the pre-COVID levels last seen in 2019. We are excited about the ongoing industry transition to D5 and are well positioned for it with our strong D5 product lineup. Industry clients D5 mix is expected to cross over from D4 in early calendar 2024. In fiscal Q3, we achieved record quarterly client SSD bit shipments driven by share growth in client SSDs as customers adopted our industry-leading solutions. Our SSD QLC bit shipment mix reached a new record for the third consecutive quarter with growth in both clients and consumer. Last month, we launched crucial T700, the world's fastest Gen 5 PCIe consumer SSD built with our 232 layer NAND. In graphics, industry analysts continue to expect graphics TAM growth CAGR to outpace the broader market supported by applications across client and data center. We expect customer inventories to normalize in calendar Q3. We plan to introduce our next-generation G7 product on our industry-leading 1-beta node in the first half of calendar year 2024. In mobile, we now expect calendar 2023 smartphone unit volumes to be down by a mid-single-digit percentage year-over-year. While units are weaker, we are seeing stronger memory content growth driven by a mix shift toward premium phones and elasticity. We expect sequential growth in fiscal Q4 as customers prepare for upcoming product launches in the back half of calendar 2023. In fiscal Q3, we achieved key mobile customer qualifications on our 1 beta base LP5X and started high-volume revenue shipments to Tier 1 OEMs. In addition, we achieved significant milestones in UFS with the qualification and ramp of a high-capacity UMCP5 featuring 16 gigabyte of DRAM and 512 gigabytes of NAND. We have also started to sample a new UFS4 product based on our latest 232-layer NAND technology, which enables industry-leading performance for flagship handsets. Last, I'll cover the auto and industrial end markets, which represent over 20% of our revenue and contribute more stable revenue and profitability. Micron continues to lead in automotive, which is a key market and growth driver for us. In fiscal Q3, auto revenue reached another quarterly record and grew by a high single-digit percentage year-over-year. We continue to expect growth in auto memory demand for the second half of calendar 2023, driven by easing non-memory semiconductor supply, normalizing customer inventory levels and increasing memory content per vehicle. The industrial market saw early signs of recovery in fiscal Q3. Inventory levels are stabilizing at distribution partners and at the majority of our customers. As a result, we expect an improvement in demand in the second half of calendar 2023. We are excited about our growth prospects in this market as industrial customers continue to adopt and implement IoT, AI and machine learning in the factory. Now turning to industry outlook. Our expectations for calendar 2023 industry bit demand growth has been further reduced to low to mid-single digits in DRAM and to high single digits in NAND, which are well below the expected long-term CAGR of mid-teens percentage range in DRAM and low 20s percentage range in NAND. While the AI-driven demand has been stronger than our expectations 3 months ago, the PC, smartphone and traditional server demand forecasts are now lower. We continue to expect stronger industry bit shipments for DRAM and NAND in the second half of the calendar year, driven by secular content growth and continued improvement in customer inventory. While the industry demand forecast for calendar 2023 is now lower, the significant supply reductions across the industry have started to stabilize the market. We see both DRAM and NAND year-over-year supply growth to be negative for the industry in calendar 2023, as utilization and CapEx cuts across the industry impact supply growth. While supply/demand balance is improving due to the excess inventory, profitability and cash flow will remain extremely challenged for some time. Market recovery can accelerate if there is further reduction in industry production and these cuts are sustained well into calendar 2024. In response to the industry environment, Micron has taken decisive actions to bring our supply back in balance with demand. We expect Micron's year-on-year bit supply growth to be meaningfully negative for DRAM. We also expect to produce fewer NAND bits in calendar 2023 than in calendar 2022. Our fiscal 2023 CapEx plan of $7 billion is down more than 40% from last year, with WFE down more than 50%. We continue to expect fiscal '24 WFE to be down year-on-year. Recently, we have further reduced wafer starts to approach 30% in both DRAM and NAND. We currently expect reduced wafer starts will continue well into calendar 2024, and as we remain focused on managing down our inventories and controlling our supply. I will now turn it over to Mark.Mark J. MurphyThanks, Sanjay. Good afternoon, everyone. Fiscal Q3 results were in line to better than expectations, with revenue coming in above the midpoint of our guidance range and gross margin and EPS exceeding the high end of the range. Total fiscal Q3 revenue was approximately $3.8 billion, up 2% sequentially and down 57% year-over-year. Fiscal Q3 revenue included $72 million from an insurance settlement disclosed at the time we provided guidance. Fiscal Q3 DRAM revenue was $2.7 billion representing 71% of total revenue. DRAM revenue declined 2% sequentially, with bit shipments increasing in the 10 percentage range and prices declining by approximately 10%. Fiscal Q3 NAND revenue was $1 billion, representing 27% of Micron's total revenue. NAND revenue increased 14% sequentially with bit shipments increasing in the upper 30 percentage range and prices declining in the mid-teens percentage range. Now turning to revenue by business unit. Compute and Networking business unit revenue was $1.4 billion, up 1% sequentially. Strong sequential growth in server and graphics revenues was offset by a decline in client. Embedded business unit revenue was $912 million, up 5% sequentially. On a sequential basis, automotive and consumer revenues were strong. Revenue for the mobile business unit was $819 million, down 13% sequentially due to timing of shipments. As Sanjay mentioned, we expect growth in mobile revenues in fiscal Q4. Revenue for the Storage Business Unit was $627 million, up 24% sequentially and driven by increased shipments across most of the portfolio. The consolidated gross margin for fiscal Q3 was negative 16%, improving 15 percentage points sequentially. This result was negatively impacted by approximately $400 million or 11 percentage points of write-downs associated with inventory produced in the quarter. Operating expenses in fiscal Q3 were $866 million, down roughly $50 million sequentially. OpEx benefited from ongoing expense reduction initiatives and gains on sales of certain assets. We had an operating loss of roughly $1.5 billion in fiscal Q3 resulting in an operating margin of negative 39%, improved from negative 56% in the prior quarter. Fiscal Q3 taxes were $102 million, higher than expectations at the time of our guidance driven by onetime discrete items. As mentioned in previous quarters, despite a consolidated loss on a worldwide basis, we still have taxes payable in certain geographies due to taxable income levels reported in those geographies. The non-GAAP loss per share in fiscal Q3 was $1.43, down from a loss per share of $1.91 in the prior quarter, and earnings per share of $2.59 in the prior year. Fiscal Q3 EPS included approximately $0.37 of losses from the impact of the inventory write-down associated with inventory produced in the quarter. Turning to cash flows and capital spending. Our operating cash flows were approximately $24 million. Capital expenditures were $1.4 billion during the quarter. We continue to expect capital expenditures to be approximately $7 billion for the fiscal year. that's near $1 billion in fiscal Q4. Free cash flow was negative $1.4 billion in the quarter and improved from the previous 2 quarters. Our fiscal Q3 ending inventory was $8.2 billion or 168 days. Due to increases in process steps and product complexity, we now target inventory levels of around 120 days, which at present would equate to approximately $6 billion. Our current inventories include strategic stocks of approximately $1 billion over target levels associated with build-ahead of product for cost optimization and risk mitigation. At quarter end, we held cash and investments of $11.4 billion and had total liquidity of $13.9 billion, including our untapped credit facility. We issued $1.5 billion of long-term debt in the quarter. And with part of those proceeds paid down $600 million of our term loan facility resulting in a net increase to debt of $900 million. Our fiscal Q3 ending debt was $13.2 billion. Now turning to our outlook for the fiscal fourth quarter. As mentioned in filings and our comments today, the CAC decision is a headwind to our outlook. We expect the revenue impact to vary by quarter with the impact in fiscal Q4 being less than the quarterly impact in the first half of fiscal 2024. Over time, we have a goal of retaining our global market share in both DRAM and NAND. In fiscal Q4, as the industry demand continues to improve and despite the effects on our business from the CAC decision, we still see record bit shipments. Fiscal Q4 gross margin will be impacted by costs from underutilization, weak pricing levels and product mix. In the current business environment, the gap between our DRAM and NAND profitability is significant, and changes in the mix can drive large variability in gross margins. Our gross margin guidance does not contemplate additional write-downs of inventory. We continue to aggressively manage our operating expenses and remain on track to exit the fiscal year at less than $850 million. Looking beyond fiscal Q4, we expect OpEx to increase over $50 million in fiscal Q1 2024 on R&amp;D program expense timing. And as reductions to employee compensation end. With all these factors in mind, our non-GAAP guidance for fiscal Q4 is as follows: we expect revenue to be $3.9 billion, plus or minus $200 million; gross margin to be in the range of negative 10.5% plus or minus 250 basis points; and operating expenses to be approximately $845 million plus or minus $15 million; we expect tax expenses of approximately $40 million. Based on a share count of approximately 1.1 billion shares, we expect EPS to be a loss of $1.19 plus or minus $0.07. In closing, we continue to act quickly and tenaciously to navigate this downturn, making the investments to maintain our leading capabilities across technology, products and manufacturing while preserving our solid balance sheet. In this environment, we remain sharply focused on improving our profitability and free cash flow. As market conditions improve, we will continue to drive efficiencies to hold on to productivity gains. Despite the impact of this downturn and effects of the CAC decision, we remain confident in our financial model and our ability to deliver long-term profitability, cash flow and shareholder returns. I will now turn it back over to Sanjay.Sanjay MehrotraThank you, Mark. I'm proud of the execution of the Micron team and the progress we've made this quarter. The leadership products we released and qualified [are] strengthening Micron's portfolio across multiple key markets. While there are near-term headwinds, I'm excited about the new product introductions that we have planned for the next several quarters, which will further enable us to leverage the dramatic growth in AI that is ahead of us. I'm confident that this portfolio momentum, combined with our technology capability, manufacturing excellence, financial discipline and excellent customer relationships will position us well for the future. I also want to call attention to Micron's 2023 Sustainability Report, which published yesterday. The report underscores our continued commitment to innovation the environment, our people and the communities where we operate, outlining our progress and escalations across our environmental, social and governance programs. I encourage you to review the full report on Micron's website. Thank you for joining us today. We will now open for questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from the line of C.J. Muse from Evercore ISI.Christopher James MuseI guess first question, with inventory expected to normalize in the coming months quarter, how are you seeing customer purchasing behavior perhaps change given that we're clearly hitting a pricing trough very soon. We'd love to hear kind of how those discussions might be changing.Sanjay MehrotraThanks, CJ, for that question. We, of course, continue to work closely with our customers. And as we said, that customer inventories are improving, except for data center, inventories are close to normal in most of our other end markets. Data center we said by end of this year or somewhat thereafter -- shortly thereafter, data center customer inventories, we expect to improve as well. And we continue to work closely with our customers. Some of the customers definitely interested in some of the longer-term outlook for the business and other customers operate on a month-to-month basis. And overall, of course, we continue to mitigate through some of the impact of the China decision as well. But the value that we are bringing to the customers for our products continues to strengthen, and Micron is very much focused on navigating through the current downturn and working closely with our customers to address their future demand. And as we have said in my remarks that some of the customers, given the low pricing that exists in the industry today, and before prices begin to increase substantially, some of the customers may be looking at purchasing additional volumes at this time. But in general, the trajectory is of continuing improvement in their inventory levels end to end across the supply chain, add the customers directly as well as third parties who may be supplying to the customers. And as you know, inventories at the suppliers are coming down as well.Christopher James MuseVery helpful. If I could just follow up real quickly on HBM3. You guided to meaningful [reps], in fiscal '24. Can you give us a sense of what that means? And over time, what size kind of could that look like for you guys looking out kind of 3, 5 years?Sanjay MehrotraWell, with respect to HBM3, we are very excited about this product. Micron has focused on bringing an industry-leading product and HBM3 product that is in early stages of sampling. And we expect to begin production volume ramp of this product in early 2024 is a product that has significantly higher performance, bandwidth and significantly lower power. In fact, as a product, it is close to a generational leap ahead of anything else that is in the market. We have received strong endorsement for this product in the market, and we expect the volume ramp of this product for us to be rapid, to be steep ramp, and this will bring in our fiscal year 2024 strong revenue growth opportunity for us. So we are very excited about this standout product. It will be a significant growth driver for Micron. And everything that we have done here is, of course, built on our industry-leading 1-beta technology and applying to it, of course, advanced packaging, differentiated packaging and TSV capability. So this is, we believe, going to be a standout product for us. And we expect we target a share with HBM with this kind of an industry-leading product that would be higher than our average DRAM share in the industry as well.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri from UBS.Timothy Michael ArcuriI had 2. Mark, the first one is for you. I was wondering if you can sort of lay out what the fiscal Q4 guidance would have looked like in net of the ban. I know you said that the impact from the ban gets worse actually in the fiscal first half. So is it as simple as maybe fiscal Q4, you had said low double-digit did impact, but it sounds like it's probably not that big in fiscal Q4. So something less than that in fiscal Q4, and then you sort of expand to a number or something in that range in the first half of fiscal 2025 or '24 rather, can you sort of handicap that for us and shape it for us.Mark J. MurphyYes. We had a small impact in very small in Q3. It's a more material impact in Q4. We do expect the impact to increase. However, our actions to mitigate that will help offset the effect. But really, at this time, it's a headwind, but there's -- and that's clear. However, we are taking mitigating actions and it's very uncertain continues to evolve on what the impact will be. And again, the impact that we see in the fourth quarter, it's contemplated in our guidance.Timothy Michael ArcuriGot it. Maybe I'll ask you in the follow-up. But my second question is for Sanjay. So Sanjay, I asked you this last call, too. So you alluded to the smartphone customers at least wanting to kind of get out in front of what they see maybe could be some tightness and maybe they're opportunistically trying to take advantage of pricing being so low. Can you just talk more broadly about what might change in your relationship with your customers coming out of this downturn? I mean, could we be headed toward a situation where maybe the data center customers that pushed you and your peers so far during the downturn that maybe we can talk about LTAs at some point. I know that this is a ways away, given kind of where we are today. But can you just talk about maybe over the past 3 months, when I asked you last time how the tone of the discussion with the data center customers in particular has changed.Sanjay MehrotraWell, our customers, of course, work with us on LTAs. And as we have said, LTAs relate to their forecast for the year, generally. And while some customers may be operating on shorter term or other customers longer term. But generally speaking, they operate on yearly LTAs and LTAs involve supply and demand commitments from the 2 sides. Of course, sometimes with the changing industry environment on either side, on the supply or on the demand side, there can be adjustments made to those LTAs, and we work closely with our customers in those regards. And we have had close relationships with the customers. We have a very strong product momentum. You are particularly inquiring about data center. And let me tell you that our product momentum in data center with strong portfolio of solutions, particularly addressing the growing interest in AI, in data center, generative AI, becoming a big opportunity, and we look at it for 2024 as a big year for AI and for memory and storage and Micron will be well positioned with this product. And these are all parts of our discussions when we address their requirements on their future purchases when we address LTA requirements. And of course, we need the necessary investments related to our production mix in terms of die requirements, in terms of our assembly and test requirements and we really work closely with our customers to help manage these. And just keep in mind that, as I mentioned, that a lot of new product considerations go into the LTAs as well. As well as, of course, the volume and overall demand and supply considerations. So LTAs at the end, really help both the parties. They help us plan our engineering, our product road map, alignment on that, our investments in things such as back-end capacity because products like HBM, product like high-density modules and of course, in the mobile sector, products like MCPs, et cetera, have all different considerations at the back end. And these are the kind of things, the LTAs really help us plan with our customers.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Krish Sankar from TD Cowen.Krish SankarCongrats on the good results. Sanjay, the first question I wanted to ask you was you spoke about AI servers having 6x to 8x more DRAM content and that demand is strong while traditional data center service demand is weak. There's a view that some of these AI servers are replacing over 10 of the DCs, regular DC servers. So I'm just kind of curious how to think about overall DRAM demand as AI grows but probably cannibalizes some of your regular data center server DRAM content. And then I have a follow-up.Sanjay MehrotraSo look, when we look at the overall DRAM demand, the DRAM TAM, of course, the AI is driving growth. Automotive, certainly driving growth. Other end markets, such as we mentioned, mobile and PC in terms of all consumer, in terms of their end demand, has been somewhat lackluster. The AI demand that is driven in data center, whether it is in the enterprise definitely drives healthy trends for memory growth. Yes, enterprise server and some of the data center demand has been recently somewhat impacted by the macro trends, but the trend of AI and more memory is absolutely continuing. And that's what -- when we look at our overall 2023 demand growth and the projections of CAGR that we have ahead of us, we have taken those into account. This is very, very early innings for AI, and AI is really pervasive. It's everywhere in, of course, cloud applications, enterprise server applications, applications such as generative AI would be in enterprises too because due to confidentiality of data, enterprises will be building their own large language models. And as you know, while the enterprise large language models, may not be as large as the large language models you may see in examples such as super clusters, et cetera. But all of them are really trending towards greater number of parameters. Now we are talking about parameters with Generative AI getting into even trillion parameter range, not too long ago. These used to be in 100 millions of range. That requires more memory. So regardless of the applications, whether it is on the enterprise side or on the cloud server side, the memory requirements are continuing to increase. And I'll just point out that 6x to 8x that we have mentioned is the multiple of DRAM requirement in AI server versus standard server. And of course, as we highlighted in the script, there are many compute configurations, such as the super cluster example that we gave you, where the DRAM content that is required is few hundred times higher than a standard server. So really, I think the journey here ahead of us will be very exciting. And when we look at machine-to-machine communication, when we look at opportunities for the virtuous cycle for the ever-increasing data that training applications, that inferencing at scale and various edge applications including automotive are driving the requirements for memory and storage will continue to grow well, and Micron is going to be well positioned with our products. And we consider 2024 to be a big banner year for AI, for memory and storage. And Micron will be well positioned to capture this with our strong portfolio of products from D5 to LP5 to HBM to high-density modules even including graphics.Krish SankarGot it. Got it. Very helpful, Sanjay. And then a follow-up for Mark. You said no inventory write-down in the current quarter expected. And if I remember right, Mark, you also mentioned in the past that inventory write-down (inaudible) your view on pricing 3 quarters out. So is it fair to assume that you're expecting a pricing drop pretty much in this quarter? And is the CAC decision does get really worse that 15% to 25% of your sales gets impacted, is there any more risk of inventory write-down? Or is that agnostic inventory write down?Mark J. MurphyYes. Thanks, Krish. Maybe spend a few minutes just covering because of a very complicated topic with a lot of moving parts. Maybe spend a bit of time on the topic. So our reported gross margin, our outlook, it's a function of many factors, including pricing. The inventory write-downs, which do include or incorporate our forward view of pricing. The effects of utilization, which you heard today, we've increased or reduced our wafer starts further. And then just volumes and associated leverage on [period] costs as discussed in previous quarters, and of course, mix. These factors are continuously changing due to market environment and our actions, and as I've stated before at these lower levels of profitability, our margin forecast and results are more sensitive to slight changes in assumptions such as price. Now given price trends and our current view on pricing and costs, we took a material write-down in the second quarter as we reported $1.4 billion, took another $400 million this quarter. And with these write-downs, we've pulled forward inventory costs, hence lowered the carrying value of on-hand inventories. Yes, as a lower cost inventory clears in the future quarters, we realized more income in those quarters than we would have otherwise without the charge. So as an example, we took this $400 million of additional write-downs in third quarter for inventories produced. And considering our latest views on volume mix, we also realized a benefit of near $300 million from selling through the lower cost inventories impacted by the second quarter write-down. So I do want to call out that it's -- with all the uncertainty, complexity and sensitivity at these profitability levels, our write-down and the benefits that we had in the third quarter, we're not far off what we estimated in our guide. So I think that's a good reflection of our handle of what's happening in the business. Now we've also got underutilization effects, which are creating higher costs and inventories and adding period costs. We project roughly $1.1 billion of underutilization impact in FY '23 associated with the front end. Most of that will impact the P&amp;L this year. Some of it will carry over to next year. But because of the effect of the write-down accounting, less of it will carry over to next year than would have otherwise. Beyond this period of write-down effects, the impact of lower wafer starts between the period cost and the higher cost inventories, the effect is higher single digits on margins then down to mid- and lower single digits on margins as revenues increase. So considering all this, just to give you a sense of profile of margin and in turn, pricing to your question. We said last quarter that we expect -- or as we said last quarter, we expect -- we had a reported second quarter margin to be the trough, and that was driven by the $1.4 billion write-down. With a much lower inventory charge forecasted in the third quarter, which happened, that margin improved about 15 points. And then also, as mentioned last quarter, we said that fourth quarter would be better than third quarter on a lower write-down. And hence, we guided today 5 points better than the third quarter. Again, these estimates are sensitive to pricing changes. And -- but in our current view, we expect a gradual improvement on margin to continue sequentially on a reported basis. Now if you take our non-GAAP third quarter gross margin of negative 16%, and we were to strip out the write-down effects in third quarter, both the write-down portion and the realized benefit. And also to normalize, you strip out the insurance settlement, which we had in the third quarter, we would still be -- those 2 things largely offset. So we'd be still at about 16% negative gross margin. So again, over 100 net inventory effects, the $400 million write down less the $300 million realized benefit and then the roughly the same over 100 insurance settlement. So -- and this is a function of the pricing environment, which we, I think, properly captured in our guide. Now that adjusted 16 -- or that adjusted margin, 16% is down clearly versus the adjusted second quarter margin, which, as I recall, is about 7%, so down 23 points. So under this adjusted view, we would trough on gross margin over the next few quarters, and then we would improve off these low levels through FY '24. So this is a profile that's consistent with what we've discussed before, though the levels are a bit lower and a bit delayed. And so hopefully, that provide you some color both on how we see pricing and how we see gross margin playing out with all the puts and takes.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur from JPMorgan.Harlan L. SurI guess as a follow-up to that, Mark, on your gross margin guidance for the fourth quarter. I know there are no inventory write-downs, but is it contemplating a step-up in underutilization charges or period costs associated with underutilization charges sequentially? And because you cut your wafer starts another 5 percentage points right to 30% and if you could maybe quantify that step-up in underutilization charges? And then as a follow-up, is the incremental 5% cut in utilization is primarily a result of the CAC restrictions?Mark J. MurphyIt is not. It's more of an industry dynamic and our intent to get supply discipline in the market. Supply needs to come out of the market given inventory levels, and that's the principal driver. As far as the effects of utilization, it is already incorporated in this guide. The period costs in the fourth quarter are about $200 million. And again, they're contemplated in the guidance.OperatorAnd our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava from BMO Capital Markets.Ambrish SrivastavaI want to come back to the gross margin. When you had given the guidance for this quarter, you were -- you had walked us through in detail. And you had said that stripping out all the adjustments and the industry write-down, 3Q would be at 7.5%. Am I reading this right that now you stripped out as negative 16%, right? So it's much worse than what you were thinking?Mark J. MurphyNo, I don't think it's much worse than what you're thinking. If you strip out just the underutilization effects, but you keep in the insurance settlement, you're close to what we said, sort of that 7%, 8%. So that you need to consider. We had said that was in there.Ambrish SrivastavaOkay. Got it. And then a follow-up, either for you or for Sanjay. On the 15% round number, 15% of bit loss, share loss in China. How do you recoup that? Is that based on the assumption that bit growth or bit supply will be constrained? And so if the other 2 suppliers are able to meet the China demand, they'll leave some demand out here in other regions for you to basically go after? or Is there a pricing element to that? I'm just not make sure I understand how you get that.Sanjay MehrotraI will take that. So what we have said is that approximately 50% of our business in China is at risk of getting impacted. And of course, we are focused on mitigating any share loss with CIIOs or as a result of CAC decision, with those customers -- global customers who are not impacted by CAC decision. So keep in mind that our share in DRAM is approximately 23% and our share in NAND is approximately 12%. So obviously, we have opportunities to gain share with other customers. And this is what we are focused on. It will take some time, and the CAC decision can -- I mean, as we have said, it is hurting our business. It is slowing our recovery. It can result in quarter-to-quarter variations as well. But over longer term, our target is to maintain our share. So while near term, CAC decision is challenging. Longer term, we will work with customers who are not impacted. Our global customers who are not impacted by CAC decision to increase our share. And we have a long history of working with our customers. We have brought tremendous value of our innovation, our supply, our product portfolio supporting their innovation and road maps in the marketplace. Our customers want to see a strong Micron. Our strategy of keeping our target share consistent over longer term with our current share is understood by our customers because, again, they want to see a strong Micron. So they are supportive of this. And we will continue to work with our customers. And of course, as we bring value to our customers with our products and our product portfolio, we will focus on ROI on our investments, and we'll certainly focus on improving the profitability of our business from current levels as well. So we will, of course, keep profitability in mind. And again, it's important that Micron is a strong partner to our customers. And I think customers understand that multiple strong players in the industry is a benefit for multiple reasons to our customer ecosystem.OperatorAnd our final question for today comes from the line of Tom O'Malley from Barclays.Thomas James O'MalleyRecently, we've been picking up that there is a change in some of the A series where you're starting to see some HBM2E ease just given the fact that there's limited capacity of HBM3. I guess part 1 is, are you seeing an ability to service that market today? And then the second part of the question is you're saying that AI servers see about 6 to 8x DRAM content I assume that contemplates the HBM, but you guys are talking about some AI tailwinds today when you're really not servicing that market as much. So could you talk about what you're seeing ex-HBM as the multiplier effect on DRAM today, just so we can get a picture of how you guys are seeing the improvement in data center what they have today ex that product. That would be really helpful.Sanjay MehrotraSo certainly, we have had HBM2E product in the marketplace that actually gave us strong experience in bringing up our technology and production capability with HBM. The market, as I mentioned, is -- has shifted is shifting to HBM3 and Micron's HBM3+ product, which I called as a generational leap ahead of anything in the industry is going to position us well as we bring that into volume production during the course of our fiscal year '24, starting early part of calendar '24, contributing to several hundred million dollars of revenue opportunity over time. And with respect to AI part of the market, I want to be very clear that, yes, with respect to high-density modules and with respect to high bandwidth, HBM3 solutions. That part of the market is growing this year, and it's an opportunity that we want to capture, and I believe that we'll be well positioned to capture, as I mentioned, that we will be targeting share in HBM with our absolute industry-leading product that's higher than our DRAM industry average share. So -- but it's important to understand is that AI is being served not only by HBM or high-density DRAM modules, but it is also being served by D5 memory and by LP DRAM as well. And this is where with the D5 and LP DRAM products, we gave you some examples in our script as well, a large amount of LP DRAM being used in industry-leading high-performance compute platforms. In fact, the 144 terabytes that we mentioned in DGX, GH 200, about 122 terabytes of that is LP DRAM. And Micron is very well positioned with a differentiated solution of our LP DRAM out there today. So I think it's important to understand that the AI server market is made up of HBM. It's made up of high-density DRAM modules includes -- it also is made up of DDR5, LP5 and some element of [graphics] memory as well. So we do have a broad portfolio. And in 2024 with HBM and high-density DRAM modules getting into production, I really believe we'll be extremely well positioned to capture the growing opportunity in AI. And 75% of DRAM on AI servers today is DDDR5. And as I emphasized, and as I'm sure you well know, we participate very well in D5. In fact, we led the industry with our D5 products, again, built on 1-beta technology here.OperatorThis does conclude the question-and-answer session as well as today's program. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for your participation. You may now disconnect. Good day.]"
301,cb44d796-35fa-31db-a7b0-002bf8cf0171,HAS,2023-06-29,Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) Is Paying Out A Dividend Of $0.70,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hasbro-nasdaq-paying-dividend-0-191016428.html,1687979416,STORY,['HAS'],"[Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.70 per share on the 15th of August. This means the annual payment is 4.5% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Hasbro Hasbro's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageWe like to see robust dividend yields, but that doesn't matter if the payment isn't sustainable. Based on the last payment, the company wasn't making enough to cover what it was paying to shareholders. Without profits and cash flows increasing, it would be difficult for the company to continue paying the dividend at this level.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If recent patterns in the dividend continue, we could see the payout ratio reaching 47% which is fairly sustainable.historic-dividendHasbro Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.44 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.80. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 6.9% over that duration. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained.Dividend Growth Potential Is ShakyInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Unfortunately things aren't as good as they seem. Hasbro's EPS has fallen by approximately 13% per year during the past five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built.Hasbro's Dividend Doesn't Look SustainableOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. We can't deny that the payments have been very stable, but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio. We don't think Hasbro is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

304,327d6c31-278b-318c-bbe1-d2721d3c67d8,TRIP,2023-06-29,Tripadvisor Tests Instant Book (Again),Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tripadvisor-tests-instant-book-again-171223659.html,1687972343,STORY,"['TRIP', 'EXPE', 'BKNG', 'COF']","[This story began with a promotion featured in an email from my credit card company, Capital One, and it took me aback: “Save up to 30% off on your Instant Book hotel with Tripadvisor.”WHAT?If you aren’t an online travel nerd, or don’t work in the industry, you may not understand my shock, but many of you who read this column will “get it” right away.Capital One cardholders can earn 10% cash back on this offer when booking an Instant Book hotel on Tripadvisor. That means they can book the hotel right on Tripadvisor.com or its apps. Source: Capital OneAlthough it may have appeared sporadically over the years, Tripadvisor largely abandoned Instant Book in 2017, and the strategy reversal was a big deal at the time.Why?When Tripadvisor markets hotels, it largely does so as a metasearch site. In metasearch, online travel agencies and hotels bid to list their hotel rates on Tripadvisor, and have to pay a pre-determined cost per click when consumers select them and get redirected to their websites for booking.But with Instant Book six or seven years ago, Tripadvisor was trying to be much more like an online travel agency in that travelers could book the hotel without having to leave the Tripadvisor platform.At the time, the Instant Book initiative was a key strategy plank for Tripadvisor, but the hotel industry and some online travel players didn’t adopt it in a big way. On the one hand, some hotels welcomed the idea of Tripadvisor becoming more powerful as a marketing platform to blunt the power of Google, Expedia and Booking.com. On the other hand, many hotels and online travel agencies wanted consumers to visit their platforms directly without having to rely on a third party like Tripadvisor.Tripadvisor’s abandonment of Instant Book in 2017 landed with a thud.But now, under CEO Matt Goldberg, who took up his post last year, replacing Steve Kaufer, Tripadvisor is resurrecting Instant Book, or at least testing another go-round, although there are some notable twists.Story continuesSource: TripadvisorIn this prominently placed search result for Library Hotel in New York City on Tripadvisor this morning, the Instant Book feature is the one from Tripadvisor itself ($472), as opposed to offers from Expedia.com ($472), Priceline ($524), and Hotels.com ($472).One of the advantages to travelers — just like it was in the previous Instant Book incarnation — is that if they choose the Instant Book offer from Tripadvisor itself, they can complete the booking right there. If they choose Expedia, Priceline or Hotels.com, they would first be redirected to those websites to search some more before completing a booking.It’s Actually an Expedia PartnershipFor the uninitiated in the complexities of online travel, this next statement may be mind-boggling. If you click Book &amp; Get Rewards, then on the next page, where you insert your name and credit card details, you’ll learn that this particular Tripadvisor Instant Book deal actually comes through a partnership with Expedia.If travelers complete the booking on Tripadvisor, the booking details will be available on Tripadvisor, but Expedia will be the merchant of record on their credit cards, send the email confirmations, and handle customer service. Tripadvisor is not in the customer service business for these sorts of things.This was how it worked in the older versions of Tripadvisor Instant Book, as well.But here are what appears to be a couple of twists in this new test. Most of the Instant Book reservations several years ago required travelers to pay immediately instead of when they arrive at the hotel. In the Library Hotels example, consumers wouldn’t have to pay anything at the time of booking, could cancel without penalty by July 19 for a July 26-28 reservation, and would only have to shell out some money when they arrived for their stays.Another new element in this Tripadvisor-Expedia partnership for Instant Book is that Tripadvisor stated that the booking would be eligible for rewards (from credit card companies like Capital One).In the world of online travel, where companies are constantly testing what works best to get consumers to book, this Instant Book listing could vanish before I finish writing this sentence. Or Tripadvisor might resurrect it for real.To be determined.Tripadvisor downplayed the Instant Book appearance.“This isn’t a strategic shift, but just a recent example of a partnership model that we’ve operated for years,” said spokesperson Duncan Skehens. “We regularly work with affiliate partners in this capacity in the U.S., as it offers a reliable way to accurately track and attribute campaign performance. And, while nothing has changed from a wider strategic perspective, we’ll continue to focus on and expand our work with affiliate partners.”What it does say about the new Tripadvisor regime is that the company has a lot of things on the table and is willing to test and learn to see what sticks.   Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

(Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)The Teamsters union said Wednesday that it has demanded that UPS Inc. present its last, best and final contractual offer no later than Friday.The ratcheting up of hostilities comes one day after the Teamsters gave UPS (NYSE: UPS) one week to submit an economic proposal that was superior to the one the Teamsters called “appalling.”  The company’s initial proposal offered small pay raises and cuts to traditional cost-of-living adjustments, the union said.A last, best and final offer (LBFO) is a formal offer that one side — usually the employer — submits to the other for an agreement. It is supposed to include all compromises that the offering party is willing to make, but that is not always the case. The LBFO is often submitted to union members for their vote to reject it or accept it.The Teamsters met with UPS negotiators late into Tuesday night over Article 34 of the union’s National Master Agreement, governing health and welfare and pension benefits for members. Despite early progress, UPS attempted to “move the goalposts at the 11th hour and withhold any additional benefits from the Teamsters, seeking concessionary language instead,” the union said. The Teamsters did not provide any details.When the Teamsters walked away from the table, UPS agreed to resume negotiations Wednesday. When corporate executives showed up, they only resubmitted the same proposal for worker concessions under Article 34, the union said.“The largest single-employer strike in American history now appears inevitable,” said Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien. “Executives at UPS, some of whom get tens of millions of dollars a year, do not care about the hundreds of thousands of American workers who make this company run. They don’t care about our members’ families. UPS doesn’t want to pay up. Their actions and insults at the bargaining table have proven they are just another corporation that wants to keep all the money at the top. Working people who bust their asses every single day do not matter, not to UPS.”Story continues“Last week, we provided our initial economic proposal. This week we followed with a significantly amended proposal to address key demands from the Teamsters,” UPS said in a statement. Reaching consensus requires time and serious, detailed discussion, but it also requires give-and-take from both sides. “The current contract expires July 31, and union leaders have warned that they will strike Aug. 1 without a contract. Teamsters nationwide authorized a strike this month by 97% should UPS fail to come to terms on a new contract. The strike authorization vote was expected.“We have an economy today that is reliant on parcel delivery and no one in the game handles more packages per day or provides better service than Teamsters at UPS. Our members are fighting for a post-pandemic agreement that honors the sacrifices they made to keep this country moving during the last several years,” said Teamsters General Secretary-Treasurer Fred Zuckerman. “Time has run out for UPS to give workers that honorable contract. “The post Teamsters demand UPS present last, best, final offer by Friday appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. That's why when we briefly looked at United Parcel Service's (NYSE:UPS) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on United Parcel Service is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.23 = US$13b ÷ (US$72b - US$16b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, United Parcel Service has an ROCE of 23%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Logistics industry average of 12%. View our latest analysis for United Parcel Service roceIn the above chart we have measured United Parcel Service's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering United Parcel Service here  for free.How Are Returns Trending?It's hard not to be impressed by United Parcel Service's returns on capital. The company has consistently earned 23% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 68% in that time. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If United Parcel Service can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.The Bottom Line On United Parcel Service's ROCEIn short, we'd argue United Parcel Service has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 93% return if they held over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.Story continuesOne more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing United Parcel Service that you might find interesting.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Recently, the company announced a partnership with ClinVar.DownsidesQ1 Negatives: In the first quarter, Myriad Genetics registered a gross margin contraction and an operating loss due to mounting costs and expenses, which is concerning. Adjusted operating expenses for the quarter reflected investments in sales and marketing programs, technology, R&amp;D, additional operating expenses from Gateway Genomics and inflationary pressures.Increasing Competition: Per management, MYGN expects competition to intensify in its current fields with recently observed advancements in technology. In our opinion, competitive headwinds might push down the prices of the high-priced tests provided by Myriad Genetics. This might deter margin improvement going forward.Estimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MYGN’s 2023 loss per share has remained constant at 33 cents in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $738.9 million. This suggests an 8.92% rise from the year-ago reported number.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc.

However, the company's financials look a bit inconsistent and market outcomes are ultimately driven by long-term fundamentals, meaning that the stock could head in either direction. Specifically, we decided to study Boston Scientific's  ROE in this article.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Boston Scientific How To Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Boston Scientific is:5.0% = US$902m ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.05 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Boston Scientific's Earnings Growth And 5.0% ROEOn the face of it, Boston Scientific's ROE is not much to talk about. A quick further study shows that the company's ROE doesn't compare favorably to the industry average of 9.8% either. Therefore, it might not be wrong to say that the five year net income decline of 11% seen by Boston Scientific was probably the result of it having a lower ROE. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. For example, it is possible that the business has allocated capital poorly or that the company has a very high payout ratio.Story continuesSo, as a next step, we compared Boston Scientific's performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 10% over the last few years.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Boston Scientific's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Boston Scientific Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Boston Scientific doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which doesn't explain why the company's earnings have shrunk if it is retaining all of its profits. So there could be some other explanations in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Boston Scientific can be open to many interpretations. Even though it appears to be retaining most of its profits, given the low ROE, investors may not be benefitting from all that reinvestment after all. The low earnings growth suggests our theory correct. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

SRDX has been gaining from its solid prospects in the thrombectomy business over the past few months. The optimism led by a solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 performance and its consistent efforts to boost research and development (R&amp;D) are expected to contribute further. Yet, concerns related to reliance on third parties and data security threats persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has lost 18.6% compared with the 23.3% decline of the industry. The S&amp;P 500 has witnessed 14.6% growth in the said time frame.The renowned medical device and in-vitro diagnostics technology provider has a market capitalization of $424.8 million. Surmodics projects 44.3% growth for fiscal 2024, expecting to maintain its strong performance. SRDX’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average earnings surprise being 21.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Consistent Efforts to Boost R&amp;D: Surmodics’ solid efforts to improve its R&amp;D stature have been a key growth driver, which raises our optimism. The company’s whole product solutions pipeline and sirolimus-based below-the-knee drug-coated balloon program deserve mention. Surmodics has been making progress using its internally developed .014 balloon platform.On its second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call in April, Surmodics’ management stated that the company has begun limited market evaluations for the Pounce Venous Thrombectomy system and Sublime Radial Access microcatheter.Thrombectomy Prospects Bright: Surmodics’ aim to leverage its proprietary Pounce thrombectomy platform technology to develop products raises our optimism. In June, the company received the FDA’s approval for the SurVeil drug-coated balloon. The same month, Surmodics received the FDA’s 510(k) clearance for its Pounce LP (Low Profile) Thrombectomy System.Strong Q2 Results: Surmodics’ better-than-expected results in second-quarter fiscal 2023 buoy optimism about the stock. The company registered a solid uptick in the overall top line. It also saw robust revenues from its Medical Device segment, as well as from its Product sales, and Research, development and other revenues. During the quarter, Surmodics witnessed strong contributions from sales of its Pounce and Sublime products, indicating their continued solid demand.Story continuesDownsidesReliance on Third Parties: A principal element of Surmodics’ business strategy is to enter into licensing arrangements with medical devices and other companies that manufacture products incorporating its technologies. The revenues it derives from such arrangements depend upon its ability or its licensees’ ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for, market and sell products incorporating Surmodics’ technologies. Its failure or the failure of its licensees to meet these requirements could have a material adverse effect on Surmodics’ business.Data Security Threats: Surmodics collects and stores sensitive data, including its proprietary business information, on its networks. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to its operations and business strategy. Despite Surmodics’ security measures, its information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers, resulting from employee error or other disruptions.Estimate TrendSurmodics is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2023. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its loss per share has narrowed from $1.93 to $1.85.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $26.9 million, suggesting an 8.1% improvement from the year-ago reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

It is seeking to put in place a new set of higher capital requirements, known as Basel 3, that will force some to hold greater buffers against losses.These tougher rules were already in the works before the collapse of several regional US banks in the spring. In the wake of those troubles, regulators made it clear that they wanted to make sure their new approach applied to institutions similar in size to First Republic or a Silicon Valley Bank. Both had more than $200 billion in assets at the time of their failures.Powell said last week he does not expect smaller community banks to be subject to the higher capital requirements, which are expected to be proposed sometime this summer. Institutions with at least $100 billion in assets may have to comply.Powell was asked repeatedly by Republicans on Capitol Hill last week about the risks of imposing higher capital requirements and how much capital is too much capital. The Fed chair acknowledged that higher requirements trade-off balancing a more stable banking system against the potential for less lending.Federal Reserve Board Chairman Jerome Powell testifies during a hearing before Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee at Dirksen Senate Office Building on June 22, 2023 on Capitol Hill in Washington, DC. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images) (Alex Wong via Getty Images)“Much will depend on getting the specifics right, and we should bear in mind that there are always trade-offs in any financial regulation,” Powell said Thursday. “In addition, the US has benefited from its rich, multi-tiered banking ecosystem, and that diversity should be preserved.”Powell said the banking system is much stronger as a result of the capital requirements and safeguards built around the largest banks since the financial crisis in 2008.Story continues“The events of the past couple of months would have been much more difficult to manage had the largest banks been undercapitalized or illiquid,” he said.Powell’s observations come after the Fed released the results of its annual stress tests on Wednesday. These showed that all 23 US banks required to undergo the test could continue lending to households and businesses during a hypothetical severe recession. They had capital levels equivalent to more than 10% in aggregate, well above the 4.5% buffer the central bank requires.“The bank runs and failures in 2023, however, were painful reminders that we cannot predict all of the stresses that will inevitably come with time and chance,” Powell said Thursday. “We therefore must not grow complacent about the financial system’s resilience.”]"

329,327d6c31-278b-318c-bbe1-d2721d3c67d8,COF,2023-06-29,Tripadvisor Tests Instant Book (Again),Skift,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tripadvisor-tests-instant-book-again-171223659.html,1687972343,STORY,"['TRIP', 'EXPE', 'BKNG', 'COF']","[This story began with a promotion featured in an email from my credit card company, Capital One, and it took me aback: “Save up to 30% off on your Instant Book hotel with Tripadvisor.”WHAT?If you aren’t an online travel nerd, or don’t work in the industry, you may not understand my shock, but many of you who read this column will “get it” right away.Capital One cardholders can earn 10% cash back on this offer when booking an Instant Book hotel on Tripadvisor. That means they can book the hotel right on Tripadvisor.com or its apps. Source: Capital OneAlthough it may have appeared sporadically over the years, Tripadvisor largely abandoned Instant Book in 2017, and the strategy reversal was a big deal at the time.Why?When Tripadvisor markets hotels, it largely does so as a metasearch site. In metasearch, online travel agencies and hotels bid to list their hotel rates on Tripadvisor, and have to pay a pre-determined cost per click when consumers select them and get redirected to their websites for booking.But with Instant Book six or seven years ago, Tripadvisor was trying to be much more like an online travel agency in that travelers could book the hotel without having to leave the Tripadvisor platform.At the time, the Instant Book initiative was a key strategy plank for Tripadvisor, but the hotel industry and some online travel players didn’t adopt it in a big way. On the one hand, some hotels welcomed the idea of Tripadvisor becoming more powerful as a marketing platform to blunt the power of Google, Expedia and Booking.com. On the other hand, many hotels and online travel agencies wanted consumers to visit their platforms directly without having to rely on a third party like Tripadvisor.Tripadvisor’s abandonment of Instant Book in 2017 landed with a thud.But now, under CEO Matt Goldberg, who took up his post last year, replacing Steve Kaufer, Tripadvisor is resurrecting Instant Book, or at least testing another go-round, although there are some notable twists.Story continuesSource: TripadvisorIn this prominently placed search result for Library Hotel in New York City on Tripadvisor this morning, the Instant Book feature is the one from Tripadvisor itself ($472), as opposed to offers from Expedia.com ($472), Priceline ($524), and Hotels.com ($472).One of the advantages to travelers — just like it was in the previous Instant Book incarnation — is that if they choose the Instant Book offer from Tripadvisor itself, they can complete the booking right there. If they choose Expedia, Priceline or Hotels.com, they would first be redirected to those websites to search some more before completing a booking.It’s Actually an Expedia PartnershipFor the uninitiated in the complexities of online travel, this next statement may be mind-boggling. If you click Book &amp; Get Rewards, then on the next page, where you insert your name and credit card details, you’ll learn that this particular Tripadvisor Instant Book deal actually comes through a partnership with Expedia.If travelers complete the booking on Tripadvisor, the booking details will be available on Tripadvisor, but Expedia will be the merchant of record on their credit cards, send the email confirmations, and handle customer service. Tripadvisor is not in the customer service business for these sorts of things.This was how it worked in the older versions of Tripadvisor Instant Book, as well.But here are what appears to be a couple of twists in this new test. Most of the Instant Book reservations several years ago required travelers to pay immediately instead of when they arrive at the hotel. In the Library Hotels example, consumers wouldn’t have to pay anything at the time of booking, could cancel without penalty by July 19 for a July 26-28 reservation, and would only have to shell out some money when they arrived for their stays.Another new element in this Tripadvisor-Expedia partnership for Instant Book is that Tripadvisor stated that the booking would be eligible for rewards (from credit card companies like Capital One).In the world of online travel, where companies are constantly testing what works best to get consumers to book, this Instant Book listing could vanish before I finish writing this sentence. Or Tripadvisor might resurrect it for real.To be determined.Tripadvisor downplayed the Instant Book appearance.“This isn’t a strategic shift, but just a recent example of a partnership model that we’ve operated for years,” said spokesperson Duncan Skehens. “We regularly work with affiliate partners in this capacity in the U.S., as it offers a reliable way to accurately track and attribute campaign performance. And, while nothing has changed from a wider strategic perspective, we’ll continue to focus on and expand our work with affiliate partners.”What it does say about the new Tripadvisor regime is that the company has a lot of things on the table and is willing to test and learn to see what sticks.   Get breaking travel news and exclusive hotel, airline, and tourism research and insights at Skift.com.]"

He also has hailed work with unions to improve safety — something labor leaders say Norfolk Southern hasn’t done much of since it began overhauling operations in 2019.“That interaction and that engagement with our craft colleagues is really important to me,” Shaw said in an interview with The Associated Press at the railroad's Atlanta headquarters last week, a day before federal hearings on the East Palestine derailment began. “I need all 20,000 voices at Norfolk Southern pushing for safety. And that’s what you’re going to see.”In the interview, Shaw reiterated many of his same safety promises, and offered more details about his plans, but many critics remain skeptical because they haven't seen fundamental changes. And regulators and members of Congress say Norfolk Southern should be doing more than it has announced.SCRUTINY OVER SAFETYThe railroad — and the entire industry — is under intense watch because chemicals spilled in the East Palestine derailment, and because thousands of people had to evacuate when officials blew open cars of vinyl chloride to burn it and prevent cars from exploding. Several other industry derailments reinforced concerns.East Palestine highlights that even though freight railroads are regarded as the safest way to ship cargo over land, just one derailment can be disastrous.The railroad has spent months removing contaminated water and soil, and the cleanup continues. Meanwhile, residents worry about potential long-term harm, though health officials insist the air and water are safe.Story continuesShaw believes “we’re a safe railroad” because Norfolk Southern had its fewest derailments and injuries last year in more than a decade. But some other Federal Railroad Association measures have worsened, like the rates of total accidents and railyard accidents.An FRA report on Norfolk Southern’s safety culture is expected soon, and the National Transportation Safety Board continues to examine its safety practices as it investigates what caused the Ohio derailment.WORKER CONCERNSThe International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers union was the only of Norfolk Southern’s 13 unions that didn't sign a letter last month promising to cooperate to improve safety. It doesn't think Shaw's pronouncements have translated into meaningful changes and worries new employees and those returning from furloughs might not have enough safety training.“Mr. Shaw comes across to me as kind of as that used car salesman trying really hard to sell Norfolk Southern and saying all this great stuff,"" said James Orwan, a Machinist Union general chairman on Norfolk Southern.One significant change his locomotive mechanics have seen is the resumption of safety meetings at the start of shifts, Orwan said, but the railroad is so understaffed that it can't do some things managers talk about.Shaw said he has met with that union and is glad officials feel comfortable raising concerns. And Shaw knows “you judge me by the results,” but he’s convinced the railroad is “making a lot of progress.”Even low-level managers now get bonuses for improving safety and service — not just for keeping the trains moving.Norfolk Southern has hired a nuclear power expert, Atkins Nuclear Secured, to advise on its safety culture.“You know, the Navy nuclear program is the gold standard in safety of all of industry,"" said Shaw, who was impressed by the safety focus during his first professional job helping to install nuclear reactors in Navy ships. “And I wanted that DNA because Norfolk Southern is going to be the gold standard of safety in the rail industry.”But some unions bristle — particularly because Atkins is unfamiliar with railroads.“Hiring outside consultants may sound good to investors, but the experts are working every day in the cab of the engine,” said Eddie Hall, president of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen.OPERATIONS AND HIRINGUnions say the new lean operating model that Norfolk Southern and the other major freight railroads are using — known as “precision-scheduled railroading” — has made the industry more dangerous because deep workforce cuts make it hard to keep up with jobs and preventative maintenance. And workers say an increasing reliance on longer trains is a safety concern.Examples cited most often by unions, including at Friday's NTSB hearing, are that inspectors who used to have several minutes to check each car are pressured to do so in one minute or less, and that Norfolk Southern relies too much on abbreviated inspections by train crews instead of detailed ones by experts.But Shaw said Norfolk Southern’s safety record has improved since it started using precision scheduled railroading in 2019. The model's core concepts are something “any industrial company would fully support,"" he said — while noting that he has also tempered his railroad’s approach to that model in the past year to focus more on long-term revenue growth and less on short-term cost-cutting.And Norfolk Southern, he said, is backing away from rushing inspections.“My expectation is, is that we will not put an unsafe railcar out onto our network,"" Shaw said. “In the past, we've had guidelines on inspection times. We've removed those recently.”Norfolk Southern won't be quick to lay off workers when the economy slows, so it can handle the eventual resurgence in demand, Shaw said. The railroad has hired aggressively after cutting too deeply during the pandemic, although it remains more than 1,500 below pre-pandemic levels.“No company is going to grow over time if it provides a lousy product to its customers every three years,” Shaw said.DERAILMENT AFTERMATHSteps like adding more trackside detectors — devices that check indicators like wheel-bearing temperatures — after the East Palestine derailment seemed obvious, given that the NTSB has said that an overheating bearing that triggered a warning likely caused the crash.Norfolk Southern has also pledged over $62 million to help East Palestine recover. Resident Misti Allison, who hosted Shaw at her home for lunch after she testified alongside him at a congressional hearing, said things like $25 million to improve East Palestine’s parks are welcome but tangential.“While I think that he is doing a good job, they are doing it in a way to benefit Norfolk Southern and not necessarily the priorities of the residents,” Allison said. “I wish Norfolk Southern’s priorities would be about the health and safety of the families.""Shaw said he thinks a lot of the reforms proposed in Congress since the derailment, like strengthening tank car standards and expanding hazmat training, make sense and won’t burden railroads.But, he said, he doesn’t think FRA statistics link train length and derailments or crew size and safety, so he doesn’t believe Congress or states should regulate those. And he’s leery of some proposed standards for trackside detectors in the bill because, Shaw said, they might lock his railroad into current technology instead of future, better sensors.]"

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Having said that, from a first glance at Coca-Cola Europacific Partners (AMS:CCEP) we aren't jumping out of our chairs at how returns are trending, but let's have a deeper look.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.098 = €2.1b ÷ (€29b - €7.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).Therefore, Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has an ROCE of 9.8%. On its own that's a low return on capital but it's in line with the industry's average returns of 9.7%. See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' ROCE Trending?The returns on capital haven't changed much for Coca-Cola Europacific Partners in recent years. The company has employed 48% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 9.8%. Given the company has increased the amount of capital employed, it appears the investments that have been made simply don't provide a high return on capital.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Coca-Cola Europacific Partners' ROCELong story short, while Coca-Cola Europacific Partners has been reinvesting its capital, the returns that it's generating haven't increased. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 94% over the last five years. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.If you'd like to know about the risks facing Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(CULP) came out with a quarterly loss of $0.38 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of $0.45. This compares to loss of $0.49 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 15.56%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this company would post a loss of $0.74 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.68, delivering a surprise of 8.11%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Culp, Inc. , which belongs to the Zacks Textile - Home Furnishing industry, posted revenues of $61.43 million for the quarter ended April 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.69%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $56.94 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Culp, Inc. Shares have added about 3.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 14%.What's Next for Culp, Inc.While Culp, Inc. Has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Culp, Inc. Unfavorable.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Last year was challenging for the overall stock market and particularly for growth stocks. On the other hand, dividend indexes and portfolios focused on dividends performed relatively well. Some even managed to achieve a small gain during that period. This year, the stock market has experienced a shift in investing style as growth stocks are reasserting their dominance over dividend stocks. However, this does not indicate that dividend stocks have lost their appeal as income generation and compounding growth continue to be the prime focus of investors this year as well.Evaluating the growth rate of dividends over multiple years can provide an understanding of the contribution of dividend stocks to long-term wealth creation. Increasing dividends mean shareholders receive larger cash payments over time. This growing income stream can be particularly beneficial for individuals who rely on dividend income for living expenses or as a source of regular cash flow. Moreover, companies that raise their payouts regularly have outperformed the market historically. According to a report by T. Rowe Price, the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index, which tracks the performance of companies with 25 consecutive years of dividend increases, has outperformed the S&amp;P 500 by over 75% since 1989. Some of the best long-term stocks in this regard are Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV).Also read: 14 Best Stocks for Long Term GrowthAnalysts have expressed a positive view of dividend stocks and exchange-traded funds in 2023 because of their long-term impact on returns. They believe that dividend funds are a safer choice because they invest in companies that have strong financial positions and healthy cash flows. These factors make them more likely to withstand economic downturns and remain resilient. Christopher Huemmer, senior vice president at FlexShares Exchange Traded Funds, highlighted the significance of dividend stocks while speaking with Reuters in April. He said:Story continues""Though we have experienced periods where the capital appreciation of a stock’s price has dwarfed the return from dividend income, the power of dividends should not be overlooked as a crucial component of equity performance.""He further stated:""In volatile markets, dividends can act like the keel of a sailboat, providing a level of stable return in choppy seas.""The historical evidence consistently supports the substantial contribution of dividend stocks to overall market returns. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we reported Hartford Fund’s data, which showed that dividend income represented 41% of the S&amp;P 500’s total return on average from 1930 to 2022. We also reported that from 2000 to 2009, the S&amp;P 500 experienced negative returns due to the dot-com bubble burst in March 2000. Despite this, dividends provided a positive annualized return of 1.8% during that period. The fact that dividend income has accounted for a considerable portion of the S&amp;P 500's total return emphasizes the significance of dividends for long-term investors, who prioritize generating regular cash flow from their investments.12 Best Long-Term Dividend Stocks To Buy NowPhoto by Austin Distel on UnsplashOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q1 2023 and selected companies that have raised their dividends for 15 consecutive years or more.

Martin, chairman and chief executive officer of Sempra. ""I am honored to celebrate this significant milestone in partnership with the thousands of talented employees across Sempra's family of companies who share a common mission and commitment to a high-performance culture.""To commemorate Sempra's 25th anniversary, company leadership participated in the ringing of the New York Stock Exchange opening bell in New York this week, initiating company-wide celebrations from coast to coast.Sempra was formed on June 29, 1998, from a merger between two century-old utilities: Pacific Enterprises and Enova Corporation, the parent companies of Southern California Gas Co. and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co., respectively. Since then, Sempra has grown into one of the leading North American energy infrastructure companies with service to nearly 40 million consumers in California, Texas and Mexico. The company has developed a portfolio of businesses over the last two and a half decades comprised of top-tier utilities and long-term contracted energy infrastructure assets. Sempra's disciplined capital allocation approach and sustained performance has delivered long-term value for its shareholders, resulting in a total shareholder return of roughly 1,200% from 1998 through 2022. During that same period, the company's market capitalization increased 810% from $6 billion in 1998 to nearly $50 billion at the end of 2022.Story continuesToday, Sempra's three growth platforms — Sempra California, Sempra Texas and Sempra Infrastructure — are building modern infrastructure to deliver electricity and cleaner fuels to some of North America's leading economies and globally. Together, these growth platforms serve a common purpose of helping to meet the world's expanding decarbonization and energy security goals. The company is currently executing a record $40 billion capital plan for 2023-2027 to connect customers to cleaner energy, strengthen community resilience against extreme weather events and increase safety and reliability. The referenced capital plan only includes Sempra's proportionate ownership share of capital expenditures. Across the Sempra family of companies, 20,000 employees are bound by a common set of values — do the right thing, champion people and shape the future — and a shared vision to deliver energy with purpose. These values underpin Sempra's commitment to empowering communities and supporting social progress. Over the course of its 25-year history, Sempra's family of companies and the Sempra Foundation have contributed more than $440 million to charitable causes and continue to find innovative ways to support the communities they serve.About SempraSempra is a leading North American energy infrastructure company that helps meet the daily energy needs of nearly 40 million consumers. As the owner of one of the largest energy networks on the continent, Sempra is helping to electrify and decarbonize some of the world's most significant economic markets, including California, Texas, Mexico and the LNG export market. The company is also consistently recognized as a leader in sustainable business practices and for its long-standing commitment to building a high-performance culture focused on safety and operational excellence, leadership and workforce development and diversity and inclusion.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Vulcan Materials (VMC) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this construction materials company a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Vulcan is 7.2%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 27.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 16.3%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Vulcan is 17.3%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -7.3%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 13.3% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 9%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for Vulcan have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 1.1% over the past month.Bottom LineWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Vulcan a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Vulcan is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

346,ee45fb74-cf8a-38b9-bf7f-adf84c0da085,UNH,2023-06-29,UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 89% of the company,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/unitedhealth-group-incorporated-nyse-unh-110101057.html,1688036461,STORY,['UNH'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies UnitedHealth Group's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions50% of the business is held by the top 17 shareholders Recent sales by insiders Every investor in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 89% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of UnitedHealth Group, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About UnitedHealth Group?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.UnitedHealth Group already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see UnitedHealth Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in UnitedHealth Group. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.1% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.0% and 6.4% of the stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of UnitedHealth GroupWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that UnitedHealth Group Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$1.6b of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 11% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over UnitedHealth Group. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.

REUTERS/George Frey REFILE - CORRECTING MONTH (George Frey / reuters)But that's just one pressure point. Like other industries, the inflationary environment and worker shortages are also pressuring the industry, causing increased costs to be felt through all parts of the broader health system.""All health plans ranked inflationary impacts on health providers among the top three inflators for 2024. In a persisting high inflationary environment, hospitals and providers will often be pushed to seek significant rate increases from payers,"" the PwC report authors said.That, in turn, could affect what insurers charge for premiums, according to Kaiser Family Foundation's Larry Levitt.""There are cost pressures bubbling up throughout the health care system, and those higher costs will translate directly to higher premiums for employers and individuals,"" said Levitt, executive vice president of health policy.But, he added, ""While employers have historically tried to shift premium increases onto workers, that may be difficult in the current labor market with unemployment so low.""Story continuesAnd while the impact of inflation might be receding in other industries, it could only just be starting in healthcare.Ambulances are seen in front of the United States Capitol in Washington, DC., United States on December 08, 2022. (Photo by Celal Gunes/Anadolu Agency via Getty Images) (Anadolu Agency via Getty Images)In addition, the drop in Medicaid enrollees as a result of the end of the pandemic, and funding from the government, could increase the number of Affordable Care Act marketplace plan enrollees. While those individuals could be eligible for subsidies, the cost of utilizing the health plans will again add to the costs for insurers.But it's not all bad news. There are some small moves helping to neutralize the cost burden, according to the report.That includes more biosimilars on the market, which means cheaper options are available for patients and insurers, as well as more healthcare providers participating in relationships with insurers to receive bundled payments rather than individual fees for each service provided within a visit (known as value-based care). All of this helps to incrementally decrease the cost burden.In addition, thanks to the pandemic, the use of costly care sites like hospitals has decreased.""With the increased demand for home-based services and virtual care, the healthcare delivery system has reached a new phase. Plans are factoring in higher utilization of less expensive care settings and virtual care when pricing their 2023 plans and beyond, helping plans offset the trend inflators,"" the authors wrote.All told, if inflation and worker shortages persist, it could result in continued pressure on a struggling industry that is slow to adopt innovative changes.""Organizations need to reshape strategies, reengineer financial, workforce and business models and seize every transformational opportunity — from investments in innovation and technology to deals — to clear the path for a drastically different cost, capabilities and business footprint by 2030,"" the report said.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

(NYSE:EL) A Top Quality Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boasting-16-return-equity-est-130123401.html,1687957283,STORY,['EL'],"[Many investors are still learning about the various metrics that can be useful when analysing a stock. This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). We'll use ROE to examine The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL), by way of a worked example.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Estée Lauder Companies is:16% = US$1.1b ÷ US$6.7b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.16.Does Estée Lauder Companies Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Estée Lauder Companies has a better ROE than the average (11%) in the Personal Products industry.roeThat's what we like to see. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk.  Our risks dashboardshould have the 2 risks we have identified for Estée Lauder Companies.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesEstée Lauder Companies' Debt And Its 16% ROEEstée Lauder Companies clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.12. While its ROE is pretty respectable, the amount of debt the company is carrying currently is not ideal. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

Also, continued strength in the International segment bodes well.Backed by these strengths, the company posted the third straight quarter of top and bottom line beat in third-quarter fiscal 2023. Sales and earnings rose year over year. Earnings benefited from pricing gains and cost savings, negated by increased advertising investments, higher selling and administrative expenses, and a rise in commodity costs.

Gains from pricing and cost-saving initiatives were offset by elevated manufacturing and logistic costs, and higher commodity costs. It also marked the second consecutive quarter of a gross margin expansion on the back of cost pricing and high-cost savings.The gross margin is expected to increase 250-300 bps in fiscal 2023 compared with the prior mentioned 200 bps, driven by the combined benefits of pricing actions, cost-saving and supply-chain-optimization efforts, offset by continued cost inflation.CLX is on track with the IGNITE strategy, which focuses on the expansion of the key elements under the 2020 strategy to pace up innovation in each area of business. The IGNITE strategy encompasses the long-term financial targets of achieving net sales growth of 3-5%, an EBIT margin expansion of 25-50 bps and a free cash flow generation of 11-13% of sales.Management announced a streamlined operating model to create a faster, simpler company through the Reimagine Work under its IGNITE strategy. The operating model implemented in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 will help increase efficiencies and transform the company's operations in the areas of the supply chain, digital commerce, innovation, brand building and more, over the long term.The implementation of this new model is likely to be completed in fiscal 2024. The company expects the operating model to generate ongoing annual savings of $75-$100 million, with benefits likely to occur from fiscal 2023. Of this, it expects $40-60 million or 30 cents per share to be recognized in fiscal 2023 under other income and expenses.The company has been witnessing strong progress in the core International business as it continues to build on the success of the segment's Go Lean strategy. These efforts will help accelerate profitable growth for the segment. Driven by its IGNITE Strategy, which aims to improve profitability in the International business, the company expects to invest selectively in profitable platforms.CLX has been exploring international opportunities, including the acquisition of a majority stake in its joint venture in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The company believes that the acquisition will boost long-term growth in the International segment. In third-quarter fiscal 2023, organic sales for the International segment improved 1%, whereas organic sales for the segment improved 14%.Driven by these factors, CLX envisions 2023 year-over-year net sales growth of 1-2% compared with the prior mentioned 2% decline to 1% growth.

366,9cff7aeb-06c5-3843-b4b1-8bdedb443fb0,AAL,2023-06-29,An Intrinsic Calculation For American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) Suggests It's 49% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-american-airlines-group-121610608.html,1687954570,STORY,['AAL'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, American Airlines Group fair value estimate is US$34.24Current share price of US$17.35 suggests American Airlines Group is potentially 49% undervaluedOur fair value estimate is 88% higher than American Airlines Group's analyst price target of US$18.20How far off is American Airlines Group Inc. (NASDAQ:AAL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for American Airlines Group What's The Estimated Valuation?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.87bUS$2.09bUS$3.67bUS$4.17bUS$3.60bUS$3.28bUS$3.10bUS$3.00bUS$2.95bUS$2.93bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ -8.81%Est @ -5.54%Est @ -3.24%Est @ -1.64%Est @ -0.51% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 14% US$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$1.9kUS$1.5kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$908US$792(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$16bWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 14%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.9b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (14%– 2.1%) = US$25bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$25b÷ ( 1 + 14%)10= US$6.8bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$22b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$17.4, the company appears quite good value at a 49% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at American Airlines Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 14%, which is based on a levered beta of 2.000. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for American Airlines GroupStrengthNo major strengths identified for AAL.WeaknessInterest payments on debt are not well covered.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value?

The stock is presently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with earnings expectations modestly increasing across the board.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s dividend yields a solid 2.1% annually, nicely above the Zacks Retail &amp; Wholesale sector average. Of course, growth is there, too, with MCD sporting a 7% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcDonald’s has delivered better-than-expected results consistently as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate in five consecutive quarters. Just in its latest release, the restaurant titan penciled in a 14% earnings beat and delivered a 6% revenue surprise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAflacAflac is an American insurance company and a massive supplier of supplemental insurance within the U.S. The company currently sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with analysts taking their expectations higher among all timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAflac shares presently yield 2.5% annually, precisely in line with the Zacks Finance sector average.

Other reasons cited include conflicts with work hours (23%); not thinking about it (22%); dislike of going to the doctor (21%); insurance issues (21%); fear of hearing bad health news (18%); and time commitment to go to the doctor (16%).2According to the survey, about half of adults have avoided at least one common health screening, including tests for certain diseases and other exams. At the same time, 51% of respondents who have had cancer said their diagnosis came as a result of a routine checkup or screening.2 Men and women do not see eye to eye on their current and future health. Survey findings show the majority of men have a positive outlook regarding all aspects of their current health, including their ability to control it in the future: weight/BMI (56% men, 38% women); financial health (53% men, 40% women); mental health (66% men, 56% women); and physical health (69% men, 54% women). Hispanic men and women also have differing outlooks: weight/BMI (64% men, 45% women); financial health (57% men, 44% women); mental health (71% men, 62% women); and physical health (77% men, 63% women).2 Generational points of view show wide gap in control over health. According to the survey, Gen Z [ages 18-24] feels the least control over their mental and physical health, yet they are the most likely to skip annual wellness visits that could empower them to feel more in control. Baby boomers [ages 57-65] (64%) and Gen X [ages 41-56] (55%) think preventive care is very important to their overall health and well-being, versus millennials [ages 25-40] (49%) and Gen Z (40%).2Story continuesManaging health and wellness does not come easy for U.S. Hispanic population. Among Hispanic survey respondents, 31% indicate language is a barrier to accessing preventive care resources. As a result, 72% have avoided a wellness screening, compared to 46% who do not feel it is a barrier. Many Hispanic respondents also agree (61%) that health care providers and organizations need to better engage and educate the Latino community about the benefits of being proactive with their health and wellness.2Screenings work and lead to better outcomes. A significant number (72%) of Hispanic survey respondents diagnosed with cancer found out at a routine medical exam or regularly scheduled annual screening, compared to 46% of the general population.2An analysis of Aflac internal data reveals its cancer wellness benefit claims dropped in 2022 compared to 2019 - notably among younger generations. For every 1,000 Aflac policyholders, cancer policy wellness claims dropped 11% for those in their 20s and 9% for those in their 30s.3""The results of the Wellness Matters survey put a spotlight on the need for individuals to have a more proactive approach to their health care,"" said Tom Morey, chief actuary, Aflac U.S. ""That is why Aflac is encouraging policyholders and others to take control of their health by building good health habits early, asking health and insurance providers questions, and prioritizing routine wellness checkups.""Take wellness matters into your own hands - sooner rather than later. According to the survey, individuals are more likely to schedule checkups and prioritize wellness screenings as adults if their parents or caregivers demonstrated good habits, such as scheduling childhood wellness appointments, early in life. Most individuals are self-motivated to go to the doctor, most notably Baby boomers (64%), followed by Gen X (45%), millennials (35%), and Gen Z (29%). Additionally, encouragement from loved ones and financial incentives can help motivate individuals to seek preventive care. Many (64%) say they benefit from friends and family who encourage them to go to the doctor for routine visits. Most (85%) are more likely to go to a routine checkup appointment if a cash incentive was offered to help with the cost.2Learn more at Aflac.com/WellnessMatters.ABOUT THE STUDY The 2023 Wellness Matters Survey was conducted among a nationally representative sample of 2,001 employed U.S. adults ages 18-65 in June 2023 by Kantar Profiles on behalf of Aflac.

HCA, Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, Tenet Healthcare Corp. THC and Community Health Systems, Inc. CYH.Industry: Medical - HospitalLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2114033/4-hospital-stocks-in-focus-amid-improving-industry-trendsHospital companies are now enjoying improving market conditions following several quarters of hardships in the form of labor shortages and rising costs. The easing staffing challenges are boosting hospitals' margins. Seniors are now undergoing delayed elective surgeries, increasing patient days and occupancies, boosting Zacks Medical-Hospital industry players' revenues.However, growing competition in this market remains a common theme. Technological innovations and implementations are expected to provide companies with a competitive edge and improve efficiency. Industry players like HCA Healthcare Inc., Universal Health Services Inc., Tenet Healthcare Corp. and Community Health Systems, Inc. are expected to benefit from these developments.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Medical-Hospital industry comprises for-profit hospital companies that provide healthcare through different types of hospitals, such as acute care, rehabilitation and psychiatric. These hospital entities are engaged in internal medicine, general surgery, cardiology, oncology, neurosurgery, orthopedics and obstetrics, telehealth services, mental health care and diagnostic and emergency services.Revenues of these companies depend on inpatient occupancy levels, medical and ancillary services ordered by physicians and provided to patients, and the volume of outpatient procedures. These hospital companies receive payments for patient services from the government under the Medicare program, Medicaid or similar programs, managed care plans (including plans offered through the American Health Benefit Exchanges), private insurers and directly from patients.Story continues4 Key Trends Defining Hospital Industry's FutureGrowing Patient Volumes: With declining pandemic-related constraints, seniors are now undergoing delayed elective procedures. Pent-up demand for procedures like hip and knee surgeries is likely to drive patient volumes. Growth in deferred procedures, admissions, outpatient surgeries and Medicare reimbursements are expected to support hospital companies' revenues. However, inflationary pressures and financial constraints can force some patients to delay addressing certain non-emergency medical needs. The benefits of the Affordable Care Act and similar safety nets can provide patients with some respite, which can help them navigate tough times.Expanding Elderly Population: Advancements in science, nutrition and healthcare will enable the senior population to witness constant growth. Over the long run, this will likely expand the demand for hospital services. The U.S. Census Bureau's revised report suggests that people above 65 years are projected to be one of the fastest-growing segments of the nation's population, signaling an advancement from 17% in 2020 to 21% in 2030.By 2034, older adults are predicted to outnumber children, which will be the first in U.S. history. The median age of the country grew by 0.2 years to 38.9 years during the 2021-2022 period. The change in demographic and the rising incidence of diseases are expected to be industry drivers. Also, the increasing number of people signing up for healthcare plans through the Affordable Care Act indicates fewer challenges to visiting hospitals in the future.Technological Advancements: Technological improvements, innovations and wider adoption will continue to support hospital players. This should optimize hospitals' services, minimize unnecessary costs and elevate the patient experience. The COVID-19 pandemic triggered the adoption of telehealth and telemedicine services, which are expected to rise in the future as well. The companies are leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and automation, along with real-time analytics, to provide quality care. AI helps improve clinical workflow management and medical diagnosis that hospitals utilize, which will limit patients' waiting time and reduce their treatment costs.Climbing Expenses: Despite implementing cost-curbing efforts, the rising patient volumes are likely to increase operating costs. Rising prices of hospital supplies due to inflationary pressures will keep margins under pressure. Also, growth-project investments will keep expenses elevated, affecting the bottom line in the short run. However, improving labor shortages and staffing challenges will continue to provide hospital companies some breathing room. Also, contract renegotiations with suppliers and vendors will provide an impetus.Zacks Industry Rank Depicts Promising ScenarioThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-Hospital industry, which is housed within the broader Zacks Medical sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #114, which places it in the top 45% of nearly 250 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.

(NYSE:FCX) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.15 per share on the 1st of August. Including this payment, the dividend yield on the stock will be 1.5%, which is a modest boost for shareholders' returns. See our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan Freeport-McMoRan's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsIf it is predictable over a long period, even low dividend yields can be attractive. Before making this announcement, Freeport-McMoRan was paying a whopping 136% as a dividend, but this only made up 33% of its overall earnings. A cash payout ratio this high could put the dividend under pressure and force the company to reduce it in the future if it were to run into tough times.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 39.3%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 20%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendDividend VolatilityAlthough the company has a long dividend history, it has been cut at least once in the last 10 years. Since 2013, the dividend has gone from $1.25 total annually to $0.60. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 7.1% per year. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges.Freeport-McMoRan May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendDividends have been going in the wrong direction, so we definitely want to see a different trend in the earnings per share. However, Freeport-McMoRan has only grown its earnings per share at 3.0% per annum over the past five years. While growth may be thin on the ground, Freeport-McMoRan could always pay out a higher proportion of earnings to increase shareholder returns.Our Thoughts On Freeport-McMoRan's DividendOverall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. With cash flows lacking, it is difficult to see how the company can sustain a dividend payment. We don't think Freeport-McMoRan is a great stock to add to your portfolio if income is your focus.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

This change lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily loss of 0.04%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.22%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 2.93%.Heading into today, shares of the food and beverage company had gained 2.54% over the past month, outpacing the Consumer Staples sector's gain of 2.18% and lagging the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.22% in that time.PepsiCo will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be July 13, 2023. On that day, PepsiCo is projected to report earnings of $1.95 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 4.84%. Our most recent consensus estimate is calling for quarterly revenue of $21.63 billion, up 6.97% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.30 per share and revenue of $90.66 billion. These totals would mark changes of +7.51% and +4.94%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for PepsiCo. Recent revisions tend to reflect the latest near-term business trends. As such, positive estimate revisions reflect analyst optimism about the company's business and profitability.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell). It has a remarkable, outside-audited track record of success, with #1 stocks delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 23.4.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that PEP currently has a PEG ratio of 3.25. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. PEP's industry had an average PEG ratio of 2.5 as of yesterday's close.The Beverages - Soft drinks industry is part of the Consumer Staples sector. This industry currently has a Zacks Industry Rank of 42, which puts it in the top 17% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

Of course, growth is there, too, with MCD sporting a 7% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMcDonald’s has delivered better-than-expected results consistently as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate in five consecutive quarters. Just in its latest release, the restaurant titan penciled in a 14% earnings beat and delivered a 6% revenue surprise.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAflacAflac is an American insurance company and a massive supplier of supplemental insurance within the U.S. The company currently sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with analysts taking their expectations higher among all timeframes.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAflac shares presently yield 2.5% annually, precisely in line with the Zacks Finance sector average.
