We will also discuss the emerging trends and key players in the extended reality industry. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Biggest Augmented Reality And VR Companies In The World.Extended reality is an umbrella term encompassing all immersive technologies, including augmented, virtual, and mixed reality. Immersive technologies combine or replace our physical reality with a virtual one. In augmented reality, the user experiences virtual information intermingled with the real world. Instead of being isolated from the physical world, the user experiences the interplay of virtual elements like images, animations, and information with their actual surroundings. Snapchat by Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) and Pokémon Go by Niantic are some of the most well-known examples of augmented reality. On March 23, Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) launched a separate division for businesses, AR Enterprise Services (ARES), that facilitates them to build AR features for their websites and apps. As of March, almost 250 million people interact with AR on Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) daily, posing a good opportunity for enterprises to correspond with their customers. The first product by ARES is Shopping Suite, which lets consumers virtually try different products and find their right fit before buying. Businesses can optimize and manage their augmented reality assets and integrations and measure performance analytics using this feature. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is one of the leading names in bringing AR to the mainstream.  In virtual reality, the user is fully immersed in the digitally created environment. The user feels transported into an alternate reality completely disconnected from the real one. Virtual reality requires the user to put on a VR headset, whereas augmented reality can be accessed using a screen like a mobile or tablet. Mixed reality merges the physical and virtual worlds.  Story continuesThe Extended Reality Industry OutlookExtended reality technology has found numerous applications in our everyday life. It can be used in entertainment, education, training, estate tours, and many other areas. In healthcare, it is used to train medical professionals in simulation. It helps them visualize the patient's organs prior to surgery and target organs better. The surgeons then operate, greatly reducing the risks involved. According to a report by Knowledge Sourcing Intelligence LLP, the extended reality market was valued at $11.514 billion in 2021 and has been estimated to reach $95.438 billion by 2028, growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 35.27% through the forecasted period.The popularity of extended reality is constantly rising; however, the growth has been relatively slow. The two main factors for this slow growth include privacy concerns as well as the high cost of production. The VR headset needs to be compact but efficient, thus increasing the production cost. The high cost implies fewer people could afford it, and sales would be low. Thus developments and advancements in the hardware segment would catalyze the market growth for extended reality. Furthermore, to create a truly immersive experience large amounts of information from the user's environment is collected. This extensive flux of information creates a privacy concern. North America currently has the biggest share in the global extended reality market. The main reason for this large claim is the presence of most of the key players in this region. Companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) are all present in this region. However, the Asia Pacific region is expected to grow rapidly in the future. The rapid boost in technology development, 5G, and the use of smartphones would be the main contributors to this growth. The pandemic also catalyzed the popularity of extended reality products as the shift towards remote work caused a surge in demand. The gaming industry especially poses a great opportunity for the growth of extended reality technology in this region. According to a report by Technavio, the Asia Pacific region is estimated to contribute 37% to the growth of the global extended reality market from 2023 through 2027. On June 1, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) announced that the company will soon launch the next generation of its mixed-reality headset, the Meta Quest 3. The new generation would be 40% thinner and have enhanced graphics performance than the previous product. The device will be launched in a few months, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has promised to give more details at the company's annual AR/VR conference on September 27. VR headsets are currently used predominantly in gaming. However, companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) have been trying to market it as a productivity and fitness tool. On June 5, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced their extended reality headset, Vision Pro. The Vision Pro starts at $3,499 which is almost three times the price of Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) headset. The Vision Pro uses a new chip, R1, that claims to process information from its sensors faster than the blink of an eye. The headset has a transparent display allowing the user to still see their environment while interacting with virtual elements. The users can select options by just blinking or tapping their fingers together. On June 5, Erik Woodring, equity research executive director at Morgan Stanley, in a CNBC interview talked about the future of the product and gave valuable insight into how the extended reality market would grow with time. Here are some comments from his interview:""I did partially (use the word consumer as opposed to enterprise) because I think the early use cases are going to be more on the consumer side; that's not to say we're excluding the enterprise market at all. There are use cases that exist today in AR and VR and that will exist in the future with AR VR in the enterprise, but think of Apple as largely a consumer brand getting into the enterprise. I think of the same way when it comes to mixed reality headsets, the consumer is the primary customer today, the enterprise will be a customer tomorrow, but the opportunity today is bigger for the consumer.""In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), some other big tech names that are making hefty investments in AR and VR include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).20 Biggest Augmented Reality And VR Companies In The WorldBairachnyi Dmitry/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To make our list of the 20 biggest augmented reality and VR companies in the world, we sifted through various AR/VR ETFs and identified their top holdings.

10,de4de965-e869-34c3-8eff-d031f9597621,NUE,2023-08-22,Investors Heavily Search Nucor Corporation (NUE): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-nucor-corporation-130006016.html,1692622806,STORY,['NUE'],"[Nucor (NUE) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this steel company have returned +2.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.9% change. The Zacks Steel - Producers industry, to which Nucor belongs, has lost 2.1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Nucor is expected to post earnings of $4.77 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -26.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +8%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.76 points to a change of -34.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +2.3%.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.13 indicates a change of -35.4% from what Nucor is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Nucor.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Nucor, the consensus sales estimate of $9.14 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -12.9%. The $35.8 billion and $33.45 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -13.8% and -6.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNucor reported revenues of $9.52 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.3%. EPS of $5.81 for the same period compares with $9.67 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -2.16%. The EPS surprise was +3.94%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Nucor is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Nucor.

If you want to skip our introduction to the biotechnology industry and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then head on over to 5 Most Profitable Biotech Stocks Today. Biotechnology is one of the fastest growing industries these days. Its successes have been influenced in a large amount by the advances in technology which have enabled biotechnology companies to develop new treatments, medicines, and products with the computing power that was unavailable just a decade ago. One technology that has been at the center of the attention of both the stock market and the media is artificial intelligence. In the biotech industry there are many companies using AI to make innovative treatments. One firm that has been using AI and machine learning in biotechnology for years now is Atomwise. The company uses a computational neural network (CNN) to discover billions of small molecules for drug development. As of 2023, Atomwise has generated more than $174 million in funding from venture capital financing, and the company also has a partnership with the pharmaceutical giant Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) for a deal that can potentially be worth $1 billion to discover medical compounds that will exclusively be used by Sanofi.Another firm that integrated AI into its operations before the recent hype is Eyenuk, Inc. It uses its AI platform called EyeArt to not only screen for eye diseases based on images but also predict whether such diseases can occur in the future. The firm scored a big win in June 2023 when the FDA approved a camera to be used with its EyeArt system to detect diabetic retinopathy.These developments make it clear that the biotechnology sector is perhaps one of the most revolutionary industries these days. They also show that the industry has a lot of potential apart from developing vaccines for the coronavirus pandemic - which itself has proved to be a major catalyst for the sector. Another big catalyst that might make biotechnology one of the most lucrative industries in the world is its ability to develop treatments for some of the most deadly and painful diseases known to humans. These diseases are collectively referred to as cancer, and cancer can affect a lot of body organs which makes it difficult to develop treatments since each different kind of cancer has its own mutations. Cancer treatments are further complicated by the fact that while some options do exist, cancer cells often evolve to defeat them.Story continuesOn this front, researchers from New York University's Langone Health Center have researched new antibodies to biologically 'mark' the cancer cells so that the body's immune system can target them and fight the disease. The treatment shows potential as a lab study with dish grown cancer cells saw immune system antibodies successfully recognize the cancer cell 'flags' and attack them as a result. Another firm that is leveraging biotechnology and artificial intelligence to fight cancer is Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A). Agilent has partnered up with another company, Visiopharm, to use AI for sifting through datasets for recognizing biological patterns in images to diagnose the correct diseases for an effective treatment plan.However, not all is rosy in the biotechnology industry. While the technologies, developments, and treatments that we've shared above have immense potential, the simple fact is that these technologies cost vast sums of money simply for research and development. At the same time, the fruits of this spending might take years to appear, which often ends up making several biotechnology firms unprofitable. To gauge a sense of just how capitally intensive spending in the biotechnology industry is, consider the fact that according to Deloitte, the average cost of developing a drug sits at a whopping $2.3 billion at the biggest biopharmaceutical companies in the world. At the same time, the return on investment on these drugs sits at just 1.2% - so the biotechnology companies have to be absolutely certain of future market potential and profitability when investing in drugs.As to the biotechnology companies themselves, we made a list of the 10 Most Promising Biotech Stocks According to Analysts to find out that the top firms were Zai Lab Limited (NASDAQ:ZLAB), Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIR), and Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA). Here is what the management of Vir Biotechnology had to say during its latest earnings call:Now, let’s turn to chronic hepatitis B. Unlike the current standard-of-care, which requires taking antiviral medicines for the rest of one’s life and does not eliminate the risk of cirrhosis or liver cancer, our goal is a functional cure. After completing a functional cure therapy, there should be no need for further treatment and there should also be a further reduction in the risk of liver complications. Our functional cure hypothesis is based on a novel widely accepted belief that chronic hepatitis B is an immunologic disease caused by a virus. As such, we believe that combinations of anti-virus alone are not enough. Instead, we believe functional cure requires a combination of antivirus with immunologic agents.We call our approach stop and clear. We stop the virus from replicating and clear already infected cells by immune-stimulation. This is the fundamentally different hypothesis we seek to prove in our clinical trials. Our clinical development pathway has been as follows. We began with Phase 1 and Phase 2a studies that are exploring different combinations of anti-virals and immunomodulators. By specifically using small courts in these studies, we are able to explore a broad space of possibilities to help identify the right combination, dose, duration, frequency, and population. In the studies, we have made two major advances towards a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B that highlight why we believe we can succeed. One, At 11 June, we showed that we could achieve a durable off treatment response in 16% of participants who received VIR-2218, and pegylated interferon alpha for 48 weeks.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most profitable biotechnology companies in the world out of which the top picks are Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc.

Yet, stiff competition and rising costs do not bode well. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Edwards Lifesciences expects to maintain its leadership position in the global Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) market through an increased focus on expanding patient access by actively leveraging current valve platforms for additional indications. This includes developing next-generation valve platforms and maintaining trusted relationships with clinicians, payers and regulators.Across the product group, Edwards Lifesciences’ sales growth continues to be driven by its leading SAPIEN platform. In the second quarter, TAVR sales in the United States were particularly aided by improved hospital staffing levels and the continued SAPIEN 3Ultra RESILIA launch. The company recently noted that it will begin enrolment for the ALLIANCE pivotal trial, designed to study the next-generation TAVR technology, SAPIEN X4.The growth of the Surgical Structural Heart business is driven by increased penetration of Edwards Lifesciences’ premium RESILIA products across all regions.

Per the last update, patient enrollment for the study continued in the second quarter.On the flip side, Edwards Lifesciences has been grappling with escalated expenses for a while. In the second quarter of 2023, the company’s SG&amp;A expenses rose 14.4%. Per management, the expenses are likely to remain around 29%-30% of sales for the full year, as the company continues to invest in field-based personnel and therapy adoption initiatives.Story continuesFurther, R&amp;D expenses in the second quarter were up 7.8%. Overall R&amp;D costs are likely to remain elevated to nearly 17%-18% of sales, with investments being made in developing new technologies and generating evidence to support TAVR and Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies.Added to this, during the first quarter of 2023, Edwards Lifesciences entered into an intellectual property agreement with Medtronic, in which the former agreed to a 15-year mutual covenant to not sue with regard to certain structural heart products. A $300 million payment was made to Medtronic in consideration for the agreement — of which approximately has been expensed, and the other half will be amortized over the next 15 years.In the second quarter, EW recorded a $139 million charge related to the agreement, impacting the company’s bottom line.A tough competitive landscape and foreign exchange headwinds are the other downsides.Over the past year, shares of EW have plunged 20.1% compared with the industry’s 3.1% decline.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Haemonetics HAE, Quanterix QTRX and SiBone SIBN, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

Maxx and Marshalls, all raised their full-year outlooks last week after reporting stronger than expected sales in the second quarter. These retailers, which live in the off-price and discount sector, benefited from a value-focused trend pushing consumers to save where they can during an uncertain economic environment.More from Footwear NewsTarget CEO Addresses Pride Controversy &amp; How the Chain Will Move Forward After Sales HitTJ Maxx Is Winning Bama Rush - and Gen Z“Customers are stretching their dollars further and seeking better value across more categories more often,” said Walmart CFO John Rainey in a call with investors last week. He also noted that sales of grocery staples and in-home meals saw an uptick, in addition to kitchen tools that can assist in at-home meal prep.“They’re also buying more necessities and focusing on lower-priced items and brands,” he said.Ross Stores’ CEO Barbara Rentler noted in a call with investors that consumers responded well to its “improved value offerings” throughout its stores. TJX Companies’ apparel business, including accessories, saw a high single-digit comp increase, despite the discretionary nature of that category.“Across the board in retail, we see a flight to value as shoppers look to make their budgets stretch further,” said managing director of GlobalData Neil Saunders in a statement. “Through its various banners, TJX is on the right side of these trends and is benefitting as a result. That said, we also recognize the skill that goes into creating a compelling assortment which makes consumers want to part with their money.”BTIG analyst Janine Stichter also surmised that the strong results across these three retailers suggest that value is resonating with consumers.“The relative strength in the value segment suggests a trade-down, notably in apparel where off-price is clearly outperforming full-price,” wrote BTIG analyst Janine Stichter in a Sunday note to investors. “The stronger relative performance of consumables and private label suggests consumers remaining judicious.”Story continuesThe outlier case among these companies was Target, which downgraded its full-year outlook after noting softer spending in discretionary categories. At the same time, several footwear brands this quarter experienced significant declines this quarter amid inventory excesses, a conservative wholesale environment and consumers who are spending less on discretionary categories. In the last few weeks, Adidas, Steve Madden, Skechers, Deckers, Puma and Columbia Sportswear have all specifically lamented the challenges in the U.S. market.Jane Hali &amp; Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez noted that recent store checks for TJX, Burlington Coat Factory and Ross all appeared to have strong traffic and that strong back-to-school assortments in each chain will likely continue to be a further tailwind for the channel through the summer“We continue to believe the off-price sector is best positioned during this difficult discretionary market,” Ramirez wrote in a note to clients. “The channel offers great value on branded product.”Best of Footwear NewsA History of Forever 21: From Humble Beginnings to Bankruptcy and the Shaquille O'Neal BouncebackFootwear Company CEOs You Should KnowList of Footwear Company CEOs You Should Know]"

(WMT) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walmart-inc-wmt-attracting-investor-130010512.html,1692622810,STORY,['WMT'],"[Walmart (WMT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest retailer have returned -0.3%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Retail - Supermarkets industry, which Walmart falls in, has gained 2.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Walmart is expected to post earnings of $1.50 per share for the current quarter, representing no change from the year-ago quarter. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.39 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +1.6%. This estimate has changed +3.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.03 indicates a change of +10% from what Walmart is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Walmart.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Walmart, the consensus sales estimate of $158.06 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.4%. The $641.94 billion and $664.22 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +5% and +3.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryWalmart reported revenues of $161.63 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.7%. EPS of $1.84 for the same period compares with $1.77 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $159.82 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.13%. The EPS surprise was +8.88%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Walmart is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Walmart. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Retail sales for July were up 0.7% from the previous month, which was well above estimates of 0.4%. This among a number of other economic data points say one thing quite emphatically, the US economy is very strong. Further confirming this notion, is GDP growth estimates. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta provides a nowcast estimating US annual economic growth and revised the number this week to 5.8%. Consumers Favor DiscountsHowever, contrary to this data, we saw an interesting trend emerge from the totality of these earnings. Consumers are shifting their buying patterns to make more purchases at discount retailers.While both Target and Home Depot beat earnings estimates, Target missed on sales, and both retailers are expecting slower growth over the next year. Home Depot reiterated its forward guidance after lowering the outlook last quarter and Target guided lower on both sales and revenue forecasts.Target CEO Brian Cornell noted on the earnings call that ""As we look at the consumer landscape today, we recognize the consumer is still challenged by the levels of inflation that they're seeing in food and beverage and household essentials...So that's absorbing a much bigger portion of their budget.""On the flip side, both Walmart and The TJX Companies raised forward guidance and beat sales and earnings estimates.Not too surprisingly, Walmart and The TJX Companies enjoy Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) ratings, while Target and Home Depot have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesThe TJX CompaniesThe TJX Companies is a leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide with 4,865 stores. The company's broad range of assortments at varying prices helps it to reach out to a broad range of consumers. Additionally, TJX attracts consumers through rapid turn of inventories, which makes for an always fresh range of discounted products.On Wednesday, TJX reported Q2 earnings. EPS came in at $0.85, a 23% YoY increase and well above estimates of $0.77. Sales $12.76 billion also beat estimates of $12.45 billion and showed a 7.7% YoY gain.TJX has begun to see analysts revise earnings estimates higher, with both FY23 and FY24 earnings being upgraded by 1% over the last month. Both sales and earnings are projected to grow at a very nice pace over the next two years.Shares of TJX blasted to all-time highs following the stellar earnings report and are now up 13.2% YTD. The TJX Companies stock has compounded at an annual rate of 14% over the last ten years, outperforming the broad market.TJX is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 25x, which is below the industry average of 27x, and above its 10-year median of 21.2x. Additionally, the company offers a dividend yield of 1.5% and has raised the payment by an average of 9.7% annually over the last five years.WalmartSurprisingly, Walmart shares are selling off following its exceptional earnings report. Nonetheless, the stock looks very appealing at the current levels, and new business verticals at the retail giant look to be paying off.WMT has been gaining momentum in two of its high margin revenue streams; advertisements and its membership program Walmart+. Walmart has added in-store ads in the aisles, on the checkout screens, and played over the stores radio, and has recruited its most engaged customers to its membership program. These developments have been critical in raising earnings expectations. The advertisement business grew a reported 36% YoY.Walmart also saw momentum in its e-commerce business. Online sales jumped 24% YoY.Analysts have taken notice and began raising earnings estimates over the last two months. Current quarter earnings estimates have been raised by 1.2%, and FY23 estimates by 0.6%.WMT is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 25.5x, which is above the industry average of 23.2x, and above its five-year median of 23.4x. The company also pays a dividend yield of 1.4% and has raised it by an average of 1.9% annually over the last five years.Target After trading immediately lower following the earnings report, Target stock has recovered and rallied ~5% off its 2023 lows. And while investors may want to wait for analysts to begin revising their earnings estimates higher, raising its Zacks Rank, TGT is now trading at a fairly compelling valuation.Target is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 16.2x, which is well below the industry average of 27x, and below its five-year median of 18.3x. The company also pays a dividend yield of 3.4% and has raised the payment by an average of 13% annually over the last five years.Admittedly, earnings estimates have been revised lower almost unanimously by analysts. Current quarter earnings estimates have been downgraded by -7.4% and FY23 earnings estimates by -4.5%.However, another point on the bullish side is that EPS are projected to grow nicely in the coming quarters. Current quarter earnings are expected to climb 23% YoY to $1.89 and FY23 EPS are forecast to grow 31% YoY to $7.88. This follows management's effort to build back profitability at the retailer.Target shares are now -50% off their all-time high. The stock has compounded at an annual rate of 8.1% over the last 20 years, underperforming the broad market.Home DepotHome Depot has compounded at an incredible 15% annually over the last 20 years, far outperforming the broad market. HD also offers a dividend yield of 2.5% and has raised it by an average of 14.5% annually over the last five years.However, as fantastic as the stock has been over the years, the near future may be a bit rocky. While HD reported EPS of $4.65 beating estimates of $4.45 it showed a YoY decline from $5.05. Sales also beat estimates and showed a slight decline YoY.The earnings revision trend has been mixed, giving HD a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but forecasts are weak over the next year. Sales and earnings are expected to fall through the year end. Although there is a light at the end of the tunnel, sales and earnings growth are expected to resume in FY24.While HD management still believes their core customers are in a healthy place economically, the reality is that Covid pulled forward a lot of DIY home improvement sales. With people stuck at home during the pandemic, many homeowners opted to do work on their homes, and are not yet at the point where they need to do more.Home Depot is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.3x, which is above the market average of 20.6x, and just above its 10-year median of 21.2x.Bottom LineThe US economy is in an interesting position, and this week's retail earnings provided some useful information. Obviously, the economy is growing at a nice pace, however the average American is still dealing with a tight budget, forced to cut certain expenses to cover the necessities.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

22,d8d9da3d-7e70-3ef5-94cb-45b22abfec53,JWN,2023-08-22,"Will Macy’s, Nordstrom merchandise overhauls lure shoppers?",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/macy-nordstrom-merchandise-overhauls-lure-161026043.html,1692634226,STORY,"['JWN', 'M']","[By Katherine MastersNEW YORK (Reuters) - Quarterly results from Macy's and Nordstrom this week will allow investors to find out whether new inventory at lower prices, like $59.50 pull-on work pants and discounted UGG slippers, are finally drawing shoppers back to the U.S. department store chains.In an effort to boost sales, Macy's - which reports second-quarter results on Tuesday - has focused on revamping its private brands, including its new On 34th label launched in July. Nordstrom, which reports results on Thursday, hopes to turn around its struggling off-price Rack business with a focus on 100 ""strategic"" brands, Chief Executive Officer Erik Nordstrom told investors in March.Analysts expect Macy's to post a 87% slide in second-quarter profit, dragged down by heavy discounting to clear spring and early summer merchandise, according to Refinitiv.Nordstrom's second-quarter revenue is expected to fall 11% while analysts anticipate a nearly 45% fall in profit.Retailers from Target to Coach parent Tapestry have cut expectations for profits and sales for the year as U.S. shoppers cut back on purchases of discretionary items like handbags and apparel.Both Macy's and Nordstrom may be losing share in women's apparel to value retailers such as Walmart and Amazon, according to survey data from analytics company Prosper.In mid-July, it asked more than 7,800 men and women where they most often shopped for women's clothing. Thirteen percent answered Walmart and 9% answered Amazon, compared to 5.8% for Macy's and 3.3% for Nordstrom.Consulting firm Deloitte predicted in July that back-to-school spending on children and young adult clothing would fall 14% year-over-year. Deloitte reported that parents are prioritizing school supplies such as pens and notebooks over clothing and technology such as laptops and tablets.Results for the quarter ended July 30 can provide only a partial snapshot of the back-to-school shopping season. Still, the retailers' executives may provide Wall Street with new clues on what styles, if any, are selling well ahead of the new school year.Story continuesMacy's new private-label brand, On 34th, is aimed at women aged 30 to 50 and includes low-priced staples such as a soft-knit button-down top priced at $39.50, as well as trendier apparel like a $79.50 tulle midi-skirt and a $275 suede leather jacket.At a launch event last month, Macy’s top executives said the brand was designed for “seasonless” dressing, with knits and fabrics - including items such as fine-gauge sweaters - meant for layering.Macy’s owns more than 20 private label brands, which are developed by the retailer and produced by its own suppliers rather than purchased wholesale from other apparel makers.Private brands accounted for roughly 16% of Macy's sales in 2022, and the retailer is hoping that focusing on more versatile apparel will help it avoid the heavy discounts it has had to make on unsold spring and summer clothing, which will likely drag down profits.Kathy Gersch, a retail industry consultant at Kotter International, said stores' own private labels are more profitable than buying inventory wholesale from third-party garment makers. Yet the higher profit margins can be offset by heavier investments by stores in product development and marketing.“They have to try to make them more compelling than other mass market clothing in order to make it a real draw, so people actually come in for those brands,” she said.Nordstrom so far has disclosed few specifics about the new merchandise intended to revive the Rack, including the brands and categories it plans to prioritize. But executives have told investors to expect improvements in its assortment by mid-2023. On Monday, Rack’s website was advertising brands including Kate Spade, Adidas, Steve Madden and Cole Haan.Nordstrom's focus on revamping its inventory came after a disastrous effort to bring in more low-priced goods, which turned off shoppers visiting Rack stores for deals on the same clothing and accessories available at Nordstrom.(Reporting by Katherine Masters in New York; Granth Vanaik and Savyata Mishra in Bengaluru; editing by Deepa Babington)]"

Subject to regulatory nod, the agreement is likely to complete in late 2023. However, the terms of the same have been kept under wraps.Honan seems to be a prudent pick by the Marsh business since the former has witnessed a period of solid growth in the form of pursuing numerous buyouts and boosting revenues in the past three years. This stellar performance in the said time frame can be attributed to the assistance, which it has received from the global private equity firm and the majority shareholder of Honan, TA Associates.  Therefore, the acquisition of Honan will enable the MMC unit to hold 80% stake in TA.Honan boasts a widespread customer base of more than 30,000 stretched across Australia, New Zealand, and Asia. For nearly six decades, it has exceled in providing corporate risk advisory, employee benefits, and strata and real estate insurance services to large residential buildings, agents and landlords.Management of Marsh believes that the inclusion of Honan’s well-established capabilities, specifically in the field of corporate risk and strata insurance, will enhance its specialist competence. This, in turn, will enable Marsh to better serve its client base across Australia and New Zealand. In fact, the collective expertise of Marsh and Honan will roll out cutting-edge solutions for equipping customers to more effectively steer the risks encountered.Acquisitions form one of the core growth strategies of Marsh &amp; McLennan and buyouts similar to the latest one add strength to its capabilities, expand services offerings and enable the company to enter new geographies as well as solidify its foothold across existing markets. An upgraded services suite is likely to lure more customers and contribute more to the revenues of MMC in the days ahead.Story continuesMarsh &amp; McLennan spent $859 million and $572 million on acquisitions in 2021 and 2022, respectively. It remains quite active this year as well, by expending $292 million on buyouts in the first half of 2023.When it comes to acquisitions, Marsh McLennan Agency (MMA), a division of MMC’s Marsh business, requires a special mention. MMA delivers business insurance, employee health and benefits, retirement and wealth management, and private client insurance solutions to individuals and mid-market organizations. MMA boasts an impressive acquisition history of purchasing more than 100 agencies since 2009. This June, it acquired the Texas-based SOLV Risk Solutions for an undisclosed amount.The sound performance of MMA boosts the performance of the Marsh business, which along with Guy Carpenter, forms a part of the Risk and Insurance Services segment. It has to be noted that the segment usually contributes the most significant chunk to the total revenues of Marsh &amp; McLennan. In the first half of 2023, the contribution of the Risk and Insurance Services segment to MMC’s total revenues stood at 64.6%. Shares of Marsh &amp; McLennan have gained 15.1% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 12.3% growth. MMC currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks in the insurance space are Brown &amp; Brown, Inc.

RYAN.Industry: InsuranceLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2138164/5-insurance-brokerage-stocks-to-benefit-from-higher-demandBetter pricing, prudent underwriting, rising demand for insurance products and global expansion have been driving revenues of the Zacks  Insurance Brokerage industry players. The fast-paced consolidations in this traditionally fragmented industry are expected to benefit Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Aon plc, Brown and Brown, Erie Indemnity and Ryan Specialty Holdings, Inc.The increasing adoption of technology and higher spending on technology will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Brokerage Insurance industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services. Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice, keeping in mind clients' interests against brokerage fees. Thus, their business is directly linked with clients' level of business activity. Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management, third-party administration and managed healthcare services.Per a report by Allied Market Research, the global insurance brokerage market is projected to rise to $395 billion by 2027 or at an eight-year (2020-2027) CAGR of 7.3%. Research Dive estimates industry players combined to generate $515.3 billion in revenues by 2028, up at an eight-year (2021-2028) CAGR of 5.4%. Increased digitization has been helping to improve operational performance.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Insurance Brokerage IndustryIncreased Demand for Products to Drive Revenues: Industry players are continually expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products, while the rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance. Government initiatives should also add to the upside.Story continuesThe operational results of the industry players are affected directly by clients' level of business activity, which, in turn, depends on the extent of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve. Also, they must design products that are more appealing to customers.  This apart, better pricing ensures higher commissions for the industry players. Mergers and Acquisitions: The insurance brokerage industry is witnessing fast-paced consolidation. The industry has been traditionally fragmented, with a number of small players. One of the factors driving mergers and acquisitions is the companies' need to become specialized in their businesses. Some other factors driving M&amp;A are the interest shown by private equity firms in this sector, growing competition and lack of organic growth.Increased Adoption of Technology: To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others.These players are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate. Accelerated digitalization is also helping in curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. Increased digitization will help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and retention rate.While investments in technology help increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, players must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector.

Since touching a roughly 15-year high of $51.35 on July 31, the shares have worked their way lower on the charts. In fact, MGM is down 16.8% in August, though a bull signal is flashing on the charts that could help it reclaim some of these losses.Specifically, MGM is trading within one standard deviation of its 200-day moving average. According to data from Schaeffer's Senior Quantitative Analyst Rocky White, four similar signals occurred over the past three years, and the stock finished higher 75% of the time, with an average 10% one-month gain.

To skip the investment philosophy and details of Michael Burry’s Q2 bets, go directly to 5 Stocks To Buy According to Michael Burry.Michael Burry is one of the most prominent investors in the world. He was one of the first few to predict the subprime mortgage crisis which led to the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2009. He made a personal profit of $100 million and generated $700 million for his investors by shorting the mortgage bond market. Initially, Burry’s investors were quite pessimistic about his decision and wanted to withdraw their investments. However, Michael Burry defended himself in his third quarter 2005 investor letter by saying:“Sometimes, markets err big time. Markets erred when they gave America Online the currency to buy Time Warner. They erred when they bet against George Soros and for the British Pound. And they are erring right now by continuing to float along as if the most significant credit bubble history has ever seen does not exist. Opportunities are rare, and large opportunities on which one can put nearly unlimited capital to work at tremendous potential returns are even more rare. Selectively shorting the most problematic mortgage-backed securities in history today amounts to just such an opportunity.”Michael Burry closed his firm in 2008 after recording returns of 489.34% since its inception in 2000. Michael Burry reopened his firm by the name of Scion Asset Management in 2013. Since then, Burry has been making long-short value bets in the stock market.As of the second quarter of 2023, Michael Burry is shorting the stock market again as he purchased $886.560 million and $739 million of SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust and Invesco QQQ ETF puts, respectively. At the time of writing on the August 17 market close, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF is down by almost 4% in the last month while Invesco QQQ ETF is down by over 7% in the last month. Analysts still have mixed sentiments regarding the S&amp;P 500 (tracked by SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF). Goldman Sachs raised its end-of-year target for the S&amp;P 500 from 4,000 to 4,500, which is 4,365 at the time of writing. On the other hand, a May 23 poll by Reuters shows that 43 Wall Street strategists expect a decline by the end of the year to 4,150.Story continuesScion Asset Management Stock Bets in Q2Apart from shorting the two ETFs, Michael Burry sold out 15 stocks, most of which were bank stocks, including First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL), and Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF).

(NYSE:NEX) and Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI). According to its 13F filings, the firm's portfolio was worth approximately $1.74 billion in Q2, compared to $107 million in the previous quarter.

The home builders fooled everyone by growing their market share and making good money in the violent Fed tightening of 2022-2023.”9.

(NYSE:STLA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:“We initiated a starter position in Stellantis N.V. (NYSE:STLA), which makes Jeep, Dodge and Fiat cars. The company has a nearly 8% dividend yield with enough net cash (cash minus debt) on the balance sheet to cover the dividend for almost five years. The company trades at 1.7x operating profits, which means the market is already expecting a likely drop in cash flow. Still, the shares appear to be worth meaningfully more than where they trade, and management is heavily aligned with stockholders with a 14% stake. They share our view that the valuation is compelling, as the company plans on repurchasing ~3% of shares outstanding this year.”6.

Shares performed well in the first quarter following strong year-end business results and expectations for strong growth in 2023.We remain optimistic about the prospects for MGM because:We expect growth prospects in Las Vegas, which represent approximately 65% of the company’s cash flow, to remain strong due to strength in business group and convention activity, an increase in international visitation, and events throughout the calendar year (concerts, shows, and sports such as Formula 1 racing), which should appeal to leisure travelers…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks To Buy According to Michael Burry. Suggested articles:10 Korean Stocks Listed in the U.S.10 Best Consumer Staples ETFsStanley Druckenmiller 13F Portfolio: Top 15 StocksDisclosure.

That is because the Sep 15, 2023 $7.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Norwegian Cruise Line shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Norwegian Cruise Line is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Leisure and Recreation Services industry that ranks in the Bottom 37% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 80 cents per share to 74 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Norwegian Cruise Line right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

U.S. energy companies have been focused on regaining favor with investors after years of overspending on production growth hurt returns and put them in the doghouse.The returns focus has lifted the energy sector to about 4.5% of the S&amp;P 500's market valuation, a doubling of its weighting since 2020, but well below its 8% average.Spending on dividends and share buybacks by the top 50 U.S. independent oil and gas producers hit $58.8 billion last year, topping the $55.1 billion allocated to exploration and development, according to the EY research.Combined profits of the group, which includes shale stars such as DiamondBack Energy, Pioneer Natural Resources, and ConocoPhillips, topped $333 billion last year, a third more than the $217 billion in 2014, when U.S. spot oil prices averaged $93 per barrel.Last year's investor payouts were up substantially - 214% over 2021 and more than sevenfold over 2020 levels, the report said. Money spent on finding and tapping oil and gas also rose, but as a much slower pace.""We expect this will continue even in a high interest rate environment or a high oil price environment,"" said Bruce On, a principal in EY's strategy and transactions group. One new outlet for the cash is acquisitions, which have risen this year and could continue next, he said.Returns benefited from strong oil and gas pricing and a cost-consciousness that emerged after energy prices collapsed three years ago. Profit per barrel last year hit $32 compared to about $10 in 2014, when energy prices were about the same level as today, EY said.Energy's market weight as a percentage of the S&amp;P 500 remains below its historical average of about 8% even after doubling from three years ago.(Reporting by Gary McWilliams; Editing by David Gregorio)]"

The measure, implemented in December, was meant to limit Moscow's energy revenue, without denting global oil supply.Under the restriction, the Kremlin should not be able to rely on G7, EU, or US services when the price cap is surpassed. But despite a mid-July price breach, Western-owned and insured vessels continue to service Russia's energy trade, Bloomberg reported.40% of oil tankers subject to the cap have continued to load Russian crude since the Urals price surpassed $60 on July 12. It's a small decline from 50% of vessels that operated in Russia ahead of the threshold's breach.Meanwhile, the amount of ships covered by Western insurance dropped from 60% to 45% in the same timeframe. While a large dip, these insurers still account for a significant portion of vessels working in Russia.Part of the issue stems from how the price cap is designed to work in practice, Bloomberg said. To comply with the G7's regulation, servicing firms involved with Russian cargo must receive an attestation, or a written pledge, which establishes that the commodity was purchased below the cap.This leaves servicing firms to place full faith in a piece of paper, often with questionable validity. Though the G7 expects companies to also pursue their own due diligence, many don't, given difficulties in comparing long-term deals with immediate market prices.Story continuesOf course, the price cap only applies to firms within the G7, EU, and US coalition, and Russia is free to trade at higher prices with outside partners. And while the country's economy suffers from labor shortages and a crashing ruble, it could gain from the commodity's higher price.The country may have also profited in other ways through the price cap. According to The Financial Times, that's as Russia could have taken advantage of a loophole that allowed it to inflate its shipping costs, bringing in $1.2 billion.Read the original article on Business Insider]"

The global crude benchmark was down about 1% on the week, extending last week’s 3% drop after a seven-week rally that gave oil bulls an 18% return.The downside in crude has, however, been limited by data from oil cargo tracker Kpler that indicated a dramatic drop in crude exports from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies in the first 15 days of August.The output cuts from the so-called OPEC+ alliance, led largely by the Saudis and Russians, could take away some 67.5 million barrels from the market over the next 45 days, energy markets advisory HFI Research said at the end of last week, summing up its own calculations of Kpler data.China’s economic woes weighBut some analysts said crude was expected to stay volatile through the week and possibly end lower on weaker technicals, combined with the “China-bear” story and expectations for a hawkish Fed at Jackson Hole.Story continuesChina's renewed economic weakness has raised questions over whether its oil demand can remain resilient.Investors will particularly be looking out for a speech this week by Fed Chair Jerome Powell on how the central bank envisages interest rates going forth.Jackson Hole could provide rates guidancePowell’s speech, set for 10:05 am ET on Friday, comes after last week’s minutes of the central bank’s July meeting showed that most policymakers are still concerned about upside risks to inflation, indicating that further rate hikes cannot be ruled out.

That was a surprise to analysts who had expected cuts of 15 bps to both as recovery in the world's second-largest economy has lost steam due to a worsening property slump, weak spending and tumbling credit growth.""The small injection of stimulus by China's central bank in the ailing economy has proved largely underwhelming given the scale of the challenges erupting across sectors, but it has given investors hope there could be more to come,"" said Susannah Streeter, head of money and markets at Hargreaves Lansdown.Analysts said concern around downward pressure on the yuan, which has lost nearly 6% against the dollar this year, is likely limiting the size and scope of rate cuts.The European single currency was up 0.2% on the day at $1.0892, while the dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of currencies of other major trading partners, was down at 103.35 by 4:19 p.m. ET (2019 GMT).In commodities, Brent crude futures settled down 34 cents at $84.46, a loss of 0.4%.

Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance. Join us as we dive deep into these pivotal metrics to unravel the evolving narrative of FirstEnergy Corp.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with FE. Click here to check it out. FE 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of FEFirstEnergy Corp's Potential Underperformance: A Deep Dive into the GF Score AnalysisUnderstanding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 3/102. Profitability rank: 6/103. Growth rank: 3/104. GF Value rank: 7/105. Momentum rank: 5/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned FirstEnergy Corp the GF Score of 69 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.FirstEnergy Corp Business OverviewFirstEnergy Corp, with a market cap of $20.42 billion and sales of $12.89 billion, is an investor-owned holding company with 10 regulated distribution utilities across six mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states. The company also owns and operates one of the nation's largest electric transmission systems. With an operating margin of 16.04%, FirstEnergy Corp has established a significant presence in the Utilities - Regulated industry.FirstEnergy Corp's Potential Underperformance: A Deep Dive into the GF Score AnalysisFinancial Strength AnalysisFirstEnergy Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 2.18 positions it worse than 75.93% of 432 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. It's worth noting that the esteemed investor Benjamin Graham typically favored companies with an interest coverage ratio of at least five.Story continuesThe company's Altman Z-Score is just 0.73, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.01 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 2.28, which is worse than 89.14% of 451 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 6.22, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 74.13% of 433 companies in the Utilities - Regulated industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where FirstEnergy Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. Lastly, FirstEnergy Corp predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.FirstEnergy Corp's Potential Underperformance: A Deep Dive into the GF Score AnalysisConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While FirstEnergy Corp has a strong presence in the Utilities - Regulated industry, its financial health and growth prospects raise concerns about its ability to outperform in the future. Investors should consider these factors when making investment decisions.GuruFocus Premium members can find more companies with strong GF Scores using the following screener link: GF Score ScreenThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

(CRM): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-salesforce-inc-130011249.html,1692622811,STORY,['CRM'],"[Salesforce.com (CRM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this customer-management software developer have returned -10.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Software industry, which Salesforce.com falls in, has lost 9.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Salesforce.com is expected to post earnings of $1.90 per share, indicating a change of +59.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.44 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +42%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.01 indicates a change of +21.1% from what Salesforce.com is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Salesforce.com.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Salesforce.com, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $8.52 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.4%. For the current and next fiscal years, $34.64 billion and $38.52 billion estimates indicate +10.5% and +11.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistorySalesforce.com reported revenues of $8.25 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.3%. EPS of $1.69 for the same period compares with $0.98 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.17 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.95%. The EPS surprise was +4.97%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Salesforce.com is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers.

And if that's the case, the Nvidia hype balloon may pop.""Nvidia expectations have been steadily moving higher in recent weeks, and the investor debate appears centered on supply rather than demand,"" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy pointed out in a new client note on Tuesday.Roy added that supply concerns and its near-term impact on Nvidia's guidance are ""top of mind.""Nvidia is viewed as boasting the pole position in the AI space due to its H100 chips that power OpenAI's ChatGPT platform and other budding tech applications. The company has also inked high-profile generative AI chip deals with ServiceNow (NOW) and Snowflake (SNOW).The strong demand triggered a material upward reset in Nvidia's guidance on May 24. Nvidia said it expects second quarter revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was anticipating $7.2 billion.Nvidia's market cap exploded by $184 billion the next day as investors raced to get a piece of a rapid growth story.A sign is posted in front of the Nvidia headquarters on May 10, 2018, in Santa Clara, California.

And Wells Fargo, Baird, and Morgan Stanley got the pre-earnings excitement going with bullish notes of their own last week, Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reported.""Last quarter's guidance was pretty astonishing,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""I had to look at the number twice. I couldn't register it in my brain, and I've been doing this job a fairly long time. I've never seen a guide like that from an established, at-scale company like we saw. So that was pretty unbelievable.""Story continuesNvidia stock is up 15% in the last week alone, bringing the year-to-date gain to 221%.But chip supply uncertainty must at least be acknowledged by the Nvidia bulls, as it's very real.VentureBeat reported that power players in tech such as Oracle (ORCL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) may want hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's H100 chips. The insatiable demand for the chips is spurring shortage fears in Silicon Valley, and possibly limiting Nvidia's top line in the near-term.""Who’s getting how many H100s and when is top gossip of the valley [right now],"" posted tech insider and top data scientist Andrej Karpathy on X, formerly known as Twitter, earlier this month.Nvidia bull Rasgon acknowledged the problem as a top risk too.""Supply is very limited, so customers can't get what they want,"" Rasgon explained. ""And there's a general behavior that happens in semiconductors and lots of other places, it's called double ordering. When people can't get what they want, they order more.""""And with Nvidia, that's one of the primary controversies is this new level of demand that we see, is that sort of the new baseline for growth? Or is it like pull forward and panic buying and is there an air pocket?"" Rasgon continued. ""And look, at some point, what is the chance that Nvidia will see an air pocket? It's probably 100%.

The CMA has set a new deadline of Oct. 18 for an initial ruling.The CMA’s reversal follows a series of dramatic twists and turns. The proposed takeover was thought moribund after running up against concerns from a number of antitrust watchdogs, but gained unexpected momentum after Microsoft beat the Federal Trade Commission’s court challenge over the deal. The European Union cleared the deal with behavioral remedies in May. That left the CMA, which blocked the transaction in April, as the only hurdle.The revised deal grants Ubisoft exclusive streaming rights outside of the European Economic Area of all Activision Blizzard titles, including Call of Duty, for the next 15 years. Inside the bloc, Ubisoft gets non-exclusive streaming rights to the same titles.Financial terms of the deal weren’t disclosed. But the CMA said the transaction is intended to provide an independent third-party content supplier with the ability to supply Activision’s gaming content, including hit games like Call of Duty, to other cloud-gaming service providers.That would include Microsoft itself and Amazon.com Inc.’s Luna, which competes with Microsoft’s Xbox. Ubisoft has its own cloud streaming service known as Ubisoft+, which costs $14.99 a month for access to more than 100 PC games. The regulator also said Ubisoft would be able to require Microsoft to provide versions of games on operating systems other than Windows. In theory, Ubisoft could force Microsoft to make a version of Call of Duty for Apple Inc.’s cloud streaming platform, for example.Story continuesMicrosoft rose less than 1% in New York and Activision gained about 1% to $91.70. While that’s lower than Microsoft’s $95 offer price, the gap has been narrowing, suggesting the market expects the deal to ultimately close. Ubisoft, which owns the Assassin’s Creed franchise, jumped 9% in Paris.The CMA had consistently expressed concern that the combination would choke off competition in cloud gaming, a corner of the market where the regulator sees gaming heading in the future, though there is still skepticism about its mass appeal. The CMA concluded early on that under Microsoft, Activision wouldn’t have enough incentive to seed its games across multiple services.Read More: Microsoft’s $69 Billion Deal Upended by Gaming Niche“We had a real concern previously that Microsoft would be able to control the way that that market was going to develop,” Sarah Cardell, chief executive officer of the CMA, said in an interview on Bloomberg Radio. “What we see with this new deal, and we will have to test it carefully through our review, is that rather than Microsoft being able to control how those cloud streaming rights are used, that control will shift to an independent company.”The cloud gaming market is expected to grow to $8.2 billion by the end of 2025, from an estimated $2.4 billion at the end of 2022, according to gaming analytic firm NewZoo. That compares with the total video game market of about $183 billion.Read More: Boost for Ubisoft as Microsoft Concedes Cloud Streaming RightsMicrosoft asked the UK regulator in July to reconsider its April veto on the grounds that the situation had “materially changed,” given the US court decision and a subsequent deal it reached to license Activision blockbuster title Call of Duty to rival Sony Group Corp.“Under the restructured transaction, Microsoft will not be in a position either to release Activision Blizzard games exclusively on its own cloud streaming service — Xbox Cloud Gaming – or to exclusively control the licensing terms of Activision Blizzard games for rival services,” Microsoft said in its own statement.Microsoft said it will still be able to acquire the rights it needs to honor its obligations in the European Economic Area, where it struck deals with other streaming providers to satisfy commitments to the European Commission. In an effort to clear the deal, earlier this year Microsoft struck licensing deals with several cloud gaming services including Nvidia Corp.’s GeForceNow and Boosteroid.Ubisoft will make a one-off payment to compensate Microsoft for the rights in addition to a “market-based wholesale pricing mechanism” that will support pricing based on usage.Activision Chief Executive Officer Bobby Kotick said in a letter to employees that, “For us, nothing substantially changes with the addition of this divestiture. Our merger agreement with Microsoft, closing deadline, and the cash consideration to be paid for each Activision Blizzard share at closing remain the same.”The CMA has said it prefers structural remedies to address concerns about mergers that hinder competition. To satisfy that preference, Microsoft and Activision have been seeking a divestiture that wins over regulators without harming what Microsoft considers the key parts of the acquisition. The software giant has publicly ruled out selling the Call of Duty franchise, for example.--With assistance from Stephen Carroll, Jason Schreier and Cecilia D'Anastasio.(Updates shares prices in sixth paragraph and context on Ubisoft throughout)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekUS Budget Deficits Are Exploding Like Never BeforeThe Next Wave of Scams Will Be Deepfake Video Calls From Your BossLyme Disease Has Exploded, and a New Vaccine Is (Almost) HereStock Pickers Never Had a Chance Against Hard Math of the MarketSorry, But LinkedIn Is Cool Now©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

In July, after a US judge declined the Federal Trade Commission’s (FTC) request to pause the deal for the duration of its antitrust challenge, the CMA agreed to reopen negotiations with Microsoft.The Federal Trade Commission has backed down from its separate decision to challenge the tie-up over concerns that it would give Microsoft an unfair advantage in cloud gaming, gaming subscription services, and gaming consoles.Twitter post from Microsoft president Brad Smith on Aug. 22, 2023 (Twitter /.

To skip the investment philosophy and details of Michael Burry’s Q2 bets, go directly to 5 Stocks To Buy According to Michael Burry.Michael Burry is one of the most prominent investors in the world. He was one of the first few to predict the subprime mortgage crisis which led to the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2009. He made a personal profit of $100 million and generated $700 million for his investors by shorting the mortgage bond market. Initially, Burry’s investors were quite pessimistic about his decision and wanted to withdraw their investments. However, Michael Burry defended himself in his third quarter 2005 investor letter by saying:“Sometimes, markets err big time. Markets erred when they gave America Online the currency to buy Time Warner. They erred when they bet against George Soros and for the British Pound. And they are erring right now by continuing to float along as if the most significant credit bubble history has ever seen does not exist. Opportunities are rare, and large opportunities on which one can put nearly unlimited capital to work at tremendous potential returns are even more rare. Selectively shorting the most problematic mortgage-backed securities in history today amounts to just such an opportunity.”Michael Burry closed his firm in 2008 after recording returns of 489.34% since its inception in 2000. Michael Burry reopened his firm by the name of Scion Asset Management in 2013. Since then, Burry has been making long-short value bets in the stock market.As of the second quarter of 2023, Michael Burry is shorting the stock market again as he purchased $886.560 million and $739 million of SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust and Invesco QQQ ETF puts, respectively. At the time of writing on the August 17 market close, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF is down by almost 4% in the last month while Invesco QQQ ETF is down by over 7% in the last month. Analysts still have mixed sentiments regarding the S&amp;P 500 (tracked by SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF). Goldman Sachs raised its end-of-year target for the S&amp;P 500 from 4,000 to 4,500, which is 4,365 at the time of writing.

The company trades at 1.7x operating profits, which means the market is already expecting a likely drop in cash flow. Still, the shares appear to be worth meaningfully more than where they trade, and management is heavily aligned with stockholders with a 14% stake.

Shares performed well in the first quarter following strong year-end business results and expectations for strong growth in 2023.We remain optimistic about the prospects for MGM because:We expect growth prospects in Las Vegas, which represent approximately 65% of the company’s cash flow, to remain strong due to strength in business group and convention activity, an increase in international visitation, and events throughout the calendar year (concerts, shows, and sports such as Formula 1 racing), which should appeal to leisure travelers…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks To Buy According to Michael Burry. Suggested articles:10 Korean Stocks Listed in the U.S.10 Best Consumer Staples ETFsStanley Druckenmiller 13F Portfolio: Top 15 StocksDisclosure.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the economic contributions of the Hispanic or Latino community and head over directly to the 5 Cities with the Most Hispanics.Hispanics are Americans who trace their roots to Spain, Mexico, Latin America, and the Spanish-speaking islands of the Caribbean. They are the largest racial or ethnic minority in the United States – with an estimated population of 62.9 million as of July 2021 according to the Census Bureau – which equates to 18.9% of the total population in the country.A 2022 report by the Joint Economic Committee stated the total economic output of the Hispanic or Latino population of the United States to be an estimated $2 trillion. This includes five-million businesses that contribute $800 billion every year to the national economy. Number of Hispanic-owned businesses between 2012 and 2017 in the country grew by 14%, which was more than twice the national average. According to McKinsey &amp; Company, they also account for the fastest growing portion of the United States GDP. So much so that if the American Latinos had a country of their own, they would have the third highest GDP growth in the past decade after China and India.California, Texas, Florida, Arizona and New Mexico are the states with the highest Hispanic population. These states also have the highest concentration of Latino-owned businesses. In California, 85,000 of the total 764,000 businesses are owned by Hispanics or Latinos, which is equivalent to over 11% of all businesses in the state. These businesses provide jobs to an estimated 670,000 people and contribute $25 billion towards the state economy. These figures were shared by the Latino Policy and Politics Institute in August 2023.Hispanic Representation in Leading CompaniesDespite making up nearly one-fifths of the overall population of the US, Hispanics are underrepresented in boards of Fortune 500 companies and C-suites of corporate America – with less than 5% of top management positions in companies being held by Hispanics. Only 1% of all board seats are held by Latina women. 69% of the Fortune 1000 companies in 2021 did not have a single director from a Hispanic background. Only 20 of Fortune 500 companies had CEOs of Hispanic descent.Story continuesThis includes Juan Ricardo Luciano, the CEO of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), which is a food processing and commodities trading company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) was ranked 35th in the 2023 Fortune 500 list, having a revenue of $101 billion in 2022. Luciano grew up in Argentina and studied engineering at the Buenos Aires Institute of Technology. He worked 25 years for Dow Chemical before taking over as the CEO of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) in 2015.One of the world’s most diversified and largest healthcare products companies, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is also headed by a Latino, Joaquin Duato, who is the CEO and Chairman of the Board at the company. Duato joined Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) 34 years ago and served as the Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee before becoming CEO in 2022. During the coronavirus pandemic, Duato spearheaded Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)’s efforts in ensuring employee health and that life-saving medicines including the company’s Covid-19 vaccine reached those who were in need.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)’s Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta, was born in Spain and completed his undergraduate and master’s degrees from the ESADE Business School in Barcelona. He is the first Spanish to be the chief executive officer of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and has held the position since 2018. Laguarta previously oversaw PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)’s operations in Europe and Africa before moving to the United States.MethodologyWe have ranked 20 cities with the most Hispanics using figures released by the Census Bureau in its 2021 American Community Survey (ACS).

59,7f0e0675-2d13-3070-92b3-9ea9e04eeb9e,ADM,2023-08-22,The 7 Most Undervalued Large-Cap Stocks to Buy Now: August 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-undervalued-large-cap-100007519.html,1692180007,STORY,"['ABI', 'CSCO', 'CVS', 'CVX', 'HAL', 'ADM', 'TAP-A']","[Contrary to what we’ve heard about a lot of bis stocks topping out, now is a great time to find undervalued large-cap stocks.The S&amp;P 500 stalled as August came around. After rallying 20% higher over the first seven months of 2023, the index of the 500 largest stocks on the market is down 2.5% so far this month. Even after the gains, the benchmark index remains 7% below its all-time high. That means if you know where to look you’ll find undervalued large-cap stocks worth your consideration.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDespite the market’s push higher in 2023, the following seven undervalued large-cap stocks still look ripe for the picking. You just might want to consider buying them now before the trade winds begin blowing again. Once their sails fill, their valuations won’t be nearly as attractive as they are right now, so take a good look at some of these undervalued large-cap stocks.CVS Health (CVS)Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comShares of pharmacy chain CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) are down 30% from last year because of worries about a recession and fears of legal exposure to the opioid crisis. It was alleged the pharmacy failed to oversee the dispensing of opioids from its stores. CVS has since agreed to pay $5 billion over 10 years.Coupled with its double-digit growth in its pharmacy benefit management business and robust growth still in pharmacy sales, CVS Health is deeply discounted at just eight times next year’s earnings estimates, a fraction of its sales, and an incredible five times the free cash flow it produces. This is one of the undervalued large-cap stocks that’s a no-brainer.Cisco Systems (CSCO)cisco (CSCO) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comLong considered the backbone of the internet, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has evolved into so much more today. But the blue chip tech stock has also struggled as a result. The rise of Zoom Video and Microsoft Teams meant businesses relied less on its conferencing hardware. Cybersecurity remains a threat to corporations, but they’re not spending as much as they were previously. That resulted in softer sales for Cisco’s end-to-end security services. Story continuesSupply chain disruptions also made it harder for Cisco to obtain materials for its routers, switches, and other networking hardware.The situation is normalizing, though. Growth is returning. Revenue is up 9% year to date with adjusted earnings 7% higher from last year. Cisco expects adjusted earnings to be 13% higher for the full year.Even though the stock isn’t battered like CVS’s, it’s still one of the big-name undervalued large-cap stocks out there. They trade at 13 times next year’s estimates and the free cash flow it generates. With a dividend that yields 2.9% annually, Cisco is a large-cap stock to buy.Molson Coors Beverage (TAP)Molson Coors (TAP) logo on a web browser magnified by a magnifying glassSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.comBrewer Molson Coors Beverage (NYSE:TAP) realized the secular decline in beer drinking meant it needed to broaden its portfolio. It now includes hard seltzers, ready to drink beverage,s and a variety of non-alcoholic beverage offerings. The company also signified the change by renaming itself from Molson Coors Brewing to Molson Coors Beverage.Beer still drives the brewer’s revenue, but it’s taking a more holistic look at drinks. For example, it just acquired Blue Run Spirits, a distiller of premium bourbon and rye whiskies.Molson Coors is also capitalizing on the problems of its rivals. The marketing debacle of Anheuser-Busch InBev saw its No. 1 selling Bud Light brand topple to fourth place. While Constellation Brands Corona beer is now the top-selling beer, Molson Coors arguably is faring best. According to data from Union, a hospitality market firm, Miller Lite beer was launched into the top spot in restaurants and bars with a 20.7% sales gain in June. Coors Light surged to the No. 3 position with a 19.4% sales jump.The stock goes for only 11 times free cash flow and it offers a dividend yielding 2.6% annually.Chevron (CVX)Chevron Earnings: CVX Stock Sinks Amid Spending CutsSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comShares of integrated oil and gas giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) are down 9% in 2023. The stock trades at just 10 times trailing earnings and 11 times next year’s estimates. The decline in oil prices had some big investors running for the exits in June. They bailed too soon.Where West Texas Intermediate oil had fallen to $70 a barrel it’s since rebounded to $82 a barrel as of this writing. Brent crude is also up $10 to $86 a barrel. Demand hit a record high in July and is expected to spike further this year.Chevron is in the driver’s seat here. It possesses superior financial rigor with a strong balance sheet that could withstand a drop in oil prices to $50 a barrel and still be profitable.The oil giant also just completed the acquisition of PDC Energy (NYSE:PDC) for $7.6 billion in an all-stock deal. That will boost Chevron’s proved oil equivalent reserves by 10% for less than $7 per barrel.Look for this large-cap stock to rally higher as the oil boom returns.Halliburton (HAL)photo of Halliburton (HAL) logo in red on building with truck in frontSource: hkhtt hj / Shutterstock.comIn that same vein is oil and gas services behemoth Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) to jump higher as well. CEO Jeff Miller believed it was inevitable there would be a resurgence in oil demand. “It’s clear to me that oil and gas is in short supply, and only multiple years of increased investment in both stemming declines and reserve additions will solve short supply. I believe these investments will drive demand for oilfield services for the next several years,” he told investors earlier this year. Halliburton provides services to oil and gas companies drilling wells. It is responsible for most of the hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operations in the U.S. As Miller also notes, “the fact is operators don’t produce more without fracking wells.”Halliburton stock is also cheap at 15 times trailing earnings and 11 times estimates. Analysts also expect the industry services firm to grow earnings almost 24% annually for the next five years. That means the stock trades at just a fraction of those growth rates and is a bargain at these levels.JD.com (JD)JD stock, Jd.com, Tiger Global is a major investor in JDSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comI’ll admit I’m leery of investing in Chinese companies. The political uncertainty surrounding Beijing and global geopolitical tensions can make it a crapshoot. But online retailer JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is the exception that proves the rule.JD.com and sister e-tailer Alibaba fell hard from their 2021 highs due to a crackdown by China’s government into tech stocks. With the investigations winding down or over with, the online retailers have room to grow again.JD.com hosts the Chinese midyear shopping extravaganza known as 618 (June 18). It was first launched in 2004 to celebrate the retailer’s founding. This year the spectacle ran from the end of May through mid-June. JD.com did not release gross merchandise value sold, but said it was a record. Analysts estimate it rose 6% to 8% more than the $56 billion worth it sold last year.The online retailer’s stock is down 34% in 2023 and it’s trading at just fractions of its estimated earnings growth rate and sales. That makes it a cheap stock with plenty of upside ahead.Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) logo on sign at office campusSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comAfter hitting a 52-week low of $70 a share in June, agricultural products processor Archer-Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) has rallied 21% higher. It’s still 13% below its highs, but there’s good reason to think it will continue its march higher. In short, people have to eat.ADM processes oilseeds into vegetable oils and other food products. It also converts corn and wheat into products and ingredients used in food and beverages, some of which are used to make ethanol. It also makes flavors and additives for food, including animal food.Skyrocketing commodity prices boosted ADM’s business and its profits. It reported record earnings of $7.85 per share in 2022. With inflation cooling off, ADM is witnessing a return to the mean, which brought down the stock.A rebound is underway. Bloomberg Intelligence data indicates fuel demand is rising as prices fell. And cheaper grain made it more profitable to make ethanol. Reportedly profits surged by 70% this year to $0.80 per gallon.In addition to strong tailwinds, Archer-Daniels Midland is a Dividend King. It has a better than 50-year record of raising its dividend, which yields 2.1% currently. It has a payout ratio of just 24%, meaning there is plenty of room for further increases with sufficient safety.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in CVX stock.

64,eeb30518-bd07-30b2-9947-ee812a618f09,LUV,2023-08-22,FOCUS-US airline pilots fight their unions to increase retirement age,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-us-airline-pilots-fight-100000929.html,1692698400,STORY,"['UAL', 'LUV']","[By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Allison LampertAug 22 (Reuters) - Bo Ellis has been a devoted member of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) for nearly four decades, but the 64-year-old is waging a campaign against the union to extend his flying career.ALPA and other pilot unions oppose a bill in the U.S. Congress that seeks to raise the retirement age for commercial airline pilots to 67 from 65, arguing it will ""introduce new risk"" into the aviation system as no safety agency has studied its implications.The measure, however, is estimated to provide 5,000 pilots like Ellis the option to continue working over the next two years, according to the Regional Airline Association (RAA).Increasing the age limit by two years would also align pilot retirement with the minimum federal retirement age, allowing them to receive full social security benefits.Ellis, a head pilot at a U.S. carrier, said senior pilots are ""by far much safer"" due to experience, accusing ALPA of ""politicizing"" safety.""My own union is being discriminatory against me,"" he said.PILOTS LOBBY LAWMAKERSEllis has co-founded a coalition of thousands of pilots at carriers including Delta, United, American and Southwest Airlines to lobby for the legislation and has contacted over 200 lawmakers.In a statement, ALPA said it ""carefully"" considered and its elected representatives voted ""unanimously"" last October to reaffirm its opposition to an ""arbitrary change"" in the retirement age.""America did not establish the aviation safety gold standard by cutting corners when making significant changes to our complex, global aviation system,"" ALPA said.Rick Redfern, a Mesa Air pilot who was present at ALPA's October meeting, said the union's board merely approved its strategic plan which contains its position on age. But the specific question of increasing the retirement age to 67 was never brought to the floor for a vote. Two other pilots, present at the meeting, confirmed Redfern's account.Story continuesInternal emails reviewed by Reuters and interviews with a dozen pilots show members are divided over the age issue. Some of the pilots asked not to have their employers identified due to the risk of losing their jobs.In previously unreported developments, a proposal by Mesa pilots seeking a vote on the age limit is expected to be discussed at ALPA's national executive council in September, said Redfern.ALPA needs to ""get the pulse of the community,"" said Redfern, an ALPA representative for MESA pilots.Similarly, ALPA's unit at United Airlines is polling pilots on the issue for the first time in 16 years.""We are fully aware of the passion raised over the issue,"" ALPA said in an Aug. 3 memo to United pilots that was seen by Reuters.The measure, expected to be taken up by the U.S. Senate in September after its approval in the House of Representatives last month, can mitigate staffing gaps at carriers that have led to a reduction in air service to more than 300 U.S. airports.""It will provide some much-needed relief,"" said airline stocks analyst Savanthi Syth of Raymond James.JUNIOR VERSUS SENIOR PILOTSAll airline pilots are required to pass medical tests every six months and those older than 40 must undergo ECG heart screening annually. Additionally, all pilots have their skills regularly evaluated in flight simulators to ensure proficiency.Advocates of the measure said advancements in medical science have led to a better understanding of pilot incapacitation. They point to Canada, Japan and Australia, countries with either higher or no age limit for pilots.Also, pilots are allowed to fly corporate and charter jets beyond the age of 65.Take Dan Carr, a former Mesa captain who turned 66 this month and flies business jets. If he was allowed to retire at 67, Carr said he would have never left Mesa.""I feel like I'm at the pinnacle of my ability,"" he said.Some older pilots want to work longer to benefit from salary increases after enduring economic losses in the coronavirus pandemic during 2020-2021 and various airline bankruptcies.They accused union leaders of pandering to junior pilots, who outnumber senior aviators and fear a higher retirement age would hurt their career progression.""This is a coup by junior pilots against senior pilots,"" said Allen Baker, who retired as a United Airlines pilot in June.ALPA said its stand on age is the result of a ""democratic process"" and reflects ""the will"" of its members.Baker, 65, shared an email with Reuters which he wrote to ALPA leadership at United weeks before his retirement, complaining about a ""slander campaign"" by junior pilots against senior members like him.Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for American Airlines pilots union, said pilots seeking higher retirement age want to keep earning longer.DIVIDED AIRLINESALPA said changes to aviation policy should not be done ""in the backrooms of Congress or at the behest of moneyed special interests."" It has warned the move could cause airline scheduling and pilot training issues, and require reopening pilot contracts as current international rules would still prevent pilots older than 65 from flying internationally.In an interview, ALPA head Jason Ambrosi said the measure would drive up airline costs and ticket prices for customers. He, however, did not provide any specific data to back his argument.Like pilots, airlines are also split. Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said pilots should be allowed to fly as long as they clear their medical tests, joining the global airline trade group, International Air Transport Association and the RAA, in supporting the legislation.But United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has said lifting the retirement age would not solve the pilot shortage. Last year, he said 36% of the company's pilots aged 64 were out on sick, long-term, or short-term medical leave.Mesa's CEO Jonathan Ornstein said he would love to have pilots like former Mesa employee Carr fly longer. The airline's operations are suffering as it has lost 37% of its captains due to retirement and attrition since early 2022.""If the regulations permitted, I'd take them all back,"" he said.

This latest release brings significant enhancements to Expert Billing, including new and improved features for the Paperless Billing module, and integration with Onyx, Aderant's new Outside Counsel Guidelines (OCG) management solution powered by its AI, MADDI. This update underscores Aderant's ongoing commitment to evolving the Expert product line, ensuring it meets the multifaceted demands of the modern legal sector.Bolstering Paperless Billing CapabilitiesIn recent years, the legal industry has experienced a paradigm shift, with law firms transitioning en masse from traditional paper-based billing to paperless systems. Aderant's Expert Paperless Billing is at the heart of this change, aiding law firms in their digital transformation journey. Moving away from printing endless paper bills and waiting for partners to manually review and edit them, firms can now automate the entire bill preparation and approval process. With the complete elimination of manual data entry, bills are processed more swiftly and accurately. Hundreds of law firms worldwide have adopted Aderant’s Expert Paperless Billing solution.""Our focus is clear: offering law firms a seamless journey from paper-based chaos to streamlined digital efficiency,"" said Aderant’s Chief Executive Officer Chris Cartrett. ""Central to our ethos is the belief that law partners should be empowered to work more efficiently, saving their precious time and expediting the billing cycle. Our latest enhancements cater precisely to these needs, focusing on making bill review and editing more intuitive, fostering better communication between partners and other bill reviewers, and providing increased visibility and tracking. These improvements are instrumental in saving partners’ time and effort, enabling faster payments, and reducing costs.""Story continuesKey Enhancements to Expert Paperless Billing as part of the Expert 8.2 SP3 rollout:1. Make Bill Review and Editing More Intuitive:Aderant introduces the new Paperless Billing Inbox, designed to augment billing partners' productivity. This centralized interface allows for seamless management of all billing tasks and prebills. Advanced searching and sorting features enable users to effortlessly locate prebills based on specific client, matter, or bill attributes. With multi-column sorting, users can organize tasks in their desired sequence.2. Foster Better Communication and Collaboration:Sharing and communication have been given a significant upgrade. Partners can now seamlessly share tasks, monitoring reviews, all the while retaining full ownership of the tasks. Complementing this is the new Bill Notes feature, designed to facilitate communication between partners and other bill reviewers. This means faster approvals, reduced back-and-forth, and a more synchronized billing team.3. Provide Increased Visibility and Tracking:Understanding the nuances of every billing modification is vital. The new Bill Summary screen, directly accessible from the Prebill List, presents users with a quick summary of all changes made to a prebill. This enhances transparency, streamlines workflows, and reduces potential billing disputes.Ensuring Compliance with Outside Counsel Billing GuidelinesAnother notable advancement within Expert is its integration with Aderant's Onyx – the industry's first end-to-end OCG compliance platform. Powered by Aderant's AI, MADDI, Onyx automates the entire compliance process from extracting OCG terms to enforcing time and billing rules across all checkpoints. With this development, Expert users can now better manage time and billing rules, utilizing them to validate prebills and bills at the points of entry, effectively reducing bill rejections and deductions.Doug Matthews, Chief Product Officer (CPO) at Aderant, noted, ""The release of Onyx has brought about a transformative change in how law firms manage compliance. We're excited to bring this capability to Expert users through a tight integration between Expert and Onyx. By leveraging the combined capabilities of Expert and Onyx, firms can ensure compliance at a lower cost while enhancing coordination across multiple functions. Ultimately, this contributes to simplifying billing processes and expediting compensation for law firms.""""We are dedicated to consistently improving the experience of our Expert users,"" said Matthews.

67,541f6933-c561-3bdd-864f-3e23baa1b9f5,WU,2023-08-22,Affirm (AFRM) to Post Q4 Earnings: What You Should Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/affirm-afrm-post-q4-earnings-143600749.html,1692628560,STORY,"['AFRM', 'MA', 'V', 'WU']","[Affirm Holdings, Inc. AFRM is set to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 24, after the closing bell.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 loss per share of 86 cents suggests a 32.3% plunge from the prior-year loss of 65 cents. The estimate remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues of $404.2 million indicates an 11% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Affirm beat on earnings in one of the trailing four quarters and missed thrice, the average negative surprise being 8.5%. This is depicted in the graph below.Affirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Affirm Holdings, Inc. QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at AFRM’s previous-quarter performance first.Q3 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, this leading payment network’s adjusted loss per share of 69 cents was 24.2% narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, thanks to improved virtual card network revenues and interest income. However, the positives were partially offset by deteriorated servicing and merchant network revenues and rising operating expenses.Now, let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement.Q4 Factors to NoteThe company expects the weighted average shares outstanding to be 300 million in the to-be-reported quarter. Travel and entertainment-related spendings are expected to have been resilient in the quarter under review. This, in turn, is likely to have augmented the strength of active merchants and consumers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for merchant network revenues is pegged at $130.1 million, indicating a jump of 10.1% from a year ago. Also, the consensus mark for servicing income indicates a 4.4% year-over-year increase to $22.5 million.The sales figures from the virtual card networks are anticipated to have risen. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for virtual card network revenues is pegged at $32.6 million, indicating a 3.3% year-over-year rise. Affirm anticipates fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 GMV to be $5.20-$5.35 billion, signaling a jump from $4.4 billion a year ago.Story continuesThe consensus mark for interest income in the fiscal fourth quarter is pegged at $186.6 million, indicating a 35.6% jump from the previous-year quarter’s $137.6 million, primarily due to the high interest rate environment.The above-mentioned factors are expected to have positioned the company for year-over-year top-line growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. However, the positives are likely to have been partially offset by lower gains on sales of loans and higher operating costs.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for gain on sales of loans suggests a 41.5% year-over-year decline to $32.4 million. The company expects transaction costs to be within $245-$255 million, significantly higher than the year-ago level of $179.8 million.Also, operating costs are likely to have increased in the quarter under review due to higher technology and data analytics, and funding costs, affecting the bottom line. Increased processing and servicing costs, as a result of growing volumes, are anticipated to have boosted the operating costs, reducing profits and making an earnings beat uncertain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Affirm this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company currently has an Earnings ESP of -18.15%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at a loss of $1.02 per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 86 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Affirm currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.How Other Stocks PerformedHere are some companies from the Business Services space that have already reported earnings for the June quarter: Mastercard Incorporated MA, Visa Inc. V and The Western Union Company WU.Mastercard reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.89 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.8%. The quarterly results gained from strong consumer spending, specifically across the travel sector, and an enhanced services suite. Robust growth in cross-border volume also contributed to the upside. However, the performance was partly offset by an escalating operating cost level.Visa reported third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings of $2.16 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.4%. Its solid quarterly results benefited from higher payments, cross-border volumes and processed transactions. Steady cross-border travel growth and higher-than-expected data processing aided the results, partially offset by increased costs.Western Union reported second-quarter 2023 earnings per share of 51 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 34.2%. WU’s earnings were supported by growth in business originating from Iraq, inflation in Argentina and better-than-expected C2C transactions. Evolve 2025’s momentum and strength in the Middle East business further benefited the results, partially offset by higher expenses.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, slow demand recovery may impact its performance.The company’s shares are up 4.2% year to date, compared with 1.6% decline recorded by its industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Higher Opteon Demand and Cost Actions Aid ChemoursChemours, a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, is gaining from strong execution and its cost-reduction and pricing actions. Its Thermal &amp; Specialized Solutions segment is benefiting from healthy demand in refrigerants. It is witnessing strong adoption of the Opteon platform. The company remains committed toward driving Opteon adoption. Higher prices are also contributing to the segment’s sales.Chemours is also gaining from its efforts to reduce costs. Its cost-reduction program along with its productivity and operational improvement actions across its businesses are expected to support its margins in 2023. It is also taking appropriate pricing measures to counter cost inflation in raw materials.The company also remains focused on boosting its cash flows and returning value to shareholders. It generated cash from operating activities of $754 million and free cash flow of $447 million in 2022. It also paid dividends worth $154 million and returned $495 million through share repurchases during the year. CC also repurchased $37 million of common stock and paid dividends worth $38 million in the second quarter of 2023. It expects to generate free cash flow of more than $325 million in 2023.Demand Softness a ConcernIn the Advanced Performance Materials segment, the company is seeing improved demand in the performance solutions portfolio. However, continued softness in advanced materials is likely to weigh on volumes in this segment. Demand is expected to remain weak in advanced materials for products that serve economically sensitive end markets. The company’s shift to higher value and differentiated products has also resulted in weaker demand in non-strategic end markets. Chemours sees weaker demand in advanced materials in second-half 2023.While destocking in China and Europe has largely ended, the pace of demand recovery is expected to be modest over the near term, given the weak global economic recovery and continued macroeconomic uncertainties. This is likely to adversely impact volumes in the Titanium Technologies segment in the third quarter.Chemours’ top line, in the second quarter, was hurt by lower sales in the Titanium Technologies segment and the advanced materials portfolio of the Advanced Performance Materials division.The company updated its adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2023 factoring in weaker demand visibility in the second half of 2023. It now anticipates adjusted EBITDA for 2023 to be between $1.100 billion and $1.175 billion, down from its prior view of $1.20 billion and $1.30 billion.Story continues The Chemours Company Price and Consensus The Chemours Company Price and ConsensusThe Chemours Company price-consensus-chart | The Chemours Company Quote Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks worth a look in the basic materials space include Carpenter Technology Corporation CRS, PPG Industries, Inc.

However, it faces headwinds from weak fertilizer prices.The company’s shares are down 28.6% over a year compared with a 32.8% decline recorded by its industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s find out why this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining at the moment. Strong Demand, Cost Actions Aid MOSMosaic is benefiting from strong demand for phosphate and potash. Higher agricultural commodity prices and attractive farm economics are driving demand for fertilizers globally. Farmer economics remains attractive in most global growing regions on strong crop demand, affordable inputs, and favorable weather.Demand for grains and oilseeds remains high along with strong farm economics. Strong agricultural commodity pricing trends and improved farmer affordability are likely to drive demand for fertilizers in the balance of 2023. Strong demand is expected to support the company’s sales volumes.Mosaic is also taking actions to reduce costs amid a still-challenging operating environment. Its actions to improve its operating cost structure through transformation plans are expected to boost profitability.The company also remains committed to carrying out investments with high returns with moderate capital expenditures, such as the expansion of MicroEssentials capacity at its Riverview facility, constructing a new blending and distribution center in Palmeirante, Brazil, executing the construction of a purified phosphoric acid plant for sale in North Americ, and installing a Hydrofloat flotation system at Esterhazy's K2 mill. The estimated total capital expenditures for 2023 are $1.3-$1.4 billion.Mosaic also aims to return substantial free cash flow in 2023 to shareholders. The company strives to maintain a healthy balance sheet.Weak Prices AilSofter potash and phosphate prices may impact the company’s margins. Prices of phosphate and potash retreated since the back half of 2022 from their peak levels attained in the first half riding on the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war and disruptions due to the sanctions in Belarus. Lower selling prices hurt sales and margins across the company’s Phosphate and Potash segments in the second quarter of 2023. Despite some recovery of late, weaker year-over-year fertilizer prices are expected weigh on the company’s profitability.Story continues The Mosaic Company Price and Consensus The Mosaic Company Price and ConsensusThe Mosaic Company price-consensus-chart | The Mosaic Company Quote Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks worth a look in the basic materials space include Carpenter Technology Corporation CRS, PPG Industries, Inc.

Goldman Sachs Chief Information Officer Marco Argenti sits down with Yahoo Finance Live's Julie Hyman to discuss Goldman Sachs' (GS) progress in developing and adapting artificial intelligence to accurately summarize all categories of data for investors.""You can ask very complex questions that span multiple elements, multiple factors,"" Argenti says. ""It could be macrofactors, microfactors, your own research, your own data, and this comes into hypothesis, comes into something that really connects those dots in a way that is almost like it's very human, but in a way it's superhuman.""Argenti also related what he learned from his time as Amazon Web Services (AMZN) vice president of technology to his strategic direction he is envisioning for Goldman Sachs' AI products.Video TranscriptJULIE HYMAN: So where are you in Goldman's-- inside Goldman Sachs in this process of incorporating some of these new technologies? And what is your process? I know you have a big engineering staff.MARCO ARGENTI: We definitely have a pretty sizable engineering staff. And we're really looking forward to technologists really to be in the driver's seat to lead this revolution of AI. In terms of where we are, right now, we're conducting a number of what we call proof of concepts. And in some cases, those are actually starting to be expanded and extended to quite a bit of people within the firm.The first one being the developer productivity, as I mentioned. But we're also working, for example, on the summarization of large quantities of data into the hands of the people that consume that data every day.So we've enabled, let's say, natural language queries interfaces where we can ask-- people can ask really complex questions, such as given the earnings of this company, give me all the companies that might be impacted by this particular things that was reported or, for example, by a hypothesis that exchange rates might go in a certain direction. So you state your hypothesis, and then the AI will bring information to you.Story continuesThey really connect the dots and really summarizes it in something actionable. I think this is really the power of AI, which is, it has an uncanny ability to fill the blanks. For example, if you have incomplete information, it can really effectively fill the blanks and actually give you a good trajectory, like the next level of interpolation.And then the second part is really connecting the dots. You can ask very complex questions that span multiple elements, multiple factors. It could be macro factors, micro factor, your own research, your own data. And this comes into a hypothesis, comes into something that really connect those dots in a way that is almost like it's very human, but in a way superhuman because it processes this incredible amounts of information.And then the summarization. It can give you-- like imagine, for example, a banker wakes up, gets an email that says-- from an AI and says, this just happened in the world. This might impact the following clients. These are the three talking points that you should tell them. And it's very pointed, very--JULIE HYMAN: And how far away are we from that?MARCO ARGENTI: I think we're actually not that far away from that. And right now, the challenge is really-- and for us, it's been a big focus, is how to make it safe in the sense that the information is actually correct and accurate. Because AIs started as very plausible answer engine. It gives you things that sounds really, really good. But then sometimes, they turn out to be incorrect.And so we've done a lot of work to really make sure that you merge the ability to produce content with the ability to actually retrieve content, and then cross-check it and make sure that it's correct. And so that is a very important part. And I think the state of the art is moving really, really fast. And so I think we're getting very close to have something that is nothing short than a revolution.JULIE HYMAN: Marco, you sound like a tech guy, not a finance guy because you are a tech guy. You came from Amazon Web Services before. And making that transition from native tech to finance, talk to me about the difference between them. And how good does big finance need to be at tech? And how does the firm think about it versus an actual tech firm?MARCO ARGENTI: Well, see, when I was at Amazon, I was working on digital transformation on some of the larger industrial companies in the world. And especially, I worked a lot with automotive manufacturers. And that made me realize that software is actually becoming the key component of every industry. Think about the evolution of a car that goes from being a mechanical thing to almost being like right now, a data center on wheels. And that is really happening in every segment.And so I think the big difference today is the fact that technology is no longer the back office IT organization. Technology is actually the driver of a lot of competitive advantage and actually is the driver of the strategic agenda of the firm in many cases. And so I think the evolution here is being technologists have a seat at the table when it comes to strategic directions.And one of the cultural changes that we've been trying to apply at Goldman is the idea for developers, which is theoretically a little bit unnatural to go from focusing on the how to actually focusing on the why. We call it working backwards from the customer, really understanding the-- really understanding what problems you're trying to solve, really understanding who is your customer. And then from that, being able to articulate it together with the business owners and then turn it into a solution.And that reversal of priority from how first to why first, I think, is something that really characterizes the new role of the engineer. Engineers roles have changed. And today, it's a mix between data science, traditional development, and business that come together in this powerful combination that, I think, really drives the strategic agenda of any firm.]"

But it’s not too late to find high-quality S&amp;P 500 stocks selling at compelling prices in August 2023.How should an investor choose among various undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks? All seven of these picks have a strong upside today.Adding to that, they are all 5-star stocks, according to Morningstar’s analysts as well. That makes these seven undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks great selections going forward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVerizon Communications (VZ)Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is one of three primary mobile phone carriers in the United States.Investors have long gravitated to this industry for its defensive nature and high dividend yields. That paradigm has come under fire lately, however. After a debt-fueled spending spree, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) was forced to slash its dividend and divest assets recently.Traders have assumed that a similar fate will befall Verizon. Even though Verizon’s profits have been stable and it has maintained its dividend, shares have fallen by about 40% from their prior highs. That’s a massive move for a generally low-volatility blue chip stock such as this one.It’s true that higher interest rates hurt heavily indebted companies such like telecoms. And Verizon is spending heavily on 5G rollouts and other network improvements. But there’s light at the end of the tunnel as spending will finally decline in 2024.All told, VZ stock seems way too beaten up at current depressed levels. Shares go for just 7x forward earnings and offer a 7.8% dividend yield.PayPal Holdings (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comPayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) is an online payment platform. Known for its namesake payment processing service, it has also expanded into ancillary and related services like money transfers.PYPL stock soared to unprecedented heights early on in the pandemic. With global e-commerce booming and brick-and-mortar retailers rushing to install contactless payments solutions, PayPal seemed to be winning on all sides. But as the economy reopened, those tailwinds disappeared and growth rates plunged. And with it, so went PYPL stock.Story continuesWhat a fall it’s been. The stock is down from a peak of more than $300/share to just $63 today. With that sort of decline, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the business had entirely collapsed. And yet, the truth isn’t nearly so dour.Analysts see PayPal growing revenues by 8% this year and earnings per share rising fully by 19% for 2023. Further, double-digit gains are anticipated for 2024. PayPal stock didn’t make much sense at $300 — that was an inexplicable valuation. But, a few years from now, the current depressed valuation may seem equally misguided. At just 12 times forward earnings, and with those earnings continuing to grow rapidly, PYPL stock is a bargain here.Global Payments (GPN)Global Payments office building in Brantford, Ontario, Canada. GPN stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockPaypal isn’t the only payment company unfairly blasted over the past 18 months. Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) shares fell as much as 43% from their 2021 peak to the recent lows.That comes even as Global Payments has continued to grow revenues at 7% annually and earnings at a low double-digit annualized rate. With the share price decline, Global Payments is now going for 12 times forward earnings.This is a huge opportunity. Global Payments is a broadly diversified business offering merchant solutions, issuer services and consumer solutions. That is to say, Global Payments can handle card acceptance, security, accounting and reporting functions, chargeback resolution and a variety of other functions.The company is deeply integrated into merchants’ information technology systems with heavy investments in omnichannel support, making it a leader as retailers pursue sales across various brick-and-mortar and online platforms. GPN stock rallied recently after a far better-than-expected Q2 earnings report. Even so, shares still go for less than $130, whereas Morningstar’s Brett Horn sees fair value at $179 per share.Estee Lauder (EL)An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comEstee Lauder (NYSE:EL) is one of the world’s leading cosmetics companies. Over the years, it has grown tremendously, positioning itself as an accessible luxury.Estee Lauder fared unexpectedly well over the past few years. Despite the pandemic and the temporary closure of shopping centers, Estee Lauder sales held up. The firm’s strong investments in direct-to-consumer and alternative sales channels made it well-positioned to withstand the shake-up. And, as the economy reopened, demand surged as folks wanted to look good coming out of lockdown.That momentum has abruptly reversed in 2023. Weakness with the Chinese consumer market, in particular, has caused Estee Lauder to repeatedly miss estimates. However, with EL stock down 40% over the past 12 months, economic concerns are more than baked into the cake at this point.Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) is a leading triple-net REIT. Triple nets are a type of real estate trust where the tenant — rather than the landlord — pays key expenses such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance. These fare well in inflationary environments as the landlord isn’t on the hook for sharp increases in those costs.Regardless of this advantage, O stock has sold off along with the rest of the REIT industry. Higher interest rates hurt real estate owners since they have to pay out more interest on the debts used to fund property purchases. In addition, investors tend to demand higher dividend yields off their REITs to compensate for elevated interest rates. In a world where a bank Certificate of Deposit pays 5%, investors can be more choosy about their dividend stocks.That said, with O stock down 22% over the past year, the selling has gone too far. Shares now yield 5.2%. And Morningstar’s Kevin Brown sees fair value up at $76, a considerable increase from today’s $58 price.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is a leading specialty chemical company.

Indeed, it is a Dividend Aristocrat, having raised its dividend for more than 25 consecutive years.Shares have sold off sharply in 2023 amid a downturn in demand from China. However, in the bigger picture, electric vehicles continue to take market share, and the batteries needed to power them will consume tons of lithium. In other words, Albemarle is a long-term growth stock currently on sale at a sharp discount.China just surprised the market with an unexpected rate cut. That could be the catalyst to get the Chinese industrial sector going again and lift shares of beaten-down commodity producers such as Albemarle.Tyson Foods (TSN)The corporate headquarters of Tyson Foods (TSN) in Chicago, Illinois. undervalued stocksSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.comTyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) is a packaged foods company focused on meat and meat products.The company’s fortunes have taken a downturn recently due to soaring inflation. As the price of agricultural goods rose with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, livestock costs also jumped, lowering profit margins. As Tyson is largely a commodity producer selling meat at market prices, it doesn’t have much operational flexibility.Thankfully for Tyson, things are now turning in its favor. Grain prices have plummeted as world agricultural conditions have started to normalize. Corn, for example, has fallen more than 40% since its 2022 peak. That should lead to better livestock availability and better results for Tyson.TSN stock, for its own part, is off by a third over the past year. Earnings will be depressed in 2023, and it’s understandable why short-term traders are selling. Longer-term investors, however, are getting a good deal, and there’s a 3.5% dividend yield for shareholders while they wait.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in VZ, EL, GPN, and ALB stock.

82,c41e0299-1282-3868-a786-0cbab5ff3623,MAT,2023-08-22,'Barbie' overtaken by DC's 'Blue Beetle' for no. 1 box office spot,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/barbie-overtaken-dcs-blue-beetle-201142923.html,1692648702.0,VIDEO,"['MAT', 'WBD']","[DC Studios' Blue Beetle assumes the top office spot in its weekend debut, dethroning Greta Gerwig's Barbie movie in weekly gross domestic profits. Both films are distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures (WBD). Yahoo Finance Entertainment Reporter Alexandra Canal analyzes the domestic box office outlook for Blue Beetle while also discussing the $4 movie ticket deals this Sunday for National Cinema Day.Video Transcript- ""Barbie"" dethroned. ""Barbie"" had dominated the domestic Box Office since the film came out in late July. But another movie topped the charts this weekend. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has the details. Ali, take it away.ALEXANDRA CANAL: So ""Barbie"" dethroned for now. You never know what's going to happen.- It could make a comeback.ALEXANDRA CANAL: It could make a comeback. But it's an interesting film to do it. We have ""Blue Beetle,"" which is the latest superhero film from the DC Universe. That is a franchise that certainly struggled recently, especially at the Box Office. And despite being number one, there's really no exception here. I mean, ""Blue Beetle"" had pretty soft results. Just 25.4 million domestically. It didn't have an additional 18 million from overseas. But that's one of the softest debuts in the history of the DCU.Now Warner Brothers Discovery, they blamed tropical storm Hilary as part of the reason why the Box Office results lagged a bit here. David Zaslav, he's certainly been trying to turn around the franchise overall. But this film, it costs $100 million to make. Not to mention all of the marketing costs as well. So that's going to take a lot more if you want a chance for this film to be profitable.So all that to say, not a total win for ""Blue Beetle"" here. But let's also have some context too because ""Barbie,"" I mean, that was number 1 for four weeks in a row. It's set to overtake the ""Super Mario Brothers"" movie as the biggest domestic release of the year. So in my view, still ""Barbie"" Box Office domination, I'd say.Story continues- All right. Ali, I have a confession to make. I have not been to the movie theaters since before the pandemic. I hear this Sunday something might be happening that might even entice me to go.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I think you should go, this Sunday, Jared, because we're talking $4 movies or less. And that's any movie, any time, any format, which includes IMAX, as well. I mean, IMAX tickets, they can cost you anywhere from $15 to $20. So for those that haven't seen ""Oppenheimer"" in IMAX, maybe this Sunday is when you should go. But this is all an honor--- Take the family. Except not to ""Oppenheimer"", maybe.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Exactly. Exactly. Right? This is all in honor of National Cinema Day, which is basically just a day to celebrate the movies from the Cinema Foundation. Last year this day resulted in the highest level of attendance in 2022. And if you have a lot of foot traffic, that means more people are spending money at concessions, more drinks, more popcorn. That all helps movie theaters as well. And it's coming at a time where we are above where we were last year, more than 16% at the Box Office. We're still lagging 2019 by about 5%. But considering where we were at, I'd say we've come a long way at theaters this year.- Doing better than New York subway traffic.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Oh, there you go.- What a frame of reference, Jared.ALEXANDRA CANAL: But that's fine. That's fine. We don't need that to come up right now.- --but I do take the subway. [LAUGHS] That's all right. That's good stuff. All right. Alexandra Canal, thanks so much.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Thank you.]"

ATVI, Mattel, Inc. MAT and Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. TTWO.Industry: Toys, Games &amp; HobbiesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2137995/3-stock-to-watch-from-the-promising-toys-games-industryThe Zacks Toys - Games – Hobbies industry benefits from the robust demand for smart toys, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math) toys, sports toys and fashion dolls and accessories. The industry participants have been undertaking efforts on the digital front and focusing on better execution of marketing and promotional initiatives to drive growth. The industry players, including Activision Blizzard, Inc., Mattel, Inc. and Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc., are likely to gain from the trends above. However, high costs remain a concern for the industry.Industry DescriptionThe Zacks Toys - Games – Hobbies industry comprises companies designing, manufacturing and selling various games and toys. While traditional toymakers primarily focus on marketing and selling action figures, accessories, dolls, youth electronics and arts and crafts, other industry players develop and market content and services on video game consoles, personal computers and mobile. Some industry participants offer video game platforms, playing cards, Karuta and other products along with handheld and home console hardware systems and related software. A few companies also develop and operate retail and online military simulation games and provide multiplayer and single-player games.3 Trends Shaping the Future of Zacks Toys - Games - Hobbies IndustrySTEM Toys Gaining Popularity:Amid declining sales of traditional toys, the robust demand for STEM toys has come as a breather. The Asia Pacific region emerged as a significant growth driver for STEM toys. Countries like India, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand are witnessing rising demand for STEM toys. Parents are focusing more on educational toys to teach their children. The industry players have been capitalizing on new distribution methods, developing digital-play components, exploring ventures with other industries and focusing on international expansion to drive growth. The industry has enormous growth potential in China and Brazil as countries have a massive population of kids aged zero to 14 years.Story continuesFocus on Emerging Markets:The industry participants are focusing on expanding their presence in emerging markets in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin and South America.

Supply chain disruption has been denting the industry's performance. Higher employee-related expenses are also hurting the industry.

Revenues of $820.8 million beat the consensus mark by 2.1% and improved 14.9% year over year. Organic revenues of $769.6 million increased 7.7% year over year. Rollins’ performance in the quarter was positively impacted by a healthy demand environment for its services. The company remained focused on improving the efficiency of its business model and adding customers. Its acquisitions pipeline remained strong in the quarter.Factors in FavorThe demand environment for Rollins remains favorable due to solid construction activity. It has experienced positive revenue growth over the last five years. A well-balanced approach, which combines organic and inorganic growth, has been instrumental in achieving this success. The companys organic revenue growth rate is robust, driven by strong technician and customer retention.Rollins, Inc. Revenue (TTM) Rollins, Inc. Revenue (TTM)Rollins, Inc. revenue-ttm | Rollins, Inc. Quote Anticipated enhancements in benefits are expected to contribute to improved employee and customer retention in the coming years. Additionally, acquisitions have played a significant role in Rollins' business strategy, acting as a major catalyst for growth. Through strategic acquisitions, the company continues to expand its global brand recognition, broaden its geographical presence, and bolster its revenues. Notably, in the years 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019, 2018, and 2017, Rollins successfully completed 31, 39, 31, 30, 38, and 23 acquisitions, respectively.Story continuesRollins places importance on returning capital to shareholders through dividends.

Dividends totaling $211.6 million, $208.7 million, and $160.5 million were disbursed in the years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

Additionally, its subsidiaries are facing various legal actions that allege service-related damages, further impacting costs. As a result, the company's profitability is expected to face ongoing challenges.Rollins' extensive acquisition strategy carries potential integration risks. These acquisitions might adversely affect the company's financial position, evident in the substantial goodwill of $846.7 million, constituting 40% of total assets as of 2022.

The GF Value Line provides a representation of the stock's fair trading value. This value is computed based on historical multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. If a stock's price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued, and its future return is likely to be poor.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of current TV viewing data and global content trends then head straight to the 6 Countries That Watch the Most TV.Recent TV Viewing Data and Global Content TrendsThe TV landscape is witnessing a significant shift, driven by fragmented offerings and the surge in non-linear viewing. As stakeholders adapt their strategies, a consistent focus on fiction in program launches persists. Glance's insights underscore two pivotal trends: the growing prominence of series as IPs and the sustained popularity of older entertainment formats.TV broadcasters are strategically expanding to multiple platforms to cater to the rising demand for non-linear viewing, with ITV's ""Unforgotten"" capturing a substantial audience in 2023. Despite this, the challenge lies in devising effective monetization models amidst content and strategy investments. Concurrently, public broadcasters collaborate and invest in top-tier dramas to stay competitive. However, despite the proliferation of FAST Channels, their viewership remains relatively modest compared to live broadcasts, calling for standardized audience measurement, even as SVOD platforms like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Prime Video, Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)’s Disney+ transition to advertising. Amidst these dynamic changes, ""coopetition"" emerges as a novel strategy for successful content launch and development, reinforcing industry resilience with stable market shares. In 2022, global TV viewers averaged 2 hours 25 minutes daily, varying across 88 countries.Interestingly, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Prime Video and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)’s Disney+ are reportedly exploring the transition to an ad-supported model for their streaming platforms. This entails introducing a more budget-friendly subscription tier with advertisements, allowing users to cut down on subscription costs. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)’s Disney+ have already introduced ad-supported plans in the past year, and if Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Prime Video follows suit, all major streaming services would offer ad-supported options. For Netflix, the choice to incorporate advertisements followed a period of subscriber loss in the initial quarter of 2022, although its subscriber numbers recovered later in the year. And Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)’s Disney+ introduced ad-supported plans for affordability and higher user revenue in late 2022.Story continuesNotably, these ad-supported tiers would be supplementary to their existing ad-free subscription choices. The shift towards ad-supported streaming is driven by the aim to generate additional revenue from entertainment and tap into the migration of advertising funds from traditional television to streaming platforms, while also enticing more subscribers to their video services.Furthermore, recent data indicates a decline in TV viewership from traditional broadcasters. Time spent watching TV shows on traditional channels, including live, recorded, and on-demand content, dropped by 9% compared to 2020 and 4% compared to 2019. This decline indicates an ongoing trend of reduced viewership from traditional broadcasters over the past decade. The share of viewership held by broadcasters also decreased to 59% in 2021, down from 61% in 2020 and 67% in 2019.Amid TV viewership changes, the question remains: Do Americans watch more TV than other countries? According to a study conducted in 2021, television consumption in the United States stands out. After accounting for sleeping hours, Americans dedicated a significant portion of their time to watching television, averaging around 3.35 hours per day. Now, if you’re curious to know which countries watch the most TV, continue reading to uncover the answer in our final segment.20 Countries That Watch the Most TVConcept Photo/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor our list of 20 countries that watch the most TV, we gathered data from reputable sources to obtain information on the average daily TV viewing time for each country.

Germany Average daily TV viewing time: 2.43 hoursIn Germany, people still spend a lot of time with old-fashioned media, like TV, making up 52.5% of their media time. This shows that even though digital media is getting more popular, regular TV is still a big part of how Germans enjoy media. Although they might watch TV a bit less than in some other countries, it's still an important way they enjoy media in Germany.19. South Korea Average daily TV viewing time: 2.46 hoursTV watching in South Korea is changing, with less TV and more digital media. People love dramas, reality shows, and comedy on TV there. Korean dramas are a hit not only in South Korea but also in other Asian countries and beyond. They've even become popular worldwide with translated versions on tapes, DVDs, and digital formats.18. Indonesia Average daily TV viewing time: 2.49 hoursIndonesians typically watch TV for about 2 hours and 49 minutes every day. But, they're getting more into digital media these days.

Ireland Average daily TV viewing time: 2.50 hours People in Ireland typically watch TV for around 2 hours and 50 minutes every day. The preferred TV channels in Ireland are RTÉ One, RTÉ Two, Virgin Media One, and Virgin Media Two. These channels offer a variety of shows, including news, entertainment, and sports programs.16.

News channels continue to be popular, with 38% of respondents relying on them for news in 2023. This underscores that TV remains a significant news source in Australia.15.

United Kingdom Average daily TV viewing time: 2.55 hours The emergence of streaming platforms has greatly affected traditional TV channels in the UK, leading to a decrease in live TV watching and ad earnings. WARC's report predicts a 3.1% drop in worldwide TV advertising revenue in 2023, largely due to the impact of streaming services. According to Ofcom's findings, live TV viewing in the UK dropped by 13% in 2021. As traditional TV consumption declines, streaming services are gaining more traction and popularity in the UK.13. Turkey Average daily TV viewing time: 2.58 hoursTurkish television audiences exhibit a pronounced fondness for TV series, leading to substantial economic, industrial, and artistic advancements within Turkey's TV series sector since the early 2000s. These Turkish TV series, referred to as ""diziler,"" have garnered significant attention both domestically and on the global stage. However, there has been a consistent decrease in overall television consumption within Turkey, a trend attributed to the evolving media landscape and the ascent of online media platforms. Despite this decline, television remains the primary source of news for the majority in Turkey, even as traditional print newspapers have waned in popularity. This enduring dominance of television as a news medium is propelled by effective governmental regulation and the convenience of accessibility.12. Italy Average daily TV viewing time: 2.59 hoursMost Italians aged 16 to 75 like watching TV in the evening, from 9 pm to 11 pm, with 46.6% choosing this time.

The TV market in Argentina might shrink, possibly due to the growth of digital streaming platforms.8.

89,16cdc9bf-caeb-391a-9bde-9efa33390822,NFLX,2023-08-22,Hollywood strikes: WGA calls for end of media consolidation,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/hollywood-strikes-wga-calls-end-164901905.html,1692636541,VIDEO,"['AMZN', 'NFLX', 'DIS']","[The Writers Guild of America calls Netflix (NFLX), Disney (DIS), and Amazon (AMZN) the ""new gatekeepers"" of the media business and warns against media consolidation in its new report. Yahoo Finance Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down the WGA's report and what it means for the future of the industry.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: There's a new call for regulation in the streaming space. The Writers Guild of America has issued a new report calling Netflix, Amazon, and Disney the, quote, ""new gatekeepers"" of the media business and warns regulators to put a stop to consolidation in the industry. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has those details. Alexandra, what are you watching?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hi, Rachelle, yes, a very fiery report from the Writers Guild of America late last week calling for the end of media consolidation. According to this report, as you just mentioned, Netflix, Amazon, Disney, some of the biggest behemoths in Hollywood right now-- they have so much market power, the WGA says, that they are dragging down wages. They're limiting viewer choice.But what really stuck out to me here was that warning about media consolidation, the WGA writing, quote, ""Any mergers in media and entertainment involving significant streaming players should be blocked, including acquisitions of smaller or potential competitors."" And this is something that has been potentially on the horizon for quite some time. Consolidation, which many executives have argued, is the name of the game.There are too many streaming services out there. I think you can see that by how we've seen a subscriber slowdown over the past year or so, those numbers slowing significantly. On top of that, companies have been struggling with profitability as streaming losses continue to be a problem. That's why we've seen more ad supported tiers. We've seen a wider crackdown on password sharing.So the expectation over the next five years is that we're going to see a lot less media players than we have today, which means the bigger guys who can afford it, which are your Apples, your Amazons on the world-- of the world, maybe potentially even Netflix-- they could gobble up some of those smaller players. And if that happens, the writers are going to feel the fallout there.Story continuesAnd that's what's really making these negotiations so complicated. The writers are not just negotiating for where the media environment is today. They're also trying to negotiate for where the media industry is heading. And there's a lot of question marks around that, especially surrounding AI, streaming residuals, and those are two issues that remain a critical component of these ongoing talks.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, certainly, when you consider where traditional media was and where it is now with streamers, it makes sense. So then where does the talk stand today? And is there any end in sight?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, the good news is that they're still talking. The progression of those talks is still TBD. There aren't any formal deals being made at this point, but it does seem encouraging that both sides do want to make a deal at this point. Like I said, there's still some sticking points there.The writers-- they've been very adamant in their language. They're certainly going to hold off for a good deal. However, we are well past the 100-day mark. We're already seeing the ripple effect throughout the LA economy. Some of our favorite TV shows, movies-- they're being weighed to be pushed into 2024 or beyond.So we're entering this critical juncture when it comes to these talks. Hopefully, we can strike a deal soon. And I do think if the studios are able to negotiate a deal with the writers, the actors will soon follow. So it all comes down to these negotiations, but we're entering another week of talks, which is a positive.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. As long as the dialogue is still going on, at least that's something. Great stuff there. Our very own Allie Canal, thanks so much.]"

Maxx and Marshalls, all raised their full-year outlooks last week after reporting stronger than expected sales in the second quarter. These retailers, which live in the off-price and discount sector, benefited from a value-focused trend pushing consumers to save where they can during an uncertain economic environment.More from Footwear NewsTarget CEO Addresses Pride Controversy &amp; How the Chain Will Move Forward After Sales HitTJ Maxx Is Winning Bama Rush - and Gen Z“Customers are stretching their dollars further and seeking better value across more categories more often,” said Walmart CFO John Rainey in a call with investors last week. He also noted that sales of grocery staples and in-home meals saw an uptick, in addition to kitchen tools that can assist in at-home meal prep.“They’re also buying more necessities and focusing on lower-priced items and brands,” he said.Ross Stores’ CEO Barbara Rentler noted in a call with investors that consumers responded well to its “improved value offerings” throughout its stores. TJX Companies’ apparel business, including accessories, saw a high single-digit comp increase, despite the discretionary nature of that category.“Across the board in retail, we see a flight to value as shoppers look to make their budgets stretch further,” said managing director of GlobalData Neil Saunders in a statement. “Through its various banners, TJX is on the right side of these trends and is benefitting as a result. That said, we also recognize the skill that goes into creating a compelling assortment which makes consumers want to part with their money.”BTIG analyst Janine Stichter also surmised that the strong results across these three retailers suggest that value is resonating with consumers.“The relative strength in the value segment suggests a trade-down, notably in apparel where off-price is clearly outperforming full-price,” wrote BTIG analyst Janine Stichter in a Sunday note to investors. “The stronger relative performance of consumables and private label suggests consumers remaining judicious.”Story continuesThe outlier case among these companies was Target, which downgraded its full-year outlook after noting softer spending in discretionary categories. At the same time, several footwear brands this quarter experienced significant declines this quarter amid inventory excesses, a conservative wholesale environment and consumers who are spending less on discretionary categories. In the last few weeks, Adidas, Steve Madden, Skechers, Deckers, Puma and Columbia Sportswear have all specifically lamented the challenges in the U.S. market.Jane Hali &amp; Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez noted that recent store checks for TJX, Burlington Coat Factory and Ross all appeared to have strong traffic and that strong back-to-school assortments in each chain will likely continue to be a further tailwind for the channel through the summer“We continue to believe the off-price sector is best positioned during this difficult discretionary market,” Ramirez wrote in a note to clients. “The channel offers great value on branded product.”Best of Footwear NewsA History of Forever 21: From Humble Beginnings to Bankruptcy and the Shaquille O'Neal BouncebackFootwear Company CEOs You Should KnowList of Footwear Company CEOs You Should Know]"

Home Depot reiterated its forward guidance after lowering the outlook last quarter and Target guided lower on both sales and revenue forecasts.Target CEO Brian Cornell noted on the earnings call that ""As we look at the consumer landscape today, we recognize the consumer is still challenged by the levels of inflation that they're seeing in food and beverage and household essentials...So that's absorbing a much bigger portion of their budget.""On the flip side, both Walmart and The TJX Companies raised forward guidance and beat sales and earnings estimates.Not too surprisingly, Walmart and The TJX Companies enjoy Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) ratings, while Target and Home Depot have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesThe TJX CompaniesThe TJX Companies is a leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide with 4,865 stores. The company's broad range of assortments at varying prices helps it to reach out to a broad range of consumers. Additionally, TJX attracts consumers through rapid turn of inventories, which makes for an always fresh range of discounted products.On Wednesday, TJX reported Q2 earnings. EPS came in at $0.85, a 23% YoY increase and well above estimates of $0.77. Sales $12.76 billion also beat estimates of $12.45 billion and showed a 7.7% YoY gain.TJX has begun to see analysts revise earnings estimates higher, with both FY23 and FY24 earnings being upgraded by 1% over the last month. Both sales and earnings are projected to grow at a very nice pace over the next two years.Shares of TJX blasted to all-time highs following the stellar earnings report and are now up 13.2% YTD. The TJX Companies stock has compounded at an annual rate of 14% over the last ten years, outperforming the broad market.TJX is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 25x, which is below the industry average of 27x, and above its 10-year median of 21.2x. Additionally, the company offers a dividend yield of 1.5% and has raised the payment by an average of 9.7% annually over the last five years.WalmartSurprisingly, Walmart shares are selling off following its exceptional earnings report. Nonetheless, the stock looks very appealing at the current levels, and new business verticals at the retail giant look to be paying off.WMT has been gaining momentum in two of its high margin revenue streams; advertisements and its membership program Walmart+. Walmart has added in-store ads in the aisles, on the checkout screens, and played over the stores radio, and has recruited its most engaged customers to its membership program. These developments have been critical in raising earnings expectations. The advertisement business grew a reported 36% YoY.Walmart also saw momentum in its e-commerce business. Online sales jumped 24% YoY.Analysts have taken notice and began raising earnings estimates over the last two months. Current quarter earnings estimates have been raised by 1.2%, and FY23 estimates by 0.6%.WMT is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 25.5x, which is above the industry average of 23.2x, and above its five-year median of 23.4x. The company also pays a dividend yield of 1.4% and has raised it by an average of 1.9% annually over the last five years.Target After trading immediately lower following the earnings report, Target stock has recovered and rallied ~5% off its 2023 lows. And while investors may want to wait for analysts to begin revising their earnings estimates higher, raising its Zacks Rank, TGT is now trading at a fairly compelling valuation.Target is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 16.2x, which is well below the industry average of 27x, and below its five-year median of 18.3x. The company also pays a dividend yield of 3.4% and has raised the payment by an average of 13% annually over the last five years.Admittedly, earnings estimates have been revised lower almost unanimously by analysts. Current quarter earnings estimates have been downgraded by -7.4% and FY23 earnings estimates by -4.5%.However, another point on the bullish side is that EPS are projected to grow nicely in the coming quarters. Current quarter earnings are expected to climb 23% YoY to $1.89 and FY23 EPS are forecast to grow 31% YoY to $7.88. This follows management's effort to build back profitability at the retailer.Target shares are now -50% off their all-time high. The stock has compounded at an annual rate of 8.1% over the last 20 years, underperforming the broad market.Home DepotHome Depot has compounded at an incredible 15% annually over the last 20 years, far outperforming the broad market. HD also offers a dividend yield of 2.5% and has raised it by an average of 14.5% annually over the last five years.However, as fantastic as the stock has been over the years, the near future may be a bit rocky. While HD reported EPS of $4.65 beating estimates of $4.45 it showed a YoY decline from $5.05. Sales also beat estimates and showed a slight decline YoY.The earnings revision trend has been mixed, giving HD a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but forecasts are weak over the next year. Sales and earnings are expected to fall through the year end. Although there is a light at the end of the tunnel, sales and earnings growth are expected to resume in FY24.While HD management still believes their core customers are in a healthy place economically, the reality is that Covid pulled forward a lot of DIY home improvement sales. With people stuck at home during the pandemic, many homeowners opted to do work on their homes, and are not yet at the point where they need to do more.Home Depot is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.3x, which is above the market average of 20.6x, and just above its 10-year median of 21.2x.Bottom LineThe US economy is in an interesting position, and this week's retail earnings provided some useful information. Obviously, the economy is growing at a nice pace, however the average American is still dealing with a tight budget, forced to cut certain expenses to cover the necessities.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

99,82b1a397-b942-3311-b60f-a28e8a815458,AMGN,2023-08-22,AMGEN TO DISCUSS APPLICATION FOR LUMAKRAS® (SOTORASIB) FOR THE TREATMENT OF KRAS G12C-POSITIVE NSCLC AT FDA ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEETING,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/amgen-discuss-application-lumakras-sotorasib-200000891.html,1692648000,STORY,['AMGN'],"[THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Aug. 21, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) will review data supporting the supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the full approval of LUMAKRAS® (sotorasib) for adults with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at a meeting on Oct. 5, 2023.LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS is approved in several markets outside the United States including Europe, South America, Asia and the European Union. To date, over 6,500 patients around the world have received LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS through the clinical development program and commercial use.Lumakras has demonstrated a favorable benefit/risk profile in multiple studies in non-small lung cancer and other tumor types such as colo-rectal cancer. Amgen is progressing the largest and broadest global KRASG12C inhibitor development program exploring multiple combination regimens, with clinical trial sites spanning five continents.""We believe in the clinical value of LUMAKRAS for prescribers and patients navigating KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC and we look forward to discussing the comprehensive data package for LUMAKRAS with members of the Committee,"" said David M. Reese, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen.LUMAKRAS received accelerated approval from the FDA on May 28, 2021. The sNDA for full approval of LUMAKRAS was accepted by the FDA for standard review and a Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) target action date of Dec. 24, 2023, has been set.About LUMAKRAS®/LUMYKRAS® (sotorasib)Amgen took on one of the toughest challenges of the last 40 years in cancer research by developing LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS, a KRASG12C inhibitor.1 LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS has demonstrated a positive benefit-risk profile with rapid, deep, and durable anticancer activity in patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring the KRAS G12C mutation with a once daily oral formulation.2Story continuesIn May 2021, LUMAKRAS was the first KRASG12C inhibitor to receive regulatory approval with its approval in the U.S., under accelerated approval. LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS is also approved in the European Union, Japan, United Arab Emirates, South Korea, Hong Kong, Switzerland, Taiwan, Turkey, Thailand, Qatar, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, Canada, Great Britain, Kuwait, Macao, Singapore, Mexico, Israel, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, and Russia. Additionally, Amgen has submitted MAAs in Colombia, Malaysia and Saudi Arabia.LUMAKRAS/LUMYKRAS is also being studied in multiple other solid tumors.About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer and the KRAS G12C MutationLung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and it accounts for more deaths worldwide than colon cancer, breast cancer and prostate cancer combined.3 Overall survival rates for NSCLC are improving but remain poor for patients with advanced disease, and 5-year survival is only 9% for those with metastatic disease.4KRAS G12C is the most common KRAS mutation in NSCLC.5 About 13% of patients with NSCLC harbor the KRAS G12C mutation.6 The unmet medical need remains high and treatment options are limited for NSCLC patients with the KRAS G12C mutation whose first-line treatment has failed to work or has stopped working. The outcomes with other approved therapies are suboptimal, with a median progression-free survival of approximately four months following second-line treatment of KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC.7About CodeBreaKThe CodeBreaK clinical development program for Amgen's drug sotorasib is designed to study patients with an advanced solid tumor with the KRAS G12C mutation and address the longstanding unmet medical need for these cancers. CodeBreaK 100, the Phase 1 and 2, first-in-human, open-label multicenter study, enrolled patients with KRAS G12C-mutant solid tumors.8 Eligible patients must have received a prior line of systemic anticancer therapy, consistent with their tumor type and stage of disease. The primary endpoint for the Phase 2 study was centrally assessed objective response rate. The Phase 2 trial in NSCLC enrolled 126 patients, 124 of whom had centrally evaluable lesions by RECIST at baseline.2 The Phase 2 trial in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) enrolled 62 patients and results have been published.9CodeBreaK 200, the global Phase 3 multicenter, randomized, open-label, active-controlled study compared the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sotorasib to docetaxel in KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC completed enrollment of 345 patients. Eligible patients had previously treated, locally advanced and unresectable or metastatic KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival and key secondary endpoints included overall survival, objective response rate, and patient-reported outcomes.10CodeBreaK 300, the global Phase 3 randomized active-controlled study comparing sotorasib in combination with panitumumab to investigator's choice (trifluridine and tipiracil, or regorafenib) in chemorefractory KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC, has completed enrollment of 160 patients. Eligible patients had KRAS G12C-mutated mCRC, received at least one prior line of therapy, and have received and progressed on or after fluoropyrimidine, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival and key secondary endpoints include overall survival (OS) and objective response rate (ORR).11Amgen also has several Phase 1b studies investigating sotorasib in combination with several other treatments across various advanced solid tumors (CodeBreaK 101) open for enrollment.12  A Phase 3 randomized controlled study will evaluate frontline sotorasib in combination with platinum doublet chemotherapy versus pembrolizumab platinum doublet combination in patients with PD-L1-negative, advanced KRAS G12C-mutated NSCLC (CodeBreaK 202).13LUMAKRAS® (sotorasib) U.S. IndicationLUMAKRAS is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with KRAS G12C-mutated locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as determined by an FDA-approved test, who have received at least one prior systemic therapy.This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR). Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s).LUMAKRAS® (sotorasib) Important U.S. Safety Information Hepatotoxicity LUMAKRAS can cause hepatotoxicity, which may lead to drug-induced liver injury and hepatitis.Among 357 patients who received LUMAKRAS in CodeBreaK 100, hepatotoxicity occurred in 1.7% (all grades) and 1.4% (Grade 3). A total of 18% of patients who received LUMAKRAS had increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/increased aspartate aminotransferase (AST); 6% were Grade 3 and 0.6% were Grade 4. In addition to dose interruption or reduction, 5% of patients received corticosteroids for the treatment of hepatotoxicity.Monitor liver function tests (ALT, AST and total bilirubin) prior to the start of LUMAKRAS every 3 weeks for the first 3 months of treatment, then once a month or as clinically indicated, with more frequent testing in patients who develop transaminase and/or bilirubin elevations.Withhold, dose reduce or permanently discontinue LUMAKRAS based on severity of adverse reaction.Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)/Pneumonitis LUMAKRAS can cause ILD/pneumonitis that can be fatal. Among 357 patients who received LUMAKRAS in CodeBreaK 100, ILD/pneumonitis occurred in 0.8% of patients, all cases were Grade 3 or 4 at onset, and 1 case was fatal. LUMAKRAS was discontinued due to ILD/pneumonitis in 0.6% of patients.Monitor patients for new or worsening pulmonary symptoms indicative of ILD/pneumonitis (e.g., dyspnea, cough, fever). Immediately withhold LUMAKRAS in patients with suspected ILD/pneumonitis and permanently discontinue LUMAKRAS if no other potential causes of ILD/pneumonitis are identified.Most Common Adverse Reactions The most common adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 20% were diarrhea, musculoskeletal pain, nausea, fatigue, hepatotoxicity and cough.Drug Interactions Advise patients to inform their healthcare provider of all concomitant medications, including prescription medicines, over-the-counter drugs, vitamins, dietary and herbal products.Inform patients to avoid proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor antagonists while taking LUMAKRAS.If coadministration with an acid-reducing agent cannot be avoided, inform patients to take LUMAKRAS 4 hours before or 10 hours after a locally acting antacid.Please see LUMAKRAS full Prescribing Information.

All statements, other than statements of historical fact, are statements that could be deemed forward-looking statements, including any statements on the outcome, benefits and synergies of collaborations, or potential collaborations, with any other company (including BeiGene, Ltd., Kyowa-Kirin Co., Ltd., or any collaboration to manufacture therapeutic antibodies against COVID-19), the performance of Otezla® (apremilast) (including anticipated Otezla sales growth and the timing of non-GAAP EPS accretion), the Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. acquisition, the Teneobio, Inc. acquisition, the ChemoCentryx, Inc. acquisition, or the proposed acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics plc (including the potential outcome of any litigation with the Federal Trade Commission, prospective performance and outlook of Horizon's business, performance and opportunities and any potential strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities expected as a result of such acquisition), as well as estimates of revenues, operating margins, capital expenditures, cash, other financial metrics, expected legal, arbitration, political, regulatory or clinical results or practices, customer and prescriber patterns or practices, reimbursement activities and outcomes, effects of pandemics or other widespread health problems such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, outcomes, progress, and other such estimates and results. Forward-looking statements involve significant risks and uncertainties, including those discussed below and more fully described in the Securities and Exchange Commission reports filed by Amgen, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequent periodic reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this news release and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Discovery or identification of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, preclinical results do not guarantee safe and effective performance of product candidates in humans. The complexity of the human body cannot be perfectly, or sometimes, even adequately modeled by computer or cell culture systems or animal models. The length of time that it takes for us to complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for product marketing has in the past varied and we expect similar variability in the future. Even when clinical trials are successful, regulatory authorities may question the sufficiency for approval of the trial endpoints we have selected. We develop product candidates internally and through licensing collaborations, partnerships and joint ventures. Product candidates that are derived from relationships may be subject to disputes between the parties or may prove to be not as effective or as safe as we may have believed at the time of entering into such relationship. Also, we or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market.Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, difficulties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to significant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a significant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of significant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. There can be no guarantee that we will be able to realize any of the strategic benefits, synergies or opportunities arising from the Horizon acquisition, and such benefits, synergies or opportunities may take longer to realize than expected.  We may not obtain regulatory clearance to acquire Horizon or be able to successfully integrate Horizon, and such acquisition or integration may take longer, be more difficult or cost more than expected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach of our information technology systems could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Our business and operations may be negatively affected by the failure, or perceived failure, of achieving our environmental, social and governance objectives. The effects of global climate change and related natural disasters could negatively affect our business and operations. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.The scientific information discussed in this news release related to our product candidates is preliminary and investigative. Such product candidates are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the product candidates. Further, any scientific information discussed in this news release relating to new indications for our products is preliminary and investigative and is not part of the labeling approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the products. The products are not approved for the investigational use(s) discussed in this news release, and no conclusions can or should be drawn regarding the safety or effectiveness of the products for these uses.CONTACT: Amgen, Thousand OaksElissa Snook, 609-251-1407 (media)Jessica Akopyan, 805-440-5721 (media)Justin Claeys, 805-313-9775 (investors)1 Canon J, et al. Nature. 2019;575:217–223.2 Skoulidis F, et al. N Engl J Med. 2021;384:2371-2381.3 Sung H, et al.

100,6e2abbdb-f3bc-4e04-af22-ccddd2fc5d7a,AMGN,2023-08-22,Medicare drug price negotiations unlikely to be derailed by lawsuits: UBS,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medicare-drug-price-negotiations-unlikely-to-be-derailed-by-lawsuits-ubs-165832314.html,1692637112,STORY,"['LLY', 'JNJ', 'BAYRY', 'BAYZF', 'BMY', 'PFE', 'ALPMF', 'ALPMY', 'AZN', 'AZNCF', 'AMGN', 'ABBV', 'MRK']","[Lawsuits brought by big pharmaceutical companies and industry lobbying groups are unlikely to delay Medicare's drug pricing negotiations, Wall Street analysts say.The industry is anxiously awaiting the Sept. 1 release of the first 10 drugs the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will target for new negotiated prices.The negotiated prices are slated to go into effect in 2026, but many of the companies whose products are suspected to be on the inaugural list have already filed suit against the US Health Department, which oversees CMS, and US Health Secretary Xavier Becerra.""We believe these strategies are unlikely to result in an intended pause/delay of IRA implementation; conversely, the Department of Justice has criticized the Chamber's request to delay the drug price negotiation process,"" analysts at UBS wrote in a note to clients on Monday.Merck (MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), and Astellas Pharma (ALPMY) are among the companies suing, along with trade groups PhRMA and the US Chamber of Commerce. AARP joined in the battle, filing an amicus brief on behalf of HHS on Friday. J&amp;J and Bristol have asked for their lawsuits to be merged, and several have asked for summary judgement, which would avoid a drawn-out trial process.Various lists have been published in an attempt to guess which products CMS will target.UBS includes some common assumptions like Merck's diabetes drug Januvia, J&amp;J and Bayer's blood thinner Xarelto, Pfizer (PFE) and Bristol's blood thinner Eliquis, J&amp;J and AbbVie's (ABBV) cancer drug Imbruvica, and Pfizer and Astellas's Xtandi.Bottles and pills of Xarelto, marketed by Janssen Pharmaceutical, sit on a counter at a pharmacy in Provo, Utah, Jan. 9, 2020. (George Frey/REUTERS) (George Frey / reuters)Some of these are listed in the lawsuits brought on by the companies who anticipate being targeted.UBS has also included AstraZeneca's (AZN) Farxiga, Amgen's (AMGN) Enbrel, Astellas's Myrbetriq, and Boehringer Ingelheim's Spiriva, and its Jardiance with Eli Lilly (LLY).Story continuesThe companies will have until Oct. 1 to sign an agreement to begin negotiations with CMS. And in UBS's view, this process actually getting underway could take some pressure off the sector.""Although the beginning of IRA implementation is a watershed moment for the industry, we argue that the next 1-2 steps could see overhang removal for the Pharma sector in the near term,"" UBS said.The lawsuits cite either the First, Fifth, or Eighth Amendments, alleging the powers granted to Medicare by Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act are unconstitutional.""Given that IRA disallows 'administrative and judicial review' of how CMS determines negotiation-eligible drugs and maximum fair prices, lawsuits are challenging the implementation on constitutional grounds,"" UBS wrote.Some legal experts see this strategy as a likely path to the Supreme Court.UBS analysts echoed a similar sentiment, saying the lawsuits, filed in various district courts around the country, could help fast-track the suits to what they called a ""business-friendly"" Supreme Court.The lawsuits citing the First Amendment claim the companies believe their freedom of speech is being taken away as they are only given a negotiation window, but not a chance to opt out of the negotiations.The lawsuits citing the Fifth Amendment claim the lack of option qualifies as government seizure of their property, and the Eighth Amendment was cited for excessive fines — or the penalty that Medicare can levy for noncompliance.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

If you want to skip our introduction to the biotechnology industry and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then head on over to 5 Most Profitable Biotech Stocks Today. Biotechnology is one of the fastest growing industries these days. Its successes have been influenced in a large amount by the advances in technology which have enabled biotechnology companies to develop new treatments, medicines, and products with the computing power that was unavailable just a decade ago. One technology that has been at the center of the attention of both the stock market and the media is artificial intelligence. In the biotech industry there are many companies using AI to make innovative treatments. One firm that has been using AI and machine learning in biotechnology for years now is Atomwise. The company uses a computational neural network (CNN) to discover billions of small molecules for drug development. As of 2023, Atomwise has generated more than $174 million in funding from venture capital financing, and the company also has a partnership with the pharmaceutical giant Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) for a deal that can potentially be worth $1 billion to discover medical compounds that will exclusively be used by Sanofi.Another firm that integrated AI into its operations before the recent hype is Eyenuk, Inc. It uses its AI platform called EyeArt to not only screen for eye diseases based on images but also predict whether such diseases can occur in the future. The firm scored a big win in June 2023 when the FDA approved a camera to be used with its EyeArt system to detect diabetic retinopathy.These developments make it clear that the biotechnology sector is perhaps one of the most revolutionary industries these days. They also show that the industry has a lot of potential apart from developing vaccines for the coronavirus pandemic - which itself has proved to be a major catalyst for the sector. Another big catalyst that might make biotechnology one of the most lucrative industries in the world is its ability to develop treatments for some of the most deadly and painful diseases known to humans. These diseases are collectively referred to as cancer, and cancer can affect a lot of body organs which makes it difficult to develop treatments since each different kind of cancer has its own mutations. Cancer treatments are further complicated by the fact that while some options do exist, cancer cells often evolve to defeat them.Story continuesOn this front, researchers from New York University's Langone Health Center have researched new antibodies to biologically 'mark' the cancer cells so that the body's immune system can target them and fight the disease. The treatment shows potential as a lab study with dish grown cancer cells saw immune system antibodies successfully recognize the cancer cell 'flags' and attack them as a result. Another firm that is leveraging biotechnology and artificial intelligence to fight cancer is Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A). Agilent has partnered up with another company, Visiopharm, to use AI for sifting through datasets for recognizing biological patterns in images to diagnose the correct diseases for an effective treatment plan.However, not all is rosy in the biotechnology industry. While the technologies, developments, and treatments that we've shared above have immense potential, the simple fact is that these technologies cost vast sums of money simply for research and development. At the same time, the fruits of this spending might take years to appear, which often ends up making several biotechnology firms unprofitable. To gauge a sense of just how capitally intensive spending in the biotechnology industry is, consider the fact that according to Deloitte, the average cost of developing a drug sits at a whopping $2.3 billion at the biggest biopharmaceutical companies in the world. At the same time, the return on investment on these drugs sits at just 1.2% - so the biotechnology companies have to be absolutely certain of future market potential and profitability when investing in drugs.As to the biotechnology companies themselves, we made a list of the 10 Most Promising Biotech Stocks According to Analysts to find out that the top firms were Zai Lab Limited (NASDAQ:ZLAB), Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIR), and Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA). Here is what the management of Vir Biotechnology had to say during its latest earnings call:Now, let’s turn to chronic hepatitis B. Unlike the current standard-of-care, which requires taking antiviral medicines for the rest of one’s life and does not eliminate the risk of cirrhosis or liver cancer, our goal is a functional cure. After completing a functional cure therapy, there should be no need for further treatment and there should also be a further reduction in the risk of liver complications. Our functional cure hypothesis is based on a novel widely accepted belief that chronic hepatitis B is an immunologic disease caused by a virus. As such, we believe that combinations of anti-virus alone are not enough. Instead, we believe functional cure requires a combination of antivirus with immunologic agents.We call our approach stop and clear. We stop the virus from replicating and clear already infected cells by immune-stimulation. This is the fundamentally different hypothesis we seek to prove in our clinical trials. Our clinical development pathway has been as follows. We began with Phase 1 and Phase 2a studies that are exploring different combinations of anti-virals and immunomodulators. By specifically using small courts in these studies, we are able to explore a broad space of possibilities to help identify the right combination, dose, duration, frequency, and population. In the studies, we have made two major advances towards a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B that highlight why we believe we can succeed. One, At 11 June, we showed that we could achieve a durable off treatment response in 16% of participants who received VIR-2218, and pegylated interferon alpha for 48 weeks.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most profitable biotechnology companies in the world out of which the top picks are Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc.

102,884c7b50-bb9f-3bd8-b627-7043e47c3b5a,AMGN,2023-08-22,Is Trending Stock Amgen Inc. (AMGN) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-amgen-inc-amgn-130005878.html,1692622805,STORY,['AMGN'],"[Amgen (AMGN) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this world's largest biotech drugmaker have returned +11.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, which Amgen falls in, has lost 2.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Amgen is expected to post earnings of $4.68 per share, indicating a change of -0.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.8% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $18.35 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.7%. This estimate has changed +3.7% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.82 indicates a change of +8% from what Amgen is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +7.1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amgen.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Amgen, the consensus sales estimate of $6.94 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +4.3%. The $27.11 billion and $30.97 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +3% and +14.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryAmgen reported revenues of $6.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +5.9%. EPS of $5 for the same period compares with $4.65 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.63 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.41%. The EPS surprise was +12.61%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Amgen is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amgen. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The ACCC is expected to convey its clearance of the transaction to Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board for consideration.Newmont continues advancing other regulatory approvals and expects to close the transaction in the fourth quarter of this year. Earlier this month, Korea’s Fair Trade Commission and Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) Independent Consumer &amp; Competition Commission cleared the proposed acquisition. In July, the Canadian Competition Bureau issued a ""no action"" letter also clearing the transaction.Other regulatory approvals to be secured for Newmont’s proposed acquisition of Newcrest include the Australia Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC), and the Philippine Competition Commission (PCC). Newmont and Newcrest also continue engaging with the PNG Government and regulators about other approvals and clearances for the transaction.On May 14, Newmont announced its definitive agreement to acquire Newcrest. The combination would create a world-class portfolio of assets with the highest concentration of Tier 1 operations, primarily in favorable, low-risk mining jurisdictions. Upon closing of the transaction, the combined company would deliver a multi-decade production profile from 10 large, long-life, low cost, Tier 1 operations, and increased annual copper production primarily from Australia and Canada. The combined business is anticipated to generate annual pre-tax synergies of $500 million, expected to be achieved within the first 24 months, while also targeting at least $2 billion in the first two years after closing through portfolio optimization.1Story continues_________________________1See cautionary statement for additional information.About NewmontNewmont is the world’s leading gold company and a producer of copper, silver, zinc and lead.

Synergies represent management’s combined estimate of pre-tax synergies, supply chain efficiencies and Full Potential improvements, as a result of the integration of Newmont’s and Newcrest’s businesses that have been monetized for the purposes of the estimation. Because synergies estimates reflect differences between certain actual costs incurred and management estimates of costs that would have been incurred in the absence of the integration of Newmont’s and Newcrest’s businesses, such estimates are necessarily imprecise and are based on numerous judgments and assumptions.

The company cited a faster-than-anticipated rise in credit card delinquencies, signaling more financial pressure for shoppers in the back half of the year.Macy's also joined many other retailers in flagging uncertainty over the end of the student loan moratorium, which had provided one-time college students a little more financial breathing room.Shares in Macy's Inc. were down more than 14% in afternoon trading on Tuesday.“As we plan the remainder of the year and we think about 2024, we remain cautious on the pressures impacting our customer, especially at Macy’s, where roughly 50% of the identified customers have an average household income of $75,000 or under,” CEO Jeff Gennette told analysts during the company's earnings call Tuesday.Gennette noted that over the past several quarters, he has seen Macy's customers more aggressively pull back on discretionary items and become more intentional in their purchases.Macy’s is one of the last remaining retailers to report second-quarter results in an earnings season that has shown how still-high inflation, despite some easing, and higher interest rates are forcing shoppers to to cut back on discretionary items like clothing in order to afford their larger grocery bills.Target reported its first quarterly sales decline in six years last week, dragged down by cautious spending in addition to backlash by some customers to its Pride merchandise.Home Depot, the nation’s largest home improvement retailer, said last week that sales continue to decline, with a fall-off in big-ticket items like appliances and other things that often require financing. That’s become a problem with interest rates rising rapidly over the past year, making credit cards a much bigger burden for consumers.Story continuesBut Walmart racked up another strong quarterly sales gain as its low prices continue to attract budget-conscious consumers looking for deals in a tough economic environment. The nation’s largest retailer boosted its annual outlook last week after reporting better-than-expected second-quarter results.Macy's reported a loss of $22 million, or 8 cents per share, in the quarter ended July 29. That compares with a profit of $275 million, or 99 cents per share, in the year-ago period.The loss includes a non-cash settlement charge related to the transfer of pension obligations for certain retirees and beneficiaries under the company’s pension plan. Adjusted earnings for the latest quarter were 26 cents per share.Revenue fell to $5.28 billion from $5.83 billion from a year ago. Analysts had expected a profit of 14 cents on sales of $5.06 billion.Online sales were down 10% for the quarter, compared with the year-ago period.Overall, comparable sales — those from stores and digital channels opened at least a year — were down 7.3% in the quarter. The figure includes licensed owned businesses like cosmetics.Top-performing categories at Macy's included beauty, women’s career clothing and men's tailored clothing. Casual clothing and sleepwear sales remain weak, the company said.Merchandise inventories were down 10% from a year ago and down 18% compared with 2019, the company said.Gennette told The Associated Press in an interview Tuesday that despite inflation easing in some areas, shoppers are not yet seeing a benefit. And he noted that while they still have savings, he's seeing that more of their pocketbook is going toward services and experiences.In a separate announcement, Macy's said it would open new small format stores in the West and Northeast in a bid to increase customer visits and attract new shoppers. Macy's noted that the small stores opened more than a year posted positive comparable sales, including licensed businesses._____Follow Anne D’Innocenzio: http://twitter.com/ADInnocenzio]"

While the company had expected delinquencies to rise as part of the normalizing credit environment, the speed at which the increase occurred for the company and the broader credit card industry since the company’s first quarter earnings call was faster than expected. This negatively impacted second quarter results and led to an increase in the portfolio’s bad debt outlook. Second quarter 2023 credit card revenues include the pro-rata recognition of the updated annual bad debt outlook.Inventory turnover, on a trailing twelve-month basis, was roughly flat to 2022 and up 15% to 2019.Merchandise inventories were down 10% year-over-year and down 18% to 2019, reflecting ongoing disciplined inventory management and the clearance of excess spring seasonal product. The company continues to focus on ensuring that merchandise inventories are current, contain compelling product, and are at the appropriate receipt levels based on expected sales demand.Gross margin rate for the quarter was 38.1%, down from 38.9% in the second quarter of 2022.Merchandise margin declined 130 basis points, due to heightened levels of clearance markdowns and promotions needed compared to the prior year to clear through spring seasonal product. Unfavorable category mix shifts and a shift in the timing of shortage recognition were partially offset by better inbound freight charges from the company’s costs savings efforts. Shortage in the second quarter of 2023 was informed by a June physical inventory count in certain categories.Delivery expense as a percent of net sales decreased 50 basis points from the prior year primarily due to improved carrier rates from contract renegotiations as well as lower fuel costs and lower vendor direct volume.Selling, general and administrative (""SG&amp;A"") expense of $2.0 billion, a $31 million decrease.SG&amp;A expense as a percent of total revenue was 37.5%, 300 basis points higher compared to the second quarter of 2022, reflecting the decline in sales year-over-year.Financial HighlightsAll amounts in millions except percentages and per share figuresSecond Quarter20232022Net sales$5,130$5,600Other revenue$150$234Comparable SalesOwned(8.2%)Owned-plus-licensed(7.3%)Gross margin$1,954$2,178Gross margin rate38.1%38.9%Selling, general and administrative expenses$1,980$2,011Net Income (loss)$(22)$275Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA)$221$614Diluted earnings (loss) per share (EPS)$(0.08)$0.99Adjusted Net income$71$277Adjusted EBITDA$347$616Adjusted Diluted EPS$0.26$1.00Merchandise inventories$4,129$4,6102023 GuidanceIn light of ongoing macroeconomic pressures and uncertainty on when those will abate, the company continues to take a cautious approach on the consumer. The company is reaffirming its annual sales and earnings outlook. Better-than-expected second quarter gross margin, SG&amp;A and interest expense, and a lower annual share count, are expected to fully offset reduced annual credit card revenue and asset sale gain assumptions. The company’s annual shortage assumption has not materially changed from the prior outlook and remains elevated compared to recent historical levels.Consistent with the company’s prior outlook, its earnings outlook includes the benefit of an incremental $200 million of cost savings identified as part of ongoing expense management that is favorably expected to impact both gross margin and SG&amp;A expense. The full updated outlook for 2023, presented on a 53-week basis unless otherwise noted, can be found in the presentation posted to macysinc.com/investors.Guidance as of August 22, 2023Guidance as of June 1, 2023Net salesunchanged$22.8 billion to $23.2 billionComparable owned-plus-licensed sales change (52 week basis)unchangedDown 7.5% to down 6% versus 2022Adjusted diluted earnings per share*unchanged$2.70 - $3.20* Adjusted diluted EPS does not consider the impact of any potential future share repurchases associated with the company’s current share repurchase authorization.The company does not provide reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP measures of comparable owned plus licensed sales change and adjusted diluted earnings per share to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the timing and amount of excluded items are unreasonably difficult to fully and accurately estimate.

The income tax effective rates for the 13 and 26 weeks ended July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022 were impacted primarily by the effect of state and local taxes.(4)Gross margin is defined as net sales less cost of sales.(5)Restricted cash of $3 million has been included with cash and cash equivalents as of July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022.MACY’S, INC.Important Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThe company reports its financial results in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures provide users of the company's financial information with additional useful information in evaluating operating performance. Management believes that providing supplemental changes in comparable sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis, which includes adjusting for the impact of comparable sales of departments licensed to third parties, assists in evaluating the company's ability to generate sales growth, whether through owned businesses or departments licensed to third parties, and in evaluating the impact of changes in the manner in which certain departments are operated. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) is a non-GAAP financial measure which the company believes provides meaningful information about its operational efficiency by excluding the impact of changes in tax law and structure, debt levels and capital investment. In addition, management believes that excluding certain items from EBITDA, net income and diluted earnings per share that are not associated with the company’s core operations and that may vary substantially in frequency and magnitude from period-to-period provides useful supplemental measures that assist in evaluating the company's ability to generate earnings and to more readily compare these metrics between past and future periods.The company does not provide reconciliations of the forward-looking non-GAAP measures of comparable owned plus licensed sales change and adjusted diluted earnings per share to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP measures because the timing and amount of excluded items are unreasonably difficult to fully and accurately estimate. For the same reasons, the company is unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could be material to future results.Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed as supplementing, and not as an alternative or substitute for, the company's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Certain of the items that may be excluded or included in non-GAAP financial measures may be significant items that could impact the company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows and should therefore be considered in assessing the company's actual and future financial condition and performance. Additionally, the amounts received by the company on account of sales of departments licensed to third parties are limited to commissions received on such sales. The methods used by the company to calculate its non-GAAP financial measures may differ significantly from methods used by other companies to compute similar measures. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures presented herein may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other companies.MACY’S, INC.Important Information Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures(All amounts in millions except percentages and per share figures)Changes in Comparable SalesComparable Sales vs. 13 Weeks Ended July 30, 2022Macy's, Inc.Macy'sBloomingdale'sDecrease in comparable sales on an owned basis (Note 6)(8.2%)(9.2%)(2.7%)Impact of departments licensed to third parties (Note 7)0.9%1.0%0.1%Decrease in comparable sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis(7.3%)(8.2%)(2.6%)Comparable Sales vs. 26 Weeks Ended July 30, 2022Macy's, Inc.Macy'sBloomingdale'sDecrease in comparable sales on an owned basis (Note 6)(8.1%)(8.9%)(3.3%)Impact of departments licensed to third parties (Note 7)0.9%0.8%(0.1%)Decrease in comparable sales on an owned-plus-licensed basis(7.2%)(8.1%)(3.4%)Notes:(6)Represents the period-to-period percentage change in net sales from stores in operation for both the entire 13 and 26 weeks ended July 29, 2023 and July 30, 2022. Such calculation includes all digital sales and excludes commissions from departments licensed to third parties. Stores impacted by a natural disaster or undergoing significant expansion or shrinkage remain in the comparable sales calculation unless the store, or material portion of the store, is closed for a significant period of time. Definitions and calculations of comparable sales may differ among companies in the retail industry.(7)Represents the impact of including the sales of departments licensed to third parties occurring in stores in operation throughout the year presented and the immediately preceding year and all online sales in the calculation of comparable sales. Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s license third parties to operate certain departments in their stores and online and receive commissions from these third parties based on a percentage of their net sales, while Bluemercury does not participate in licensed businesses. In its financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP, the company includes these commissions (rather than sales of the departments licensed to third parties) in its net sales. The company does not, however, include any amounts in respect of licensed department sales (or any commissions earned on such sales) in its comparable sales in accordance with GAAP (i.e., on an owned basis). The amounts of commissions earned on sales of departments licensed to third parties are not material to its net sales for the periods presented.Non-GAAP financial measures, excluding certain items below, are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP measure as follows:EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are reconciled to GAAP net income.Adjusted net income is reconciled to GAAP net income.Adjusted diluted earnings per share is reconciled to GAAP diluted earnings per share.EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA13 Weeks EndedJuly 29, 202313 Weeks EndedJuly 30, 2022Net income (loss)$(22)$275Interest expense, net3642Federal, state and local income tax (benefit) expense(8)89Depreciation and amortization215208EBITDA221614Impairment, restructuring and other costs42Settlement charges122—Adjusted EBITDA$347$61626 Weeks EndedJuly 29, 202326 Weeks EndedJuly 30, 2022Net income$133$561Interest expense, net7389Losses on early retirement of debt—31Federal, state and local income tax expense48195Depreciation and amortization433413EBITDA6871,289Impairment, restructuring and other costs610Settlement charges122—Adjusted EBITDA$815$1,299Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share13 Weeks EndedJuly 29, 202313 Weeks EndedJuly 30, 2022NetIncome(Loss)DilutedEarnings (Loss)Per ShareNetIncomeDilutedEarningsPer ShareAs reported$(22)$(0.08)$275$0.99Impairment, restructuring and other costs40.0120.01Settlement charges1220.44——Income tax impact of certain items identified above(33)(0.11)——As adjusted to exclude certain items above$71$0.26$277$1.0026 Weeks EndedJuly 29, 202326 Weeks EndedJuly 30, 2022NetIncomeDilutedEarningsPer ShareNetIncomeDilutedEarningsPer ShareAs reported$133$0.48$561$1.97Impairment, restructuring and other costs60.01100.04Settlement charges1220.44——Losses on early retirement of debt——310.11Income tax impact of certain items identified above(33)(0.11)(10)(0.04)As adjusted to exclude certain items above$228$0.82$592$2.08View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230822437215/en/ContactsMedia – Chris Grams communications@macys.com Investors – Pamela Quintiliano investors@macys.com]"

VEEV has been gaining from its strong product portfolio. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter fiscal 2024 performance and strong product adoption are expected to contribute further. Stiff competition and forex volatility persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has lost 12.7% against 7.9% growth of the industry and a 6% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned provider of cloud-based software applications and data solutions for the life sciences industry has a market capitalization of $29.96 billion. The company projects 20.3% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 8.3% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: We are optimistic about Veeva Systems’ unique solutions, which include Veeva Vault, Veeva CRM (customer relationship management), Veeva Network and Veeva OpenData. In June, the company announced the expansion of its business consulting services to help life sciences organizations achieve greater speed and efficiency across the product development lifecycle.In May, Veeva Systems announced the availability of Veeva Link MedTech.Product Adoption: We are upbeat about Veeva Systems registering a robust adoption for its products over the past few months. In July, the company announced that Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, is using Veeva Vault MedInquiry as its global medical information management system.In May, Veeva Systems announced that Lotus Clinical Research expanded its partnership with Veeva Systems and broadened its adoption of Veeva Vault Clinical Suite to strengthen its service delivery and efficiency.Strong Q1 Results: Veeva Systems’ solid first-quarter fiscal 2024 results buoy optimism. The company saw an uptick in the overall top line and robust performances by both segments. The company continued to benefit from its flagship Vault platform. Veeva Systems’ continued strength in its Commercial Solutions, with new small-sized to mid-sized customer additions and expansions in Veeva Commercial Cloud, were also seen.Story continuesDownsidesForex Volatility: Veeva Systems derives a major share of its revenues from international operations. Some of its international agreements provide payment denominated in local currencies and the majority of its local costs are also denominated in local currencies. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies may impact its operating results when converted into U.S. dollars.Stiff Competition: Veeva Systems operates in a highly competitive market. In new sales cycles within the company’s largest product categories, it competes with other cloud-based solutions from providers that make applications for the life sciences industry. The company’s Commercial Cloud and Veeva Vault application suites also compete to replace client-server-based legacy solutions offered by large companies and other smaller application providers.Estimate TrendVeeva Systems is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024.

118,0b0a8530-f7fa-3fbe-9c86-b9f0635ad4c6,MAS,2023-08-22,We Like Masco's (NYSE:MAS) Returns And Here's How They're Trending,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mascos-nyse-mas-returns-heres-181748689.html,1692641868,STORY,['MAS'],"[What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Masco's (NYSE:MAS) look very promising so lets take a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on Masco is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.37 = US$1.3b ÷ (US$5.3b - US$1.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Masco has an ROCE of 37%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 15% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Masco roceIn the above chart we have measured Masco's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Masco here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Masco Tell Us?Masco's ROCE growth is quite impressive. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 25% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTo sum it up, Masco is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. And investors seem to expect more of this going forward, since the stock has rewarded shareholders with a 57% return over the last five years. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Masco can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.One more thing to note, we've identified   2 warning signs  with Masco and understanding these should be part of your investment process.Masco is not the only stock earning high returns.

But it’s not too late to find high-quality S&amp;P 500 stocks selling at compelling prices in August 2023.How should an investor choose among various undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks? All seven of these picks have a strong upside today.Adding to that, they are all 5-star stocks, according to Morningstar’s analysts as well. That makes these seven undervalued S&amp;P 500 stocks great selections going forward.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVerizon Communications (VZ)Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is one of three primary mobile phone carriers in the United States.Investors have long gravitated to this industry for its defensive nature and high dividend yields. That paradigm has come under fire lately, however. After a debt-fueled spending spree, AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) was forced to slash its dividend and divest assets recently.Traders have assumed that a similar fate will befall Verizon. Even though Verizon’s profits have been stable and it has maintained its dividend, shares have fallen by about 40% from their prior highs. That’s a massive move for a generally low-volatility blue chip stock such as this one.It’s true that higher interest rates hurt heavily indebted companies such like telecoms. And Verizon is spending heavily on 5G rollouts and other network improvements. But there’s light at the end of the tunnel as spending will finally decline in 2024.All told, VZ stock seems way too beaten up at current depressed levels. Shares go for just 7x forward earnings and offer a 7.8% dividend yield.PayPal Holdings (PYPL)PayPal logo and front of headquarters. PYPL stockSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comPayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) is an online payment platform. Known for its namesake payment processing service, it has also expanded into ancillary and related services like money transfers.PYPL stock soared to unprecedented heights early on in the pandemic. With global e-commerce booming and brick-and-mortar retailers rushing to install contactless payments solutions, PayPal seemed to be winning on all sides. But as the economy reopened, those tailwinds disappeared and growth rates plunged. And with it, so went PYPL stock.Story continuesWhat a fall it’s been. The stock is down from a peak of more than $300/share to just $63 today. With that sort of decline, you’d be forgiven for thinking that the business had entirely collapsed. And yet, the truth isn’t nearly so dour.Analysts see PayPal growing revenues by 8% this year and earnings per share rising fully by 19% for 2023. Further, double-digit gains are anticipated for 2024. PayPal stock didn’t make much sense at $300 — that was an inexplicable valuation. But, a few years from now, the current depressed valuation may seem equally misguided. At just 12 times forward earnings, and with those earnings continuing to grow rapidly, PYPL stock is a bargain here.Global Payments (GPN)Global Payments office building in Brantford, Ontario, Canada. GPN stock.Source: JHVEPhoto / ShutterstockPaypal isn’t the only payment company unfairly blasted over the past 18 months. Global Payments (NYSE:GPN) shares fell as much as 43% from their 2021 peak to the recent lows.That comes even as Global Payments has continued to grow revenues at 7% annually and earnings at a low double-digit annualized rate. With the share price decline, Global Payments is now going for 12 times forward earnings.This is a huge opportunity. Global Payments is a broadly diversified business offering merchant solutions, issuer services and consumer solutions. That is to say, Global Payments can handle card acceptance, security, accounting and reporting functions, chargeback resolution and a variety of other functions.The company is deeply integrated into merchants’ information technology systems with heavy investments in omnichannel support, making it a leader as retailers pursue sales across various brick-and-mortar and online platforms. GPN stock rallied recently after a far better-than-expected Q2 earnings report. Even so, shares still go for less than $130, whereas Morningstar’s Brett Horn sees fair value at $179 per share.Estee Lauder (EL)An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comEstee Lauder (NYSE:EL) is one of the world’s leading cosmetics companies. Over the years, it has grown tremendously, positioning itself as an accessible luxury.Estee Lauder fared unexpectedly well over the past few years. Despite the pandemic and the temporary closure of shopping centers, Estee Lauder sales held up. The firm’s strong investments in direct-to-consumer and alternative sales channels made it well-positioned to withstand the shake-up. And, as the economy reopened, demand surged as folks wanted to look good coming out of lockdown.That momentum has abruptly reversed in 2023. Weakness with the Chinese consumer market, in particular, has caused Estee Lauder to repeatedly miss estimates. However, with EL stock down 40% over the past 12 months, economic concerns are more than baked into the cake at this point.Realty Income (O)realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browserSource: ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) is a leading triple-net REIT. Triple nets are a type of real estate trust where the tenant — rather than the landlord — pays key expenses such as taxes, insurance, and maintenance. These fare well in inflationary environments as the landlord isn’t on the hook for sharp increases in those costs.Regardless of this advantage, O stock has sold off along with the rest of the REIT industry. Higher interest rates hurt real estate owners since they have to pay out more interest on the debts used to fund property purchases. In addition, investors tend to demand higher dividend yields off their REITs to compensate for elevated interest rates. In a world where a bank Certificate of Deposit pays 5%, investors can be more choosy about their dividend stocks.That said, with O stock down 22% over the past year, the selling has gone too far. Shares now yield 5.2%. And Morningstar’s Kevin Brown sees fair value up at $76, a considerable increase from today’s $58 price.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comAlbemarle (NYSE:ALB) is a leading specialty chemical company. It produces bromine, lithium and other such goods.Despite being in a volatile industry, Albemarle has built an admirable track record. Indeed, it is a Dividend Aristocrat, having raised its dividend for more than 25 consecutive years.Shares have sold off sharply in 2023 amid a downturn in demand from China. However, in the bigger picture, electric vehicles continue to take market share, and the batteries needed to power them will consume tons of lithium. In other words, Albemarle is a long-term growth stock currently on sale at a sharp discount.China just surprised the market with an unexpected rate cut. That could be the catalyst to get the Chinese industrial sector going again and lift shares of beaten-down commodity producers such as Albemarle.Tyson Foods (TSN)The corporate headquarters of Tyson Foods (TSN) in Chicago, Illinois. undervalued stocksSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.comTyson Foods (NYSE:TSN) is a packaged foods company focused on meat and meat products.The company’s fortunes have taken a downturn recently due to soaring inflation. As the price of agricultural goods rose with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, livestock costs also jumped, lowering profit margins. As Tyson is largely a commodity producer selling meat at market prices, it doesn’t have much operational flexibility.Thankfully for Tyson, things are now turning in its favor. Grain prices have plummeted as world agricultural conditions have started to normalize. Corn, for example, has fallen more than 40% since its 2022 peak. That should lead to better livestock availability and better results for Tyson.TSN stock, for its own part, is off by a third over the past year. Earnings will be depressed in 2023, and it’s understandable why short-term traders are selling. Longer-term investors, however, are getting a good deal, and there’s a 3.5% dividend yield for shareholders while they wait.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in VZ, EL, GPN, and ALB stock.

124,541f6933-c561-3bdd-864f-3e23baa1b9f5,MA,2023-08-22,Affirm (AFRM) to Post Q4 Earnings: What You Should Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/affirm-afrm-post-q4-earnings-143600749.html,1692628560,STORY,"['AFRM', 'MA', 'V', 'WU']","[Affirm Holdings, Inc. AFRM is set to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 24, after the closing bell.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 loss per share of 86 cents suggests a 32.3% plunge from the prior-year loss of 65 cents. The estimate remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues of $404.2 million indicates an 11% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Affirm beat on earnings in one of the trailing four quarters and missed thrice, the average negative surprise being 8.5%. This is depicted in the graph below.Affirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Affirm Holdings, Inc. QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at AFRM’s previous-quarter performance first.Q3 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, this leading payment network’s adjusted loss per share of 69 cents was 24.2% narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, thanks to improved virtual card network revenues and interest income. However, the positives were partially offset by deteriorated servicing and merchant network revenues and rising operating expenses.Now, let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement.Q4 Factors to NoteThe company expects the weighted average shares outstanding to be 300 million in the to-be-reported quarter. Travel and entertainment-related spendings are expected to have been resilient in the quarter under review. This, in turn, is likely to have augmented the strength of active merchants and consumers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for merchant network revenues is pegged at $130.1 million, indicating a jump of 10.1% from a year ago. Also, the consensus mark for servicing income indicates a 4.4% year-over-year increase to $22.5 million.The sales figures from the virtual card networks are anticipated to have risen. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for virtual card network revenues is pegged at $32.6 million, indicating a 3.3% year-over-year rise. Affirm anticipates fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 GMV to be $5.20-$5.35 billion, signaling a jump from $4.4 billion a year ago.Story continuesThe consensus mark for interest income in the fiscal fourth quarter is pegged at $186.6 million, indicating a 35.6% jump from the previous-year quarter’s $137.6 million, primarily due to the high interest rate environment.The above-mentioned factors are expected to have positioned the company for year-over-year top-line growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. However, the positives are likely to have been partially offset by lower gains on sales of loans and higher operating costs.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for gain on sales of loans suggests a 41.5% year-over-year decline to $32.4 million. The company expects transaction costs to be within $245-$255 million, significantly higher than the year-ago level of $179.8 million.Also, operating costs are likely to have increased in the quarter under review due to higher technology and data analytics, and funding costs, affecting the bottom line. Increased processing and servicing costs, as a result of growing volumes, are anticipated to have boosted the operating costs, reducing profits and making an earnings beat uncertain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Affirm this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company currently has an Earnings ESP of -18.15%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at a loss of $1.02 per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 86 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Affirm currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.How Other Stocks PerformedHere are some companies from the Business Services space that have already reported earnings for the June quarter: Mastercard Incorporated MA, Visa Inc. V and The Western Union Company WU.Mastercard reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.89 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.8%. The quarterly results gained from strong consumer spending, specifically across the travel sector, and an enhanced services suite. Robust growth in cross-border volume also contributed to the upside. However, the performance was partly offset by an escalating operating cost level.Visa reported third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings of $2.16 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.4%. Its solid quarterly results benefited from higher payments, cross-border volumes and processed transactions. Steady cross-border travel growth and higher-than-expected data processing aided the results, partially offset by increased costs.Western Union reported second-quarter 2023 earnings per share of 51 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 34.2%. WU’s earnings were supported by growth in business originating from Iraq, inflation in Argentina and better-than-expected C2C transactions. Evolve 2025’s momentum and strength in the Middle East business further benefited the results, partially offset by higher expenses.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

126,4d0d7b67-8013-3bf7-bdb7-c564d017ea6c,QCOM,2023-08-22,20 Biggest Augmented Reality And VR Companies In The World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-biggest-augmented-reality-vr-195138941.html,1692647498,STORY,"['SNAP', 'META', 'AAPL', 'AXON', 'AMD', 'ADBE', 'TXN', 'PTC', 'BIDU', 'QCOM', 'TTWO', 'HPE', 'NTDOY', 'ANSS']","[In this article, we will talk about the 20 biggest augmented reality and virtual reality companies in the world. We will also discuss the emerging trends and key players in the extended reality industry. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Biggest Augmented Reality And VR Companies In The World.Extended reality is an umbrella term encompassing all immersive technologies, including augmented, virtual, and mixed reality. Immersive technologies combine or replace our physical reality with a virtual one. In augmented reality, the user experiences virtual information intermingled with the real world. Instead of being isolated from the physical world, the user experiences the interplay of virtual elements like images, animations, and information with their actual surroundings. Snapchat by Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) and Pokémon Go by Niantic are some of the most well-known examples of augmented reality. On March 23, Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) launched a separate division for businesses, AR Enterprise Services (ARES), that facilitates them to build AR features for their websites and apps. As of March, almost 250 million people interact with AR on Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) daily, posing a good opportunity for enterprises to correspond with their customers. The first product by ARES is Shopping Suite, which lets consumers virtually try different products and find their right fit before buying. Businesses can optimize and manage their augmented reality assets and integrations and measure performance analytics using this feature. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is one of the leading names in bringing AR to the mainstream.  In virtual reality, the user is fully immersed in the digitally created environment. The user feels transported into an alternate reality completely disconnected from the real one. Virtual reality requires the user to put on a VR headset, whereas augmented reality can be accessed using a screen like a mobile or tablet. Mixed reality merges the physical and virtual worlds.  Story continuesThe Extended Reality Industry OutlookExtended reality technology has found numerous applications in our everyday life. It can be used in entertainment, education, training, estate tours, and many other areas. In healthcare, it is used to train medical professionals in simulation. It helps them visualize the patient's organs prior to surgery and target organs better. The surgeons then operate, greatly reducing the risks involved. According to a report by Knowledge Sourcing Intelligence LLP, the extended reality market was valued at $11.514 billion in 2021 and has been estimated to reach $95.438 billion by 2028, growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 35.27% through the forecasted period.The popularity of extended reality is constantly rising; however, the growth has been relatively slow. The two main factors for this slow growth include privacy concerns as well as the high cost of production. The VR headset needs to be compact but efficient, thus increasing the production cost. The high cost implies fewer people could afford it, and sales would be low. Thus developments and advancements in the hardware segment would catalyze the market growth for extended reality. Furthermore, to create a truly immersive experience large amounts of information from the user's environment is collected. This extensive flux of information creates a privacy concern. North America currently has the biggest share in the global extended reality market. The main reason for this large claim is the presence of most of the key players in this region. Companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) are all present in this region. However, the Asia Pacific region is expected to grow rapidly in the future. The rapid boost in technology development, 5G, and the use of smartphones would be the main contributors to this growth. The pandemic also catalyzed the popularity of extended reality products as the shift towards remote work caused a surge in demand. The gaming industry especially poses a great opportunity for the growth of extended reality technology in this region. According to a report by Technavio, the Asia Pacific region is estimated to contribute 37% to the growth of the global extended reality market from 2023 through 2027. On June 1, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) announced that the company will soon launch the next generation of its mixed-reality headset, the Meta Quest 3. The new generation would be 40% thinner and have enhanced graphics performance than the previous product. The device will be launched in a few months, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has promised to give more details at the company's annual AR/VR conference on September 27. VR headsets are currently used predominantly in gaming. However, companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) have been trying to market it as a productivity and fitness tool. On June 5, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced their extended reality headset, Vision Pro. The Vision Pro starts at $3,499 which is almost three times the price of Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) headset. The Vision Pro uses a new chip, R1, that claims to process information from its sensors faster than the blink of an eye. The headset has a transparent display allowing the user to still see their environment while interacting with virtual elements. The users can select options by just blinking or tapping their fingers together. On June 5, Erik Woodring, equity research executive director at Morgan Stanley, in a CNBC interview talked about the future of the product and gave valuable insight into how the extended reality market would grow with time. Here are some comments from his interview:""I did partially (use the word consumer as opposed to enterprise) because I think the early use cases are going to be more on the consumer side; that's not to say we're excluding the enterprise market at all. There are use cases that exist today in AR and VR and that will exist in the future with AR VR in the enterprise, but think of Apple as largely a consumer brand getting into the enterprise. I think of the same way when it comes to mixed reality headsets, the consumer is the primary customer today, the enterprise will be a customer tomorrow, but the opportunity today is bigger for the consumer.""In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), some other big tech names that are making hefty investments in AR and VR include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).20 Biggest Augmented Reality And VR Companies In The WorldBairachnyi Dmitry/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To make our list of the 20 biggest augmented reality and VR companies in the world, we sifted through various AR/VR ETFs and identified their top holdings.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Williams-Sonoma (WSM) earns a Zacks Rank #3 two days from its next quarterly earnings release on August 23, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.77 a share.Williams-Sonoma's Earnings ESP sits at 2.21%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $2.77 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.71.WSM is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Expedia (EXPE) as well.Slated to report earnings on November 2, 2023, Expedia holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $5.16 a share 73 days from its next quarterly update.For Expedia, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.15 is 0.21%.Story continuesWSM and EXPE's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

To skip the investment philosophy and details of Michael Burry’s Q2 bets, go directly to 5 Stocks To Buy According to Michael Burry.Michael Burry is one of the most prominent investors in the world. He was one of the first few to predict the subprime mortgage crisis which led to the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-2009. He made a personal profit of $100 million and generated $700 million for his investors by shorting the mortgage bond market. Initially, Burry’s investors were quite pessimistic about his decision and wanted to withdraw their investments. However, Michael Burry defended himself in his third quarter 2005 investor letter by saying:“Sometimes, markets err big time. Markets erred when they gave America Online the currency to buy Time Warner. They erred when they bet against George Soros and for the British Pound. And they are erring right now by continuing to float along as if the most significant credit bubble history has ever seen does not exist. Opportunities are rare, and large opportunities on which one can put nearly unlimited capital to work at tremendous potential returns are even more rare. Selectively shorting the most problematic mortgage-backed securities in history today amounts to just such an opportunity.”Michael Burry closed his firm in 2008 after recording returns of 489.34% since its inception in 2000. Michael Burry reopened his firm by the name of Scion Asset Management in 2013. Since then, Burry has been making long-short value bets in the stock market.As of the second quarter of 2023, Michael Burry is shorting the stock market again as he purchased $886.560 million and $739 million of SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust and Invesco QQQ ETF puts, respectively. At the time of writing on the August 17 market close, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF is down by almost 4% in the last month while Invesco QQQ ETF is down by over 7% in the last month. Analysts still have mixed sentiments regarding the S&amp;P 500 (tracked by SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF). Goldman Sachs raised its end-of-year target for the S&amp;P 500 from 4,000 to 4,500, which is 4,365 at the time of writing. On the other hand, a May 23 poll by Reuters shows that 43 Wall Street strategists expect a decline by the end of the year to 4,150.Story continuesScion Asset Management Stock Bets in Q2Apart from shorting the two ETFs, Michael Burry sold out 15 stocks, most of which were bank stocks, including First Republic Bank (NYSE:FRC), Western Alliance Bancorporation (NYSE:WAL), and Capital One Financial Corp. (NYSE:COF).

(NYSE:NEX) and Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI). According to its 13F filings, the firm's portfolio was worth approximately $1.74 billion in Q2, compared to $107 million in the previous quarter.

The company has a nearly 8% dividend yield with enough net cash (cash minus debt) on the balance sheet to cover the dividend for almost five years. The company trades at 1.7x operating profits, which means the market is already expecting a likely drop in cash flow. Still, the shares appear to be worth meaningfully more than where they trade, and management is heavily aligned with stockholders with a 14% stake. They share our view that the valuation is compelling, as the company plans on repurchasing ~3% of shares outstanding this year.”6.

Shares performed well in the first quarter following strong year-end business results and expectations for strong growth in 2023.We remain optimistic about the prospects for MGM because:We expect growth prospects in Las Vegas, which represent approximately 65% of the company’s cash flow, to remain strong due to strength in business group and convention activity, an increase in international visitation, and events throughout the calendar year (concerts, shows, and sports such as Formula 1 racing), which should appeal to leisure travelers…” (Click here to read the full text) Click to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks To Buy According to Michael Burry. Suggested articles:10 Korean Stocks Listed in the U.S.10 Best Consumer Staples ETFsStanley Druckenmiller 13F Portfolio: Top 15 StocksDisclosure.

Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Nov 30, 2026.Details of the DealValued at $117 million, the contract was offered by the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. Per the terms of the deal, Javelin JV will procure lightweight command launch units for Javelin missiles.Work related to this deal will be carried out in Tucson, AZ.Importance of JavelinJavelin is the world's first one-man-portable, fire-and-forget, multipurpose missile system. This compact and lightweight missile enhances direct-fire capability against armored vehicles, buildings and field fortifications.This combat-proven weapon system boasts a reliability rate of more than 94%. It can be deployed from multiple platforms and used in all weather, day or night operations. The system’s Command Launch Unit performs surveillance, allowing a gunner to see targets.The fact that Javelin has been used in Afghanistan and Iraq in more than 5,000 engagements surely reflects the solid demand that it enjoys in the missile market. The latest contract win by RTX is a bright example of that and such contract wins tend to boost the company’s revenue growth in the coming quarters.What’s Ahead?Increasing geopolitical tensions worldwide have prompted nations to strengthen their defense systems manifold. With rapid technological upgrades, missile defense has steadily become pivotal in a nation’s defense strategy. With the United States being the world’s largest weapon supplier and RTX being a prominent U.S. missile maker, the increased missile defense adoption by nations provides the company with solid growth opportunities.Looking ahead, per a report by the Research and Markets firm, the global rocket and missile market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4.5% during the 2022-2030 period to reach $84.2 million by 2030.Story continuesSuch massive growth projections indicate solid opportunities for RTX, which has a handful of combat proven missiles in its product portfolio, like Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Guidance Enhanced Missile (GEM-T), the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), Tomahawk, Standard Missile 2 (SM-2) and a few more, in addition to the Javelin missile.Peer ProspectsConsidering the solid growth opportunities offered by the global rocket and missile market, other major defense primes like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed LMT and Boeing BA that specialize in developing technologically advanced missiles should also benefit.Northrop Grumman’s missile defense program includes AGM-88E advanced anti-radiation guided missiles, the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent weapon system and rocket propulsion systems. In August 2022, the company had been chosen by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency to lead the Homeland Missile Defense Program.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 sales implies an improvement of 5.6% from the 2022 reported figure.Lockheed’s missile defense program includes the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) and Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense air and missile defense programs. It also manufactures the Multiple Launch Rocket System, the Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile and Javelin tactical missile programs alongside other tactical missiles.LMT boasts a four-quarter average earnings surprise of 5.04%. The stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.5%.For almost 25 years, Boeing-built and supported air and missile defense systems have been protecting the nation, warfighters, allies and international partners against threats ranging from intercontinental ballistic missiles to hostile aircraft. BA’s missile and missile portfolio includes Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense, Avenger, Ground-Based Midcourse Defense and PAC-3 Missile Seeker.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boeing’s 2023 sales indicates an improvement of 19.3% from the 2022 reported figure. The stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 4%.Price PerformanceIn the past year, RTX’s shares have lost 6.5% compared with the industry’s 6.4% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the other hand, shares of Lockheed have rallied 4.1% against the industry's 6.4% decline in the past year.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankBoth RTX and LMT currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are up 4.1%, 13.8% and 27%, respectively. However, volatility has shown its ugly face once again in August owing to both internal and external factors.Consequently, month to date, the S&amp;P 500 Index is down 4.8%. Last week, the S&amp;P 500 fell 2.1%, marking its third-straight weekly loss, for the first time since February. The index’s last three-week loss of 4.6% is its biggest decline since the three weeks ended Mar 10.Nevertheless, the long-term trend of U.S. stock markets remains bullish. The inflation rate is dwindling steadily since June 2022. Fundamentals of the economy remain strong with a resilient labor market and solid consumer spending. These developments have brightened the chance of the Fed’s so-called “soft landing” and reduces the possibility of a near-term recession.At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in dividend-paying S&amp;P 500 stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that have provided positive returns in the past month with more upside left. If the index’s downturn continues, dividend will act as a regular income stream. If the benchmark resumes its northward journey, favorable Zacks Rank will capture the upsides.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five such stocks with strong potential for the rest of 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our pick sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last seven days. ETN has a current dividend yield of 1.6%.Pentair plc PNR anticipates volumes in the pool business to remain weak this year due to the ongoing inventory correction.

(NYSE:BAX) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/88-institutional-ownership-baxter-international-180638247.html,1692641198,STORY,['BAX'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Baxter International's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 16 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownershipOwnership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stockA look at the shareholders of Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 88% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Baxter International. View our latest analysis for Baxter International ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Baxter International?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Baxter International. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Baxter International's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Baxter International is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc. with 13% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 12% of common stock, and T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. holds about 4.6% of the company stock.A closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 16 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Baxter InternationalThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Baxter International Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$58m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 12% stake in Baxter International. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Like risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Baxter International   (of which 1 is potentially serious!) you should know about.Ultimately the future is most important.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the economic contributions of the Hispanic or Latino community and head over directly to the 5 Cities with the Most Hispanics.Hispanics are Americans who trace their roots to Spain, Mexico, Latin America, and the Spanish-speaking islands of the Caribbean. They are the largest racial or ethnic minority in the United States – with an estimated population of 62.9 million as of July 2021 according to the Census Bureau – which equates to 18.9% of the total population in the country.A 2022 report by the Joint Economic Committee stated the total economic output of the Hispanic or Latino population of the United States to be an estimated $2 trillion. This includes five-million businesses that contribute $800 billion every year to the national economy. Number of Hispanic-owned businesses between 2012 and 2017 in the country grew by 14%, which was more than twice the national average. According to McKinsey &amp; Company, they also account for the fastest growing portion of the United States GDP. So much so that if the American Latinos had a country of their own, they would have the third highest GDP growth in the past decade after China and India.California, Texas, Florida, Arizona and New Mexico are the states with the highest Hispanic population. These states also have the highest concentration of Latino-owned businesses. In California, 85,000 of the total 764,000 businesses are owned by Hispanics or Latinos, which is equivalent to over 11% of all businesses in the state. These businesses provide jobs to an estimated 670,000 people and contribute $25 billion towards the state economy. These figures were shared by the Latino Policy and Politics Institute in August 2023.Hispanic Representation in Leading CompaniesDespite making up nearly one-fifths of the overall population of the US, Hispanics are underrepresented in boards of Fortune 500 companies and C-suites of corporate America – with less than 5% of top management positions in companies being held by Hispanics. Only 1% of all board seats are held by Latina women. 69% of the Fortune 1000 companies in 2021 did not have a single director from a Hispanic background. Only 20 of Fortune 500 companies had CEOs of Hispanic descent.Story continuesThis includes Juan Ricardo Luciano, the CEO of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), which is a food processing and commodities trading company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) was ranked 35th in the 2023 Fortune 500 list, having a revenue of $101 billion in 2022. Luciano grew up in Argentina and studied engineering at the Buenos Aires Institute of Technology. He worked 25 years for Dow Chemical before taking over as the CEO of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) in 2015.One of the world’s most diversified and largest healthcare products companies, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is also headed by a Latino, Joaquin Duato, who is the CEO and Chairman of the Board at the company. Duato joined Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) 34 years ago and served as the Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee before becoming CEO in 2022. During the coronavirus pandemic, Duato spearheaded Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)’s efforts in ensuring employee health and that life-saving medicines including the company’s Covid-19 vaccine reached those who were in need.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)’s Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta, was born in Spain and completed his undergraduate and master’s degrees from the ESADE Business School in Barcelona. He is the first Spanish to be the chief executive officer of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and has held the position since 2018. Laguarta previously oversaw PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)’s operations in Europe and Africa before moving to the United States.MethodologyWe have ranked 20 cities with the most Hispanics using figures released by the Census Bureau in its 2021 American Community Survey (ACS).

Yahoo Finance's Anjalee khemlani is following the story and joins us now for more. Anje, the details, please.ANJAEE KHEMLANI: Absolutely, Jared. So we know, of course, that the World Health Organization has been tracking a number of variants. And here in the US, we're starting to see an uptick of one, that's EG5, nicknamed Araiza unofficially or Eris unofficially as well as the BA.2.86. That is another one that has caused some concern-- EG5 of concern because of the fact that it is a little bit more immune evasive.But that is all in the contributing to the story of these vaccine makers up on the news that there is something to be concerned about. We know that they have all demonstrated some efficacy against this new variants, even though they have been programmed and formulated to fight the Xb15. If you remember, that was the Omicron variant at the time.This new one EG5, all of these variants that we're seeing are part of that broader sub lineage, that Omicron family. So the expectation is that they should be effective come the fall when they do need those shots. Now it's important to note that the three vaccine players Moderna, Pfizer, and Novavax are yet to get approval from the FDA. They're still conducting their efficacy trials and should hear soon.There are some concerns that the rollout might not take place in September as planned, but there still is a timeline of waiting. So we have to wait and see how that all pans out. But as of right now, experts aren't warning that this is necessarily going to drive a surge the way that we've seen in the past during the pandemic, but definitely are seeing an uptick in cases attributable to these new variants. It's something to keep an eye on out for as the fall continues.JARED BLIKRE: So we know you will keep an eye on all of that for us. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani, thank you.]"

Though a favorable trend was observed in the study’s other primary endpoint of overall survival (“OS”), it did not reach statistical significance. The study investigators will test the OS endpoint at a subsequent analysis.The LITESPARK-005 study also achieved its secondary endpoint of statistically significant improvement in the objective response rate (“ORR”). No new safety signals were reported in the study, and the safety profile of Welireg was in line with observations in its previously conducted studies.Merck plans to present these results at a future medical meeting.An oral HIF-2α inhibitor, Welireg is currently approved in the United States and Europe to treat adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (“VHL”) disease who require therapy for associated RCC, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, not requiring immediate surgery.Merck’s shares have lost 1.6% year to date against the industry’s 7.8% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPer management, the LITESPARK-005 is the first late-stage study to show positive results in patients with advanced RCC who received a checkpoint inhibitor and a VEGF-TKI therapy. With a potential label expansion in advanced RCC, Merck aims to introduce Welireg as a new treatment option that can reduce the risk of disease progression or death for an indication with low survival rates.The LITESPARK-005 study is part of Merck's comprehensive late-stage development program on Welireg in RCC. The program consists of three other late-stage studies – LITESPARK-011, LITESPARK-012 and LITESPARK-022. While LITESPARK-011 and LITESPARK-012 evaluate Welireg in the second-line and treatment-naïve advanced disease settings, respectively, LITESPARK-022 evaluates Welireg in the adjuvant setting.Story continuesMerck’s oncology portfolio is highly dependent on Keytruda, its blockbuster anti-PD-1 therapy, which accounted for over 40% of the company’s revenues in second-quarter 2022. With concerns over Keytruda’s potential loss of exclusivity post-2028, a label expansion to drugs like Welireg will enable the company to narrow down its dependence on the anti-PD-1 therapy.Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

AARP joined in the battle, filing an amicus brief on behalf of HHS on Friday. J&amp;J and Bristol have asked for their lawsuits to be merged, and several have asked for summary judgement, which would avoid a drawn-out trial process.Various lists have been published in an attempt to guess which products CMS will target.UBS includes some common assumptions like Merck's diabetes drug Januvia, J&amp;J and Bayer's blood thinner Xarelto, Pfizer (PFE) and Bristol's blood thinner Eliquis, J&amp;J and AbbVie's (ABBV) cancer drug Imbruvica, and Pfizer and Astellas's Xtandi.Bottles and pills of Xarelto, marketed by Janssen Pharmaceutical, sit on a counter at a pharmacy in Provo, Utah, Jan. 9, 2020. (George Frey/REUTERS) (George Frey / reuters)Some of these are listed in the lawsuits brought on by the companies who anticipate being targeted.UBS has also included AstraZeneca's (AZN) Farxiga, Amgen's (AMGN) Enbrel, Astellas's Myrbetriq, and Boehringer Ingelheim's Spiriva, and its Jardiance with Eli Lilly (LLY).Story continuesThe companies will have until Oct. 1 to sign an agreement to begin negotiations with CMS. And in UBS's view, this process actually getting underway could take some pressure off the sector.""Although the beginning of IRA implementation is a watershed moment for the industry, we argue that the next 1-2 steps could see overhang removal for the Pharma sector in the near term,"" UBS said.The lawsuits cite either the First, Fifth, or Eighth Amendments, alleging the powers granted to Medicare by Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act are unconstitutional.""Given that IRA disallows 'administrative and judicial review' of how CMS determines negotiation-eligible drugs and maximum fair prices, lawsuits are challenging the implementation on constitutional grounds,"" UBS wrote.Some legal experts see this strategy as a likely path to the Supreme Court.UBS analysts echoed a similar sentiment, saying the lawsuits, filed in various district courts around the country, could help fast-track the suits to what they called a ""business-friendly"" Supreme Court.The lawsuits citing the First Amendment claim the companies believe their freedom of speech is being taken away as they are only given a negotiation window, but not a chance to opt out of the negotiations.The lawsuits citing the Fifth Amendment claim the lack of option qualifies as government seizure of their property, and the Eighth Amendment was cited for excessive fines — or the penalty that Medicare can levy for noncompliance.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

In some cases, you can identify these statements by forward-looking words or expressions, such as ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""could,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""looking ahead,"" ""may,"" ""plan,"" ""possible,"" ""potential,"" ""project,"" ""should,"" ""going to,"" ""will,"" and similar words or expressions, the negative or plural of such words or expressions and other comparable terminology. Actual results may differ materially from anticipated results. Medtronic does not undertake to update its forward-looking statements or any of the information contained in this press release, including to reflect future events or circumstances.NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURESThis press release contains financial measures, including adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, and organic revenue, which are considered ""non-GAAP"" financial measures under applicable SEC rules and regulations. References to quarterly or annual figures increasing, decreasing or remaining flat are in comparison to fiscal year 2023.Medtronic management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide information useful to investors in understanding the company's underlying operational performance and trends and to facilitate comparisons with the performance of other companies in the med tech industry. Non-GAAP net income and diluted EPS exclude the effect of certain charges or gains that contribute to or reduce earnings but that result from transactions or events that management believes may or may not recur with similar materiality or impact to operations in future periods (Non-GAAP Adjustments). Medtronic generally uses non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate management's review of the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and investors are cautioned that Medtronic may calculate non-GAAP financial measures in a way that is different from other companies. Management strongly encourages investors to review the company's consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are included in the financial schedules accompanying this press release.Medtronic calculates forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures based on internal forecasts that omit certain amounts that would be included in GAAP financial measures. For instance, forward-looking organic revenue growth guidance excludes the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, as well as significant acquisitions or divestitures. Forward-looking diluted non-GAAP EPS guidance also excludes other potential charges or gains that would be recorded as Non-GAAP Adjustments to earnings during the fiscal year. Medtronic does not attempt to provide reconciliations of forward-looking non-GAAP EPS guidance to projected GAAP EPS guidance because the combined impact and timing of recognition of these potential charges or gains is inherently uncertain and difficult to predict and is unavailable without unreasonable efforts. In addition, the company believes such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision and certainty that could be confusing to investors. Such items could have a substantial impact on GAAP measures of financial performance.Contacts:               Erika Winkels             Ryan WeispfenningPublic Relations         Investor Relations+1-763-526-8478         +1-763-505-4626 (PRNewsfoto/Medtronic plc)CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/medtronic-reports-first-quarter-fiscal-2024-financial-results-301906157.htmlSOURCE Medtronic plc]"
151,7a92deb6-448e-3a23-9bcc-50c7da67311a,MDT,2023-08-22,Will Medtronic (MDT) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-mdt-beat-estimates-again-161004874.html,1692634204,STORY,['MDT'],"[If you are looking for a stock that has a solid history of beating earnings estimates and is in a good position to maintain the trend in its next quarterly report, you should consider Medtronic (MDT). This company, which is in the Zacks Medical - Products industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This medical device company has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1.91%.For the most recent quarter, Medtronic was expected to post earnings of $1.56 per share, but it reported $1.57 per share instead, representing a surprise of 0.64%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.26 per share, while it actually produced $1.30 per share, a surprise of 3.17%.Thanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Medtronic lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Medtronic currently has an Earnings ESP of +1.11%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on August 22, 2023.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Medtronic (MDT) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.12 a share, just one day from its upcoming earnings release on August 22, 2023.MDT has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.11%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.12 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11.MDT is just one of a large group of Medical stocks with a positive ESP figure. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on October 26, 2023, Vertex Pharmaceuticals holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $3.94 a share 66 days from its next quarterly update.Story continuesFor Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.93 is 0.21%.MDT and VRTX's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

153,4ca5958a-e0af-395c-8532-f91245b71569,CCI,2023-08-22,The 3 Most Undervalued 5G Stocks to Buy Now: August 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-most-undervalued-5g-stocks-131923515.html,1692105563,STORY,"['QCOM', 'GLW', 'CCI']","[Fifth-generation wireless (5G) is becoming the global standard for wireless networks. But the full rollout of 5G will take several years – and billions of dollars. The takeaway for investors is that there’s still plenty of opportunity to find undervalued 5G stocks.  5G is not just essential in mobile phones. It’s also critical to areas like the Internet of Things (IoT). According to Research and Markets, the global 5G IoT market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 106.67% between 2022 and 2027.  5G will also be critical at the enterprise level. This includes applications such as autonomous driving and the emerging virtual reality sector (e.g. the metaverse). Ericsson (NASDAQ:ERIC) estimates this sector will expand at a CAGR of 25% between now and 2030. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsInvestors can look for undervalued 5G stocks in several areas including the semiconductor market, companies that supply the equipment and infrastructure, as well as real estate investment trusts (REITs). Here are three 5G stocks – one from each of those areas – that are offering investors good value in 2023.  Qualcomm (QCOM)  Source: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.comIn the chip sector, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is an undervalued stock to consider. The company has entered into partnerships with many automakers in an effort to become a significant player in the IoT arena. But when most investors think about Qualcomm, they think of mobile phones. And for good reason. Virtually every mobile phone, likely including the device you’re reading this article on, includes hardware from Qualcomm. In fact, in Qualcomm’s most recent quarter, revenue from the mobile phone sector accounted for $5.3 billion, or 75% of the company’s revenue.  Revenue and earnings are lower on a year-over-year (YOY) basis and that has put pressure on QCOM stock, which is down more than 24% in the last 12 months. However, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 17x earnings, it won’t take much growth for the share price to shoot higher. In the meantime, investors can collect a dividend that currently has a 2.79% yield.  Story continuesCorning (GLW) the corning (GLW) logo and homepage displayed on a mobile phoneSource: madamF / Shutterstock.comCorning (NYSE:GLW) is a leading provider of the fiber-optic cable that will be necessary to build out the 5G infrastructure. In 2022, the company launched its robust TXF fiber that offers features that will set a new industry standard. However, for a number of reasons, Corning’s revenue and earnings have been mostly flat for several years. In July, the company reported weaker YOY earnings due to lower demand from smartphone manufacturers. That’s because these manufacturers are trying to right-size their inventories to reflect lower consumer demand caused by inflation and rising interest rates.  This has shown up in the performance of GLW stock. But as a long-term buy-and-hold opportunity, Corning sets up as one of the most undervalued 5G stocks. Since its most recent earnings report, Oppenheimer (NYSE:OPY) reiterated its outperform rating for GLW stock and gave it a $42 price target, which would be a 24% increase from the stock’s price as of August 11, 2023.  Crown Castle (CCI) Image of Crown Castle (CCI) logo on a web browser highlighted through the lens of a magnifying glassSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comCrown Castle (NYSE:CCI) is a real estate investment trust that owns over 40,000 cell towers and 85,000 miles of fiber-optic cable. CCI stock is down over 42% in the last 12 months. But this looks like an overreaction to short-term circumstances.    One reason could be that investors are concerned over the company’s low margins. Building or acquiring a network of cell phone towers is a capital-intensive opportunity. And it makes sense that Crown Castle is sensitive to rising interest rates. The company’s 6% dividend is also less attractive with investors being able to collect a yield of nearly 5% from fixed-income investments.  Furthermore, the company is also facing the likelihood of lower revenue from T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) – its largest customer – as it consolidates its Sprint network. This has kept the company’s revenue and earnings flat to slightly higher on a YOY basis.  Nevertheless, as 5G penetration continues to expand, the company’s revenues will rise accordingly. And with a forward P/E ratio of just 14x earnings, CCI stock is one of the undervalued 5G stocks to watch over the next several years.  On the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Yahoo Finance's Anjalee khemlani is following the story and joins us now for more. Anje, the details, please.ANJAEE KHEMLANI: Absolutely, Jared. So we know, of course, that the World Health Organization has been tracking a number of variants. And here in the US, we're starting to see an uptick of one, that's EG5, nicknamed Araiza unofficially or Eris unofficially as well as the BA.2.86. That is another one that has caused some concern-- EG5 of concern because of the fact that it is a little bit more immune evasive.But that is all in the contributing to the story of these vaccine makers up on the news that there is something to be concerned about. We know that they have all demonstrated some efficacy against this new variants, even though they have been programmed and formulated to fight the Xb15. If you remember, that was the Omicron variant at the time.This new one EG5, all of these variants that we're seeing are part of that broader sub lineage, that Omicron family. So the expectation is that they should be effective come the fall when they do need those shots. Now it's important to note that the three vaccine players Moderna, Pfizer, and Novavax are yet to get approval from the FDA. They're still conducting their efficacy trials and should hear soon.There are some concerns that the rollout might not take place in September as planned, but there still is a timeline of waiting. So we have to wait and see how that all pans out. But as of right now, experts aren't warning that this is necessarily going to drive a surge the way that we've seen in the past during the pandemic, but definitely are seeing an uptick in cases attributable to these new variants. It's something to keep an eye on out for as the fall continues.JARED BLIKRE: So we know you will keep an eye on all of that for us. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani, thank you.]"

Though a favorable trend was observed in the study’s other primary endpoint of overall survival (“OS”), it did not reach statistical significance. The study investigators will test the OS endpoint at a subsequent analysis.The LITESPARK-005 study also achieved its secondary endpoint of statistically significant improvement in the objective response rate (“ORR”). No new safety signals were reported in the study, and the safety profile of Welireg was in line with observations in its previously conducted studies.Merck plans to present these results at a future medical meeting.An oral HIF-2α inhibitor, Welireg is currently approved in the United States and Europe to treat adult patients with von Hippel-Lindau (“VHL”) disease who require therapy for associated RCC, central nervous system hemangioblastomas, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors, not requiring immediate surgery.Merck’s shares have lost 1.6% year to date against the industry’s 7.8% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPer management, the LITESPARK-005 is the first late-stage study to show positive results in patients with advanced RCC who received a checkpoint inhibitor and a VEGF-TKI therapy. With a potential label expansion in advanced RCC, Merck aims to introduce Welireg as a new treatment option that can reduce the risk of disease progression or death for an indication with low survival rates.The LITESPARK-005 study is part of Merck's comprehensive late-stage development program on Welireg in RCC. The program consists of three other late-stage studies – LITESPARK-011, LITESPARK-012 and LITESPARK-022. While LITESPARK-011 and LITESPARK-012 evaluate Welireg in the second-line and treatment-naïve advanced disease settings, respectively, LITESPARK-022 evaluates Welireg in the adjuvant setting.Story continuesMerck’s oncology portfolio is highly dependent on Keytruda, its blockbuster anti-PD-1 therapy, which accounted for over 40% of the company’s revenues in second-quarter 2022. With concerns over Keytruda’s potential loss of exclusivity post-2028, a label expansion to drugs like Welireg will enable the company to narrow down its dependence on the anti-PD-1 therapy.Merck &amp; Co., Inc.

AARP joined in the battle, filing an amicus brief on behalf of HHS on Friday. J&amp;J and Bristol have asked for their lawsuits to be merged, and several have asked for summary judgement, which would avoid a drawn-out trial process.Various lists have been published in an attempt to guess which products CMS will target.UBS includes some common assumptions like Merck's diabetes drug Januvia, J&amp;J and Bayer's blood thinner Xarelto, Pfizer (PFE) and Bristol's blood thinner Eliquis, J&amp;J and AbbVie's (ABBV) cancer drug Imbruvica, and Pfizer and Astellas's Xtandi.Bottles and pills of Xarelto, marketed by Janssen Pharmaceutical, sit on a counter at a pharmacy in Provo, Utah, Jan. 9, 2020. (George Frey/REUTERS) (George Frey / reuters)Some of these are listed in the lawsuits brought on by the companies who anticipate being targeted.UBS has also included AstraZeneca's (AZN) Farxiga, Amgen's (AMGN) Enbrel, Astellas's Myrbetriq, and Boehringer Ingelheim's Spiriva, and its Jardiance with Eli Lilly (LLY).Story continuesThe companies will have until Oct. 1 to sign an agreement to begin negotiations with CMS. And in UBS's view, this process actually getting underway could take some pressure off the sector.""Although the beginning of IRA implementation is a watershed moment for the industry, we argue that the next 1-2 steps could see overhang removal for the Pharma sector in the near term,"" UBS said.The lawsuits cite either the First, Fifth, or Eighth Amendments, alleging the powers granted to Medicare by Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act are unconstitutional.""Given that IRA disallows 'administrative and judicial review' of how CMS determines negotiation-eligible drugs and maximum fair prices, lawsuits are challenging the implementation on constitutional grounds,"" UBS wrote.Some legal experts see this strategy as a likely path to the Supreme Court.UBS analysts echoed a similar sentiment, saying the lawsuits, filed in various district courts around the country, could help fast-track the suits to what they called a ""business-friendly"" Supreme Court.The lawsuits citing the First Amendment claim the companies believe their freedom of speech is being taken away as they are only given a negotiation window, but not a chance to opt out of the negotiations.The lawsuits citing the Fifth Amendment claim the lack of option qualifies as government seizure of their property, and the Eighth Amendment was cited for excessive fines — or the penalty that Medicare can levy for noncompliance.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

However, it faces headwinds from weak fertilizer prices.The company’s shares are down 28.6% over a year compared with a 32.8% decline recorded by its industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Let’s find out why this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is worth retaining at the moment. Strong Demand, Cost Actions Aid MOSMosaic is benefiting from strong demand for phosphate and potash. Higher agricultural commodity prices and attractive farm economics are driving demand for fertilizers globally. Farmer economics remains attractive in most global growing regions on strong crop demand, affordable inputs, and favorable weather.Demand for grains and oilseeds remains high along with strong farm economics. Strong agricultural commodity pricing trends and improved farmer affordability are likely to drive demand for fertilizers in the balance of 2023. Strong demand is expected to support the company’s sales volumes.Mosaic is also taking actions to reduce costs amid a still-challenging operating environment. Its actions to improve its operating cost structure through transformation plans are expected to boost profitability.The company also remains committed to carrying out investments with high returns with moderate capital expenditures, such as the expansion of MicroEssentials capacity at its Riverview facility, constructing a new blending and distribution center in Palmeirante, Brazil, executing the construction of a purified phosphoric acid plant for sale in North Americ, and installing a Hydrofloat flotation system at Esterhazy's K2 mill. The estimated total capital expenditures for 2023 are $1.3-$1.4 billion.Mosaic also aims to return substantial free cash flow in 2023 to shareholders. The company strives to maintain a healthy balance sheet.Weak Prices AilSofter potash and phosphate prices may impact the company’s margins. Prices of phosphate and potash retreated since the back half of 2022 from their peak levels attained in the first half riding on the impacts of the Russia-Ukraine war and disruptions due to the sanctions in Belarus. Lower selling prices hurt sales and margins across the company’s Phosphate and Potash segments in the second quarter of 2023. Despite some recovery of late, weaker year-over-year fertilizer prices are expected weigh on the company’s profitability.Story continues The Mosaic Company Price and Consensus The Mosaic Company Price and ConsensusThe Mosaic Company price-consensus-chart | The Mosaic Company Quote Stocks to ConsiderBetter-ranked stocks worth a look in the basic materials space include Carpenter Technology Corporation CRS, PPG Industries, Inc.

Qantas last placed a Dreamliner order in 2018, when it signed a deal for six jetliners meant to replace its remaining Boeing 747s.

This critical step represents a milestone toward the startup and eventual commercial operation of the second new unit at the Plant Vogtle facility. The journey toward reliable and emissions-free energy production has taken a significant leap forward with the initiation of fuel loading.Vogtle Unit 3 and the Dawn of a New EraBefore exploring the details of Vogtle Unit 4, it's essential to highlight the significance of Vogtle Unit 3 —the first newly-constructed nuclear unit in the United States in over three decades. Vogtle Unit 3 achieved a significant feat by entering commercial operation on Jul 31. This achievement not only provides customers in Georgia with a reliable source of emissions-free energy but also represents a triumph for innovation and progress in the energy sector.Vogtle Unit 4 Fuel Load and Regulatory ApprovalThe initiation of fuel loading for Vogtle Unit 4 follows a significant regulatory milestone. Southern Nuclear, the facility's operator, received the 103(g) finding from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in July. This finding symbolizes the NRC's affirmation that the new unit has been constructed according to the Combined License and NRC regulations. The safety and dependability of the unit's operation are guaranteed by conformance to these strict standards.Fuel Assembly Installation and Operational TestingA team of skilled nuclear technicians from Westinghouse, along with operators from Southern Nuclear, is scheduled to execute the safe installation of 157 fuel assemblies into the Unit 4 reactor core in the coming days. This intricate process requires meticulous attention to detail and technical proficiency to ensure seamless integration of these assemblies into the core.Looking Ahead: Startup Testing and BeyondFollowing the successful fuel load, the next phase involves startup testing, a critical step that demonstrates the synchronized operation of the primary coolant system and steam supply system. This testing is conducted under design temperature and pressure conditions, with the fuel assemblies now in place within the reactor. Operators will meticulously guide the plant from cold shutdown to initial criticality, synchronize the unit to the electric grid, and methodically increase power output to reach the coveted 100% mark.Story continuesProjected Timeline for Unit 4's Service DebutAs the journey toward Vogtle Unit 4's commissioning unfolds, projections indicate that the unit is set to be placed in service during the late fourth quarter of 2023 or the first quarter of 2024. This anticipated timeline underscores Georgia Power's dedication to delivering results while adhering to the highest standards of safety and operational excellence.Powering the Future: The Role of Vogtle UnitsGeorgia Power's unwavering commitment to clean, safe, reliable and affordable energy is epitomized by the new Vogtle units. These units are poised to play an instrumental role in delivering power to approximately 2.7 million customers. Once operational, each unit has the capacity to generate enough electricity to sustain around 500,000 homes and businesses. The operation of these units is a testament to Southern's stewardship, acting on behalf of co-owners of Georgia Power, Oglethorpe Power, MEAG Power and Dalton Utilities.ConclusionThe meticulous execution of fuel assembly installation, coupled with rigorous testing and operational procedures, paves the way for the unit's eventual integration into the grid. This milestone not only reflects Georgia Power's dedication to technological advancement but also marks a step forward in the pursuit of a greener and more energy-efficient future.Zacks Rank and Key PicksSO is an American utility firm that provides electricity to customers across Southern United States.

173,c1bb0e00-08ad-322e-aa50-4caf5862507d,NOC,2023-08-22,20 States with Most Guns Per Capita,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-states-most-guns-per-203058058.html,1692649858,STORY,"['RGR', 'NOC']","[In this article, we will be covering 20 States with most guns per capita. If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the guns and accessories market and market trends, you can go directly to 5 States with Most Guns Per Capita.In the US, gun ownership rates vary greatly from state to state. In some states more than 60% of adults own firearms, while in other states it's less than 15%. States with stricter gun control laws lean towards having lower levels of gun ownership as compared to the states with little or no state laws governing or restricting gun ownership. It is important to note that the majority of firearms in the US remain unregistered.The Global Guns and Accessories Market: An AnalysisIn one of our previous articles, we briefly discussed that the constitution of the US explicitly allows the population to own firearms. Naturally, this also means that a large number of people in America own guns. It comes as no surprise that America is the country with the highest number of guns per capita in the world. Therefore, the market in the US contributes greatly to the global guns and accessories market.According to Fortune Business Insights, the global guns and accessories market was valued at $6.14 billion in 2019. Looking forward, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 6.15% during 2020-2027, propelling the global guns and accessories market to reach as high as $9.33 billion by the end of the forecasted period. Stringent regulations by governments around the world with regards to gun ownership could hamper the growth of the market. However, growing terrorist activities, political unrest, and cross-border conflicts have contributed to the growing demand for guns and accessories in several countries. Increasing defense expenditures, military modernization programs, and procurement of advanced firearms around the world is expected to support market growth. Moreover, the demand for guns and accessories for the purposes of hunting, sports shooting, self-defense, and personal security concerns is on the rise and it is expected to further augment market growth. According to the report, the US accounted for more than 60% of the global market. Growing personal security concerns because of the increasing numbers of mass shootings in the country is expected to positively influence the market in North America. Additionally, the presence of key players such as Sturm, Ruger &amp; Company (NYSE:RGR), AMMO, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWW), and Smith &amp; Wesson Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWBI) and others boosts the region's market share.Story continuesOn July 15, Reuters reported that the US House of Representatives passed a defense bill to authorize record spending for the Department of Defense. The fiscal 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), setting policy for the Pentagon and authorizing $886 billion in spending, was approved by a vote of 219-210. The House measure includes $300 million in support to Ukraine as it deals with the invasion by Russia, and also initiatives to counter China. On July 14, Reuters had reported in another post that General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff had said that the US and its allies are required to speed up the delivery of weapons to Taiwan in the coming years to help the island defend itself. China has staged war games around the island and also declared no-fly and no-sail zones in an attempt to cut Taiwan off in a war. The post also mentions that Taiwan has been complaining of delays with regards to US weapon deliveries, as manufacturers turned supplies to Ukraine since the invasion by Russia began.Owing to the expected rise in defense spending, political unrest, and intensifying border conflicts in Asia as well as the war in Ukraine is expected to positively influence the market and provide defense contractors like Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) with business opportunities. Here are some comments from Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) Q2 2023 earnings call:“Turning to the budget environment and starting with the U.S. We're encouraged by the continued bipartisan support for national security funding to implement the administration's national defense strategy. The FY ‘24 budget and recent congressional committee bill prioritize modernization including areas of strength in our portfolio, such as the triad, the space domain, information superiority, and advanced weapons. We also anticipate continued support for Ukraine and related emergency spending, which would represent even further increased demand.Global demand for our products also continues to grow as our allies increase defense spending to address evolving threats. We are well positioned in multiple markets to meet this demand with programs such as [Argonne] IBCS and E2-D as well as munitions. With a robust backlog and leading growth outlook.”On July 27, Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) reported strong earnings for the fiscal second quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $5.34, surpassing EPS estimates by $0.02. The company reported a revenue of $9.58 billion and outperformed revenue estimates by $234.97 million.The increase in gun violence and mass shootings in the US is expected to result in increasing gun purchases from civilians for personal safety, further fueling the market. On July 23, Forbes reported that the number of mass shootings in the US this year has already reached above 400 to surpass the number of shootings at this point last year and setting 2023 up to be the deadliest year in at least a decade. The post mentions that according to the Gun Violence Archive, as many as 453 people have been killed in mass shootings so far this year. The increasing demand for guns means that business is booming for some of the top players in this space, such as Sturm, Ruger &amp; Company (NYSE:RGR), AMMO, Inc. (NASDAQ:POWW), and Smith &amp; Wesson Brands, Inc. (NASDAQ:SWBI). Let's now take a look at 20 states with most guns per capita and the firearm mortality rate in each of these states.20 States with Most Guns Per CapitaPixabay/Public DomainMethodologyIn this article, we have listed the top 20 states with most guns per capita. While most of the firearms in the US go unregistered, we have tried our best to find the right opportunity to learn about this world. To collect data for our list, we used a published research report by RAND Corporation on state-level estimates of household firearm ownership as of 2016, which is a useful measure of gun ownership in a population. We have ranked the top 20 states with most guns per capita below in ascending order on the basis of the proportion of adults who live in a household with a firearm.Moreover, we also used data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which is a government agency, on firearm mortality by state. We used data obtained for the latest year in their dataset, which is 2021, with regards to the number of deaths caused by firearms. The two standards of measurement that we have chosen for this article should allow the readers to test their theories about the relationship between firearms ownership and deaths caused by firearms in each of the top 20 states with most guns per capita.20 States with Most Guns Per Capita20.

Work related to the deal is scheduled to be over by Nov 30, 2026.Details of the DealValued at $117 million, the contract was offered by the Army Contracting Command, Redstone Arsenal, AL. Per the terms of the deal, Javelin JV will procure lightweight command launch units for Javelin missiles.Work related to this deal will be carried out in Tucson, AZ.Importance of JavelinJavelin is the world's first one-man-portable, fire-and-forget, multipurpose missile system. This compact and lightweight missile enhances direct-fire capability against armored vehicles, buildings and field fortifications.This combat-proven weapon system boasts a reliability rate of more than 94%. It can be deployed from multiple platforms and used in all weather, day or night operations. The system’s Command Launch Unit performs surveillance, allowing a gunner to see targets.The fact that Javelin has been used in Afghanistan and Iraq in more than 5,000 engagements surely reflects the solid demand that it enjoys in the missile market. The latest contract win by RTX is a bright example of that and such contract wins tend to boost the company’s revenue growth in the coming quarters.What’s Ahead?Increasing geopolitical tensions worldwide have prompted nations to strengthen their defense systems manifold. With rapid technological upgrades, missile defense has steadily become pivotal in a nation’s defense strategy. With the United States being the world’s largest weapon supplier and RTX being a prominent U.S. missile maker, the increased missile defense adoption by nations provides the company with solid growth opportunities.Looking ahead, per a report by the Research and Markets firm, the global rocket and missile market is projected to witness a CAGR of 4.5% during the 2022-2030 period to reach $84.2 million by 2030.Story continuesSuch massive growth projections indicate solid opportunities for RTX, which has a handful of combat proven missiles in its product portfolio, like Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air Missile (AMRAAM), Guidance Enhanced Missile (GEM-T), the National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System (NASAMS), Tomahawk, Standard Missile 2 (SM-2) and a few more, in addition to the Javelin missile.Peer ProspectsConsidering the solid growth opportunities offered by the global rocket and missile market, other major defense primes like Northrop Grumman NOC, Lockheed LMT and Boeing BA that specialize in developing technologically advanced missiles should also benefit.Northrop Grumman’s missile defense program includes AGM-88E advanced anti-radiation guided missiles, the Ground Based Strategic Deterrent weapon system and rocket propulsion systems. In August 2022, the company had been chosen by the U.S. Missile Defense Agency to lead the Homeland Missile Defense Program.NOC boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 4.1%.

The stock has a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.5%.For almost 25 years, Boeing-built and supported air and missile defense systems have been protecting the nation, warfighters, allies and international partners against threats ranging from intercontinental ballistic missiles to hostile aircraft.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, includingApple Inc., NVIDIA Corp. and Bank of America Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Apple shares have struggled lately, with the stock losing losing -11.6% of its value since the start of August, lagging the Zacks Tech sector's -7.3% decline and the S&amp;P 500 index's -4.6% pullback. This recent weakness notwithstanding, the stock has been a standout performer this year, handily outperforming the Tech sector as well as the broader market.The company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade, as well as the launch of its high-yield savings account with Apple Card, helped in driving subscriber growth.Apple's results also benefited from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption among enterprises. Apple expects iPhone and Services' year-over-year growth to accelerate in fiscal fourth-quarter as compared with the June quarter.However, revenues for both Mac and iPad are expected to decline by double digits on a year-over-year basis due to difficult comparison.

That said, Nvidia's performance this year is one for the record books, with the stock up +192.9% this year vs. +32.7% for the Tech sector and +15.2% for the market.Story continuesNvidia has literally been in a league of its own since its last quarterly release on May 24th when it raised guidance by a magnitude that we have never seen from another company. With the company on deck to report results on Wednesday, August 23rd, it is under the spotlight as to whether the preceding quarter's numbers were a one-off or the start of a sustained period of outperformance.The company is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute &amp; Networking revenues.A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.However, NVDA's near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and professional visualization end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and professional visualization chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Bank of America have underperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (-10.9% vs. -15.9%). The tough economic backdrop is expected to keep weighing on investment banking (IB) business. This, along with the volatile nature of the capital markets, might hurt non-interest income.

We will also discuss the emerging trends and key players in the extended reality industry. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Biggest Augmented Reality And VR Companies In The World.Extended reality is an umbrella term encompassing all immersive technologies, including augmented, virtual, and mixed reality. Immersive technologies combine or replace our physical reality with a virtual one. In augmented reality, the user experiences virtual information intermingled with the real world. Instead of being isolated from the physical world, the user experiences the interplay of virtual elements like images, animations, and information with their actual surroundings. Snapchat by Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) and Pokémon Go by Niantic are some of the most well-known examples of augmented reality. On March 23, Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) launched a separate division for businesses, AR Enterprise Services (ARES), that facilitates them to build AR features for their websites and apps. As of March, almost 250 million people interact with AR on Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) daily, posing a good opportunity for enterprises to correspond with their customers. The first product by ARES is Shopping Suite, which lets consumers virtually try different products and find their right fit before buying. Businesses can optimize and manage their augmented reality assets and integrations and measure performance analytics using this feature. Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) is one of the leading names in bringing AR to the mainstream.  In virtual reality, the user is fully immersed in the digitally created environment. The user feels transported into an alternate reality completely disconnected from the real one. Virtual reality requires the user to put on a VR headset, whereas augmented reality can be accessed using a screen like a mobile or tablet. Mixed reality merges the physical and virtual worlds.  Story continuesThe Extended Reality Industry OutlookExtended reality technology has found numerous applications in our everyday life. It can be used in entertainment, education, training, estate tours, and many other areas. In healthcare, it is used to train medical professionals in simulation. It helps them visualize the patient's organs prior to surgery and target organs better. The surgeons then operate, greatly reducing the risks involved. According to a report by Knowledge Sourcing Intelligence LLP, the extended reality market was valued at $11.514 billion in 2021 and has been estimated to reach $95.438 billion by 2028, growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 35.27% through the forecasted period.The popularity of extended reality is constantly rising; however, the growth has been relatively slow. The two main factors for this slow growth include privacy concerns as well as the high cost of production. The VR headset needs to be compact but efficient, thus increasing the production cost. The high cost implies fewer people could afford it, and sales would be low. Thus developments and advancements in the hardware segment would catalyze the market growth for extended reality. Furthermore, to create a truly immersive experience large amounts of information from the user's environment is collected. This extensive flux of information creates a privacy concern. North America currently has the biggest share in the global extended reality market. The main reason for this large claim is the presence of most of the key players in this region. Companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) are all present in this region. However, the Asia Pacific region is expected to grow rapidly in the future. The rapid boost in technology development, 5G, and the use of smartphones would be the main contributors to this growth. The pandemic also catalyzed the popularity of extended reality products as the shift towards remote work caused a surge in demand. The gaming industry especially poses a great opportunity for the growth of extended reality technology in this region. According to a report by Technavio, the Asia Pacific region is estimated to contribute 37% to the growth of the global extended reality market from 2023 through 2027. On June 1, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) announced that the company will soon launch the next generation of its mixed-reality headset, the Meta Quest 3. The new generation would be 40% thinner and have enhanced graphics performance than the previous product. The device will be launched in a few months, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has promised to give more details at the company's annual AR/VR conference on September 27. VR headsets are currently used predominantly in gaming. However, companies like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) have been trying to market it as a productivity and fitness tool. On June 5, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced their extended reality headset, Vision Pro. The Vision Pro starts at $3,499 which is almost three times the price of Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) headset. The Vision Pro uses a new chip, R1, that claims to process information from its sensors faster than the blink of an eye. The headset has a transparent display allowing the user to still see their environment while interacting with virtual elements. The users can select options by just blinking or tapping their fingers together. On June 5, Erik Woodring, equity research executive director at Morgan Stanley, in a CNBC interview talked about the future of the product and gave valuable insight into how the extended reality market would grow with time. Here are some comments from his interview:""I did partially (use the word consumer as opposed to enterprise) because I think the early use cases are going to be more on the consumer side; that's not to say we're excluding the enterprise market at all. There are use cases that exist today in AR and VR and that will exist in the future with AR VR in the enterprise, but think of Apple as largely a consumer brand getting into the enterprise. I think of the same way when it comes to mixed reality headsets, the consumer is the primary customer today, the enterprise will be a customer tomorrow, but the opportunity today is bigger for the consumer.""In addition to Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), some other big tech names that are making hefty investments in AR and VR include Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).20 Biggest Augmented Reality And VR Companies In The WorldBairachnyi Dmitry/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology To make our list of the 20 biggest augmented reality and VR companies in the world, we sifted through various AR/VR ETFs and identified their top holdings.

The company came up with an impressive performance in second-quarter fiscal 2023.The company reported second-quarter 2023 earnings per share (EPS) of $1.60, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 7.4%. The bottom line declined 9.6% year over year. Non-GAAP revenues of $496.6 million surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.1%. The top line increased 4% (up 5% at constant currency or cc) from the year-ago quarter.The company’s performance is being driven by continued strength in the aerospace and defense sector owing to government-led programs and digital transformation bodes well. Also, it is likely to benefit from rapid growth in the high-tech industry, led by ongoing development in artificial intelligence and machine learning.The company continues to launch new products to tap the rapid adoption of Internet of Things in the manufacturing industry. In June, the company expanded the capabilities of its Ansys Discovery platform by incorporating high-frequency electromagnetics modeling for antennas. This development allows engineering teams to conduct virtual exploration of multiple design areas simultaneously, minimizing the need for costly physical prototyping and testing.Aggressive acquisition strategy has played a pivotal part in developing the company’s business in the last few years. In June 2023, management acquired Diakopto, a provider of Electronic Design Automation solutions for integrated circuit development. The acquisition is expected to enable design engineers to ""shift left,"" detecting interconnect parasitic problems early in the design cycle and minimizing costly iterations in the design cycle.Story continuesANSYS’ 2023 and 2024 revenues are anticipated to rise 10.6% and 9.2% year over year, respectively.

The long-term EPS growth rate stands at 8.1%.On the flip side, geopolitical instability, forex volatility and weakness in global macroeconomic conditions are likely to affect ANSYS’ performance as clients cut back on expenditure.

It has recently witnessed a surge of 1.87%, juxtaposed with a three-month change of 9.38%. However, fresh insights from the GuruFocus Score Rating hint at potential headwinds. Notably, its diminished rankings in financial strength, growth, and valuation suggest that the company might not live up to its historical performance. Join us as we dive deep into these pivotal metrics to unravel the evolving narrative of VF Corp.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with VFC. Click here to check it out. VFC 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VFCVF Corp's Rocky Road Ahead: Unraveling the Factors Limiting GrowthWhat Is the GF Score?The GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 5/102. Profitability rank: 6/103. Growth rank: 0/104. GF Value rank: 4/105. Momentum rank: 4/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned VF Corp the GF Score of 61 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Understanding VF Corp BusinessVF Corp, with a market cap of $7.93 billion, designs, produces, and distributes branded apparel, footwear, and accessories. Its portfolio includes renowned brands like Vans, The North Face, Timberland, Supreme, and Dickies. VF Corp markets its products in the Americas, Europe, and Asia-Pacific through wholesale sales to retailers, e-commerce, and branded stores owned by the company and partners. The company, which traces its roots to 1899, has grown through multiple acquisitions.Story continuesVF Corp's Rocky Road Ahead: Unraveling the Factors Limiting GrowthFinancial Strength BreakdownVF Corp's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's Altman Z-Score is just 1.4, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.1 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels.The company's debt-to-equity ratio is 2.9, which is worse than 94.93% of 888 companies in the Manufacturing - Apparel &amp; Accessories industry. A high debt-to-equity ratio suggests over-reliance on borrowing and vulnerability to market fluctuations. Additionally, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 15.63, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 92.12% of 761 companies in the Manufacturing - Apparel &amp; Accessories industry. Tillinghast said in his book Big Money Think's Small: Biases, Blind Spots, and Smarter Investing that a high debt-to-Ebitda ratio can be a red flag unless tangible assets cover the debt.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where VF Corp seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. Lastly, VF Corp predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.VF Corp's Rocky Road Ahead: Unraveling the Factors Limiting GrowthNext StepsGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. It's crucial for investors to consider these factors when making investment decisions.

Traditionally, many investors group companies with a market cap of between $2 billion and $10 billion into the mid-cap range.Mid-cap stocks can lead to more favorable returns for investors because they fall into a sweet spot. They are small enough to have dramatic upside potential. However, unlike small-caps, they tend to already be well-established and have proven their abilities to generate consistent profits and cash flow.What sorts of mid-cap stocks are the most compelling today? These are three to buy for August 2023.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsZions Bancorporation (ZION)Image of a grey cityscape with a large corporate building that features the word bank on itSource: ShutterstockZions Bancorporation (NASDAQ:ZION) is a unique commercial-focused bank operating primarily in Rocky Mountain states such as Utah. Headquartered in Salt Lake City, it operates as a commercial bank, providing services to small- and mid-sized businesses. These business owners, in turn, tend to maintain non-interest-bearing accounts at Zions branches as part of their customer relationship, which gives them access to loans and lines of credit.ZION stock collapsed earlier this year as traders feared that these deposits would flee the bank. In theory, with all the attention on rising interest rates, depositors could have moved their funds to high-yield savings accounts at rival banks.However, this hasn’t happened. In fact, as of June 30, 2023, Zions’ total deposits increased $5.1 billion, or 7%, from March 31, 2023, due to increases from both brokered and customer deposits. It turns out that Zions’ long-term relationship banking creates customer loyalty and holds up during an economic shock.ZION stock has bounced from a 52-week low of $18 to $38 now as analysts appreciate Zions’ stability amid the current regional banking storm. That said, shares traded as high as $60 last year; there’s plenty of upside left as things normalize. Shares go for just eight times forward earnings and offer a 4.3% dividend yield today.Story continuesGrupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte (OMAB)a close-up shot of an airplane engineSource: frank_peters / Shutterstock.comGrupo Aeroportuario del Centro Norte (NASDAQ:OMAB) is a Mexican airport operator. It runs 13 airports primarily in northern Mexico; its crown jewel is in the large industrial city of Monterrey and other notable holdings include Acapulco, Ciudad Juarez and Reynosa.Monterrey has been a key hub for the reshoring movement. Following the pandemic, many companies have moved production away from China and toward other markets, with Mexico being a major beneficiary. Thanks to cheap labor, shared cultural ties, easy transportation options and a new free trade agreement, Mexico and the United States are natural economic allies.In fact, Mexico surpassed China in total trade volumes with the U.S. earlier this year. It’s even gotten to the point that even many Chinese companies are now relocating production to Mexico to avoid getting locked out of the U.S. market altogether.This is fantastic news for Centro Norte. Its flagship airport in Monterrey is enjoying a traffic boom as new factories from the likes of Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Hershey (NYSE:HSY) open in that city. All this leads to more airplane flights and more profits. OMAB stock sells for less than 15 times forward earnings. That’s a bargain price for a firm that has grown earnings more than 12%/year compounded throughout the past decade.National Storage Affiliates (NSA)Real estate agent handing over a house key, desktop with tools, wood swatches and computer on background, top view. Real estate stocks.Source: Stock-Asso / ShutterstockNational Storage Affiliates (NYSE:NSA) is a real estate investment trust focused on self-storage units.The industry in general, and National Storage in particular, has grown rapidly in recent years. For its part, NSA was founded in 2013 and has already grown to generating more than $800 million in annual revenues today. This comes both from rising demand overall and NSA’s aggressive mergers and acquisition strategy.However, the run-up in NSA stock has been interrupted. In fact, shares are down by roughly half since their 2021 peak. This comes primarily due to the surge in interest rates. Investors tend to sell off high yield stocks when interest rates on risk-free alternatives such as government bonds increase. In addition, National Storage has to pay more interest on its debt due to higher rates.These are real headwinds to National Storage’s near-term valuation. That said, the selling is way overdone.

Masks created with photos from social media that can penetrate a system protected by face ID. They sound like the stuff of science fiction, but these techniques are already available to criminals preying on everyday consumers.Most Read from BloombergCitadel Vets 69,000 Intern Applicants to Find Next Math GeniusesPutin Agrees to Visit China in First Trip Since Arrest WarrantWhat to Do With a 45-Story Skyscraper and No TenantsS&amp;P 500 Climbs 1% as Traders Dial Back Fed Wagers: Markets WrapUS Court Paves Way for Spot Bitcoin ETF in Grayscale RulingThe proliferation of scam tech has alarmed regulators, police and people at the highest levels of the financial industry. Artificial intelligence in particular is being used to “turbocharge” fraud, US Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan warned in June, calling for increased vigilance from law enforcement.Even before AI broke loose and became available to anyone with an internet connection, the world was struggling to contain an explosion in financial fraud. In the US alone, consumers lost almost $8.8 billion last year, up 44% from 2021, despite record investment in detection and prevention. Financial crime experts at major banks, including Wells Fargo &amp; Co. and Deutsche Bank AG, say the fraud boom on the horizon is one of the biggest threats facing their industry. On top of paying the cost of fighting scams, the financial industry risks losing the faith of burned customers. “It’s an arms race,” says James Roberts, who heads up fraud management at Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the country’s biggest bank. “It would be a stretch to say that we’re winning.”The history of scams is surely as old as the history of trade and business. One of the earliest known cases, more than 2,000 years ago, involved a Greek sea merchant who tried to sink his ship to get a fraudulent payout on an insurance policy. Look back through any newspaper archive and you’ll find countless attempts to part the gullible from their money. But the dark economy of fraud—just like the broader economy—has periodic bursts of destabilizing innovation. New tech lowers the cost of running a scam and lets the criminal reach a bigger pool of unprepared marks. Email introduced every computer user in the world to a cast of hard-up princes who needed help rescuing their lost fortunes. Crypto brought with it a blossoming of Ponzi schemes spread virally over social media.Story continuesThe AI explosion offers not only new tools but also the potential for life-changing financial loss. And the increased sophistication and novelty of the technology mean that everyone, not just the credulous, is a potential victim. Covid-19 lockdowns ­accelerated the adoption of online banking around the world, with phones and laptops replacing face-to-face interactions at bank branches. It’s brought advantages in lower costs and increased speed for financial firms and their customers, as well as openings for scammers.Some of the new techniques go beyond what current off-the-shelf technology can do, and it’s not always easy to tell when you’re dealing with a garden-variety fraudster or a nation-state actor. “We are starting to see much more sophistication with respect to cybercrime,” says Amy Hogan-Burney, general manager of cybersecurity policy and protection at Microsoft Corp.Globally, cybercrime costs, including scams, are set to hit $8 trillion this year, outstripping the economic output of Japan, the world’s third-largest economy. By 2025 it will reach $10.5 trillion, after more than tripling in a decade, according to researcher ­Cybersecurity Ventures.In the Sydney suburb of Redfern, some of Roberts’ team of more than 500 spend their days eavesdropping on cons to hear firsthand how AI is reshaping their battle. A fake request for money from a loved one isn’t new. But now parents get calls that clone their child’s voice with AI to sound indistinguishable from the real thing. These tricks, known as social engineering scams, tend to have the highest hit rates and generate some of the quickest returns for fraudsters.Cloning a person’s voice is increasingly easy. Once a scammer downloads a short sample from an audio clip from someone’s social media or voicemail message—it can be as short as 30 seconds—they can use AI voice-synthesizing tools readily available online to create the content they need.Public social media accounts make it easy to figure out who a person’s relatives and friends are, not to mention where they live and work and other vital information. Bank bosses stress that scammers, running their operations like businesses, are prepared to be patient, sometimes planning attacks for months.What fraud teams are seeing so far is only a taste of what AI will make possible, according to Rob Pope, director of New ­Zealand’s government cybersecurity agency CERT NZ. He points out that AI simultaneously helps criminals increase the volume and customization of attacks. “It’s a fair bet that over the next two or three years we’re going to see more AI-generated criminal attacks,” says Pope, a former deputy commissioner in the New Zealand Police who oversaw some of the nation’s highest-profile criminal cases. “What AI does is accelerate the levels of sophistication and the ability of these bad people to pivot very quickly. AI makes it easier for them.”Listen to The Big Take podcast episode on AI scams on iHeart, Apple and Spotify.To give a sense of the challenge facing banks, Roberts says right now Commonwealth Bank of Australia is tracking about 85 million events a day through a network of surveillance tools. That’s in a country with a population of just 26 million.The industry hopes to fight back by educating consumers about the risks and increasing investment in defensive technology. New software lets CBA spot when customers use their computer mouse in an unusual way during a transaction—a red flag for a possible scam. Anything suspicious, including the destination of an order and how the purchase is processed, can alert staff in as few as 30 milli­seconds, allowing them to block the transaction.At Deutsche Bank, computer engineers have recently rebuilt their client activity monitoring system, called Black Forest, according to Thomas Graf, according to Thomas Graf, a senior machine learning engineer there. The tool looks at transaction criteria such as volume, currency and destination and automatically learns from reams of data which patterns suggest fraud. The model can be used on both retail and corporate transactions and has already unearthed several cases, including one involving organized crime, money laundering and tax evasion.Wells Fargo has overhauled tech systems to counter the risk of AI-generated videos and voices. “We train our software and our employees to be able to spot these fakes,” says Chintan Mehta, Wells Fargo’s head of digital technology. But the system needs to keep evolving to keep up with the criminals. Detecting scams, of course, costs money.One problem for companies: Every time they tighten things, criminals try to find a workaround. For example, some US banks require customers to upload a photo of an ID document when signing up for an account. Scammers are now buying stolen data on the dark web, finding photos of their victims from social media, and 3D-printing masks to create fake IDs with the stolen ­information. “And these can look like everything from what you get at a Halloween shop to an extremely lifelike silicone mask of Hollywood standards,” says Alain Meier, head of identity at Plaid Inc., which helps banks, financial technology companies and other businesses battle fraud with its ID verification software. Plaid analyzes skin texture and translucency to make sure the person in the photo looks real.Meier, who’s dedicated his career to detecting fraud, says the best fraudsters, those running their schemes as a business, build scamming software and package it up to sell on the dark web. Prices can range from $20 to thousands of dollars. “For example, it could be a Chrome extension to help you bypass finger­printing, or tools that can help you generate synthetic images,” he says.As fraud gets more sophisticated, the question of who’s responsible for losses is getting more contentious. In the UK, for example, victims of unknown transactions—say, someone copies and uses your credit card—are legally protected against losses. If someone tricks you into making a payment, responsibility is less clear. In July the nation’s top court ruled that a couple who were fooled into sending money abroad couldn’t hold their bank liable simply for following their instructions. But legislators and regulators have leeway to set other rules: The government is preparing to require banks to reimburse fraud victims when the cash is transferred via Faster Payments, a system for sending money between UK banks. Politicians and consumer advocates in other countries are pushing for similar changes, arguing that it’s unreasonable to expect people to recognize these increasingly ­sophisticated scams.Banks worry that changing the rules would simply make things easier for fraudsters. Financial industry leaders around the world are also trying to push a share of the responsibility onto tech firms. The fastest-growing scam category is investment fraud, often introduced to victims through search engines where scammers can easily buy sponsored advertising spots. When would-be investors click through, they often find realistic prospectuses and other financial data. Once they transfer their money, it can take months, if not years, to realize they’ve been swindled when they try to cash in on their “investment.”In June, a group of 30 lenders in the UK sent a letter to Prime Minister Rishi Sunak asking that tech companies contribute to refunds for victims of fraud stemming from their platforms. The government says it’s planning new legislation and other measures to crack down on online financial scams.The banking industry is lobbying to spread the responsibility more widely in part because costs appear to be going up. Once again, a familiar problem from economics applies in the scam economy, too. Like pollution from a factory, new technology is creating an externality, or a cost imposed on others. In this case it’s a heightened reach and risk for scams. Neither banks nor consumers want to be the only ones forced to pay the price.Chris Sheehan spent almost three decades with the country’s police force before joining National Australia Bank Ltd., where he heads investigations and fraud. He’s added about 40 people to his team in the past year with constant investment by the bank. When he adds up all the staff and tech costs, “it scares me how big the number is,” he says.“I am hopeful, because there are technological solutions, but you never completely solve the problem,” he says. It reminds him of his time fighting drug gangs as a cop. Framing it as a war on drugs was “a big mistake,” he says. “I will never phrase it in that ­framework—of a war on scams—because the implication is a war is winnable,” he says. “This is not winnable.”(Corrects description of Deutsche Bank's Black Forest system in the 14th paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekNigeria’s Train to Nowhere Shows How Not to Build Public TransitThe Next Wave of Scams Will Be Deepfake Video Calls From Your BossStock Pickers Never Had a Chance Against Hard Math of the MarketLuxury Villas Rise in Palestinian Boomtown Built on Shaky PeaceLyme Disease Has Exploded, and a New Vaccine Is (Almost) Here©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

""While Wells Fargo's history provides some context for the allegedly misleading statements, it is not sufficient to confer [intent to defraud].""Lawyers for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment. Wells Fargo did not immediately respond to similar requests.The plaintiffs had claimed that San Francisco-based Wells Fargo inflated its stock price through nine public statements discussing its ""diverse slates"" guidelines.Adopted in 2020, the policy called for at least 50% of candidates interviewed for jobs paying at least $100,000 to be minorities, women or people in other disadvantaged groups.Wells Fargo's share price fell 10.2% over two days in June 2022, wiping out more than $17 billion of market value, after the New York Times said federal prosecutors in Manhattan had begun a criminal probe into the sham interviews.

With 75% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Wells Fargo. Check out our latest analysis for Wells Fargo ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Wells Fargo?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Wells Fargo. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Wells Fargo's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Wells Fargo. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.3% and 4.2% of the stock.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 25 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Wells FargoThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Wells Fargo &amp; Company in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$113m worth of shares (at current prices). In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 25% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

The Food and Drug Administration cleared Pfizer's maternal vaccination to guard against a severe case of RSV when babies are most vulnerable — from birth through 6 months of age.The next step: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention must issue recommendations for using the vaccine, named Abrysvo, during pregnancy. (Vaccinations for older adults, also at high risk, are getting underway this fall using the same Pfizer shot plus another from competitor GSK.)“Maternal vaccination is an incredible way to protect the infants,” said Dr. Elizabeth Schlaudecker of Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, a researcher in Pfizer’s international study of the vaccine. If shots begin soon, “I do think we could see an impact for this RSV season.”RSV is a coldlike nuisance for most healthy people but it can be life-threatening for the very young. It inflames babies’ tiny airways so it’s hard to breathe or causes pneumonia. In the U.S. alone, between 58,000 and 80,000 children younger than 5 are hospitalized each year, and several hundred die, from the respiratory syncytial virus.Last year’s RSV season was extremely harsh in the U.S., and it began sickening tots in the summer, far earlier than usual.Babies are born with an immature immune system, dependent for their first few months on protection from mom. How the RSV vaccination will work: A single injection late in pregnancy gives enough time for the mom-to-be to develop virus-fighting antibodies that pass through the placenta to the fetus — ready to work at birth.It’s the same way pregnant women pass along protection against other infections. Pregnant women have long been urged to get a flu shot and a whooping cough vaccine — and more recently, COVID-19 vaccination.Story continuesPfizer's study included nearly 7,400 pregnant women plus their babies. Maternal vaccination didn’t prevent mild RSV infection — but it proved 82% effective at preventing a severe case during babies’ first three months of life. At age 6 months, it still was proving 69% effective against severe illness.Vaccine reactions were mostly injection-site pain and fatigue. In the study, there was a slight difference in premature birth — just a few weeks early — between vaccinated moms and those given a dummy shot, something Pfizer has said was due to chance. The FDA said to avoid the possibility, the vaccine should be given only between 32 weeks and 36 weeks of pregnancy, a few weeks later than during the clinical trial.If enough pregnant women get vaccinated, Pfizer has predicted the U.S. could prevent as many as 20,000 infant hospitalizations a year and 320,000 doctor visits.The only other option to guard babies from RSV: Giving them lab-made antibodies. The FDA recently approved a new drug that’s the first one-dose version, recommended for all infants younger than 8 months before their first RSV season starts. Beyfortus, from Sanofi and AstraZeneca, is expected to be available this fall.Cincinnati’s Schlaudecker, a pediatric infectious disease specialist, said both the new antibody drug and the maternal vaccine are eagerly anticipated, and predicted doctors will try a combination to provide the best protection for babies depending on their age and risk during RSV season.Another Cincinnati Children’s physician who's cared for seriously ill RSV patients volunteered to participate in Pfizer’s vaccine study when she became pregnant.“The last thing a parent wants to see is their kid struggling to breathe,” Dr. Maria Deza Leon said. “I was also at risk of being the person that could get RSV and give it to my son without even realizing.”Deza Leon received her shot in late January 2022 and her son Joaquin was born the following month. While she hasn’t yet learned if she received the vaccine or a dummy shot, Joaquin now is a healthy toddler who’s never been diagnosed with RSV.___The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

An estimated 58,000 to 80,000 children below the age of five years are hospitalized every year due to RSV infection in the U.S., according to government data.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention still needs to sign off on use of the vaccine, making it the first ever maternal shot against RSV widely available in the United States. That is expected to come shortly after Monday's approval announcement.The FDA’s decision was based on data from a late-stage trial with more than 7,000 participants showing the vaccine to be 82% effective in preventing severe infections in infants when given to expecting mothers in the second half of their pregnancy.Pfizer said the most common side effects in pregnant women were fatigue, headache, pain at the injection site, muscle pain, nausea, joint pain, and diarrhea.Story continuesSome experts raised concerns during an advisory committee meeting over the higher number of pre-term births among those who received the vaccine in the clinical trial compared with pregnant women in the placebo group.Sanofi and partner AstraZeneca in July received U.S. approval of their antibody therapy, nirsevimab, to prevent lower respiratory tract disease in infants and toddlers.In May, the FDA also gave the green light to GSK's RSV vaccines for older adults, helping it and Pfizer seal their presence in a multibillion-dollar market.GSK is not seeking approval for its shot in expectant mothers.

ABRYSVO is unadjuvanted and composed of two preF proteins selected to optimize protection against RSV A and B strains and was observed to be safe and effective.""ABRYSVO’s approval as the first and only maternal immunization to help protect newborns immediately at birth through six months from RSV marks a significant milestone for the scientific community and for public health,"" said Annaliesa Anderson, Ph.D., Senior Vice President and Chief Scientific Officer, Vaccine Research and Development, Pfizer. ""We are incredibly grateful to the clinical trial participants and study investigator teams around the world, as well as our Pfizer colleagues, for their commitment to making this vaccine available. Today, a long-sought-after goal to deliver a maternal vaccine that will help protect infants six months of age or younger – when they are at greatest risk of possible serious consequences from RSV – has been achieved.""The FDA’s decision is based on the data from the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial (NCT04424316) MATISSE (MATernal Immunization Study for Safety and Efficacy), a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the vaccine against LRTD and severe LRTD due to RSV in infants born to healthy individuals vaccinated during pregnancy. These results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in April 2023.Story continues""Newborns and young infants – whose immune systems are still developing and are not yet strong enough to defend against infections – may now be protected from RSV from the moment of birth through maternal immunization,"" said Eric A.F. Simões, M.D., Clinical Professor, Pediatrics-Infectious Diseases, University of Colorado School of Medicine and Children’s Hospital Colorado, Aurora. ""The approval of Pfizer’s ABRYSVO is a major triumph as it helps ensure no delay in potential RSV protection during an infant’s most vulnerable first six months of life and offers healthcare providers a new opportunity to help prevent severe RSV.""RSV is a contagious virus and a common cause of respiratory illness worldwide.1 The virus can affect the lungs and breathing passages of an infected individual, potentially causing severe illness or death.2,3,4 The disease burden of RSV in young children is staggering with virtually all children getting an RSV infection by the time they are two years old.5 In the United States, approximately 500,000 to 600,000 infants experience LRTD due to RSV each year and it is a leading cause of hospitalization in children less than one year of age. 6,7About ABRYSVOOn March 2, 2022, Pfizer announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation for ABRYSVO for prevention of RSV-associated lower respiratory tract illness in infants from birth up to six months of age by active immunization of pregnant women. This decision was followed by the FDA’s acceptance of ABRYSVO’s Biologics License Application (BLA) under priority review for infants in February 2023.Pfizer currently is the only company with an RSV vaccine to help protect older adults, as well as help protect infants through maternal immunization. In May 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved RSVpreF under the name ABRYSVO for the prevention of LRTD caused by RSV in individuals 60 years of age or older. The approval was followed in June by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) official recommendation for the vaccine for use in adults 60 years of age and older.In July 2023, Pfizer announced that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive opinion to recommend the granting of a marketing authorization for the RSV vaccine candidate, PF-06928316 or RSVpreF, to help protect older adults and infants through maternal immunization from RSV. The CHMP’s positive opinion is being reviewed for each indication by the European Commission (EC). The EC will decide whether to approve RSVpreF, whose European Union (EU) trade name will be ABRYSVO.In February 2023, Pfizer Japan announced an application was filed with the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare for RSVPreF as a maternal immunization to help protect infants against RSV. In April 2023, Pfizer Canada announced Health Canada accepted RSVpreF for review for both individuals ages 60 and older and as a maternal immunization to help protect infants against RSV.Pfizer has initiated two additional clinical trials evaluating ABRYSVO. One trial is being conducted in children at higher risk for RSV disease ages 2-&lt;18.8 A second trial is evaluating adults ages 18-60 at higher risk for RSV due to underlying medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes and COPD, and adults ages 18 and older who are immunocompromised and at high-risk for RSV.8 Pfizer also plans post-marketing studies and surveillance programs to further describe the safety of the vaccine.INDICATIONS FOR ABRYSVOABRYSVOTM is a vaccine indicated for:the prevention of lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in people 60 years of age and olderpregnant individuals at 32 through 36 weeks gestational age for the prevention of LRTD and severe LRTD caused by RSV in infants from birth through 6 months of ageIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR ABRYSVOABRYSVO should not be given to anyone with a history of sever allergic reaction (eg, anaphylaxis) to any of its componentsFor pregnant individuals: to avoid the potential risks of preterm birth, ABRYSVO should be given during 32 through 36 weeks gestational ageFainting can happen after getting injectable vaccines, including ABRYSVO.

Yahoo Finance's Anjalee khemlani is following the story and joins us now for more. Anje, the details, please.ANJAEE KHEMLANI: Absolutely, Jared. So we know, of course, that the World Health Organization has been tracking a number of variants. And here in the US, we're starting to see an uptick of one, that's EG5, nicknamed Araiza unofficially or Eris unofficially as well as the BA.2.86. That is another one that has caused some concern-- EG5 of concern because of the fact that it is a little bit more immune evasive.But that is all in the contributing to the story of these vaccine makers up on the news that there is something to be concerned about. We know that they have all demonstrated some efficacy against this new variants, even though they have been programmed and formulated to fight the Xb15. If you remember, that was the Omicron variant at the time.This new one EG5, all of these variants that we're seeing are part of that broader sub lineage, that Omicron family. So the expectation is that they should be effective come the fall when they do need those shots. Now it's important to note that the three vaccine players Moderna, Pfizer, and Novavax are yet to get approval from the FDA. They're still conducting their efficacy trials and should hear soon.There are some concerns that the rollout might not take place in September as planned, but there still is a timeline of waiting. So we have to wait and see how that all pans out. But as of right now, experts aren't warning that this is necessarily going to drive a surge the way that we've seen in the past during the pandemic, but definitely are seeing an uptick in cases attributable to these new variants. It's something to keep an eye on out for as the fall continues.JARED BLIKRE: So we know you will keep an eye on all of that for us. Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani, thank you.]"
193,6e2abbdb-f3bc-4e04-af22-ccddd2fc5d7a,PFE,2023-08-22,Medicare drug price negotiations unlikely to be derailed by lawsuits: UBS,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medicare-drug-price-negotiations-unlikely-to-be-derailed-by-lawsuits-ubs-165832314.html,1692637112,STORY,"['LLY', 'JNJ', 'BAYRY', 'BAYZF', 'BMY', 'PFE', 'ALPMF', 'ALPMY', 'AZN', 'AZNCF', 'AMGN', 'ABBV', 'MRK']","[Lawsuits brought by big pharmaceutical companies and industry lobbying groups are unlikely to delay Medicare's drug pricing negotiations, Wall Street analysts say.The industry is anxiously awaiting the Sept. 1 release of the first 10 drugs the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) will target for new negotiated prices.The negotiated prices are slated to go into effect in 2026, but many of the companies whose products are suspected to be on the inaugural list have already filed suit against the US Health Department, which oversees CMS, and US Health Secretary Xavier Becerra.""We believe these strategies are unlikely to result in an intended pause/delay of IRA implementation; conversely, the Department of Justice has criticized the Chamber's request to delay the drug price negotiation process,"" analysts at UBS wrote in a note to clients on Monday.Merck (MRK), Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ), Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY), and Astellas Pharma (ALPMY) are among the companies suing, along with trade groups PhRMA and the US Chamber of Commerce. AARP joined in the battle, filing an amicus brief on behalf of HHS on Friday. J&amp;J and Bristol have asked for their lawsuits to be merged, and several have asked for summary judgement, which would avoid a drawn-out trial process.Various lists have been published in an attempt to guess which products CMS will target.UBS includes some common assumptions like Merck's diabetes drug Januvia, J&amp;J and Bayer's blood thinner Xarelto, Pfizer (PFE) and Bristol's blood thinner Eliquis, J&amp;J and AbbVie's (ABBV) cancer drug Imbruvica, and Pfizer and Astellas's Xtandi.Bottles and pills of Xarelto, marketed by Janssen Pharmaceutical, sit on a counter at a pharmacy in Provo, Utah, Jan. 9, 2020. (George Frey/REUTERS)Some of these are listed in the lawsuits brought on by the companies who anticipate being targeted.UBS has also included AstraZeneca's (AZN) Farxiga, Amgen's (AMGN) Enbrel, Astellas's Myrbetriq, and Boehringer Ingelheim's Spiriva, and its Jardiance with Eli Lilly (LLY).Story continuesThe companies will have until Oct. 1 to sign an agreement to begin negotiations with CMS. And in UBS's view, this process actually getting underway could take some pressure off the sector.""Although the beginning of IRA implementation is a watershed moment for the industry, we argue that the next 1-2 steps could see overhang removal for the Pharma sector in the near term,"" UBS said.The lawsuits cite either the First, Fifth, or Eighth Amendments, alleging the powers granted to Medicare by Congress in the Inflation Reduction Act are unconstitutional.""Given that IRA disallows 'administrative and judicial review' of how CMS determines negotiation-eligible drugs and maximum fair prices, lawsuits are challenging the implementation on constitutional grounds,"" UBS wrote.Some legal experts see this strategy as a likely path to the Supreme Court.UBS analysts echoed a similar sentiment, saying the lawsuits, filed in various district courts around the country, could help fast-track the suits to what they called a ""business-friendly"" Supreme Court.The lawsuits citing the First Amendment claim the companies believe their freedom of speech is being taken away as they are only given a negotiation window, but not a chance to opt out of the negotiations.The lawsuits citing the Fifth Amendment claim the lack of option qualifies as government seizure of their property, and the Eighth Amendment was cited for excessive fines — or the penalty that Medicare can levy for noncompliance.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhem.Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

If you want to skip our introduction to the biotechnology industry and want to take a look at the top five stocks in this list, then head on over to 5 Most Profitable Biotech Stocks Today. Biotechnology is one of the fastest growing industries these days. Its successes have been influenced in a large amount by the advances in technology which have enabled biotechnology companies to develop new treatments, medicines, and products with the computing power that was unavailable just a decade ago. One technology that has been at the center of the attention of both the stock market and the media is artificial intelligence. In the biotech industry there are many companies using AI to make innovative treatments. One firm that has been using AI and machine learning in biotechnology for years now is Atomwise. The company uses a computational neural network (CNN) to discover billions of small molecules for drug development. As of 2023, Atomwise has generated more than $174 million in funding from venture capital financing, and the company also has a partnership with the pharmaceutical giant Sanofi (NASDAQ:SNY) for a deal that can potentially be worth $1 billion to discover medical compounds that will exclusively be used by Sanofi.Another firm that integrated AI into its operations before the recent hype is Eyenuk, Inc. It uses its AI platform called EyeArt to not only screen for eye diseases based on images but also predict whether such diseases can occur in the future. The firm scored a big win in June 2023 when the FDA approved a camera to be used with its EyeArt system to detect diabetic retinopathy.These developments make it clear that the biotechnology sector is perhaps one of the most revolutionary industries these days. They also show that the industry has a lot of potential apart from developing vaccines for the coronavirus pandemic - which itself has proved to be a major catalyst for the sector. Another big catalyst that might make biotechnology one of the most lucrative industries in the world is its ability to develop treatments for some of the most deadly and painful diseases known to humans. These diseases are collectively referred to as cancer, and cancer can affect a lot of body organs which makes it difficult to develop treatments since each different kind of cancer has its own mutations. Cancer treatments are further complicated by the fact that while some options do exist, cancer cells often evolve to defeat them.Story continuesOn this front, researchers from New York University's Langone Health Center have researched new antibodies to biologically 'mark' the cancer cells so that the body's immune system can target them and fight the disease. The treatment shows potential as a lab study with dish grown cancer cells saw immune system antibodies successfully recognize the cancer cell 'flags' and attack them as a result. Another firm that is leveraging biotechnology and artificial intelligence to fight cancer is Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE:A). Agilent has partnered up with another company, Visiopharm, to use AI for sifting through datasets for recognizing biological patterns in images to diagnose the correct diseases for an effective treatment plan.However, not all is rosy in the biotechnology industry. While the technologies, developments, and treatments that we've shared above have immense potential, the simple fact is that these technologies cost vast sums of money simply for research and development. At the same time, the fruits of this spending might take years to appear, which often ends up making several biotechnology firms unprofitable. To gauge a sense of just how capitally intensive spending in the biotechnology industry is, consider the fact that according to Deloitte, the average cost of developing a drug sits at a whopping $2.3 billion at the biggest biopharmaceutical companies in the world. At the same time, the return on investment on these drugs sits at just 1.2% - so the biotechnology companies have to be absolutely certain of future market potential and profitability when investing in drugs.As to the biotechnology companies themselves, we made a list of the 10 Most Promising Biotech Stocks According to Analysts to find out that the top firms were Zai Lab Limited (NASDAQ:ZLAB), Vir Biotechnology, Inc. (NASDAQ:VIR), and Intellia Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA). Here is what the management of Vir Biotechnology had to say during its latest earnings call:Now, let’s turn to chronic hepatitis B. Unlike the current standard-of-care, which requires taking antiviral medicines for the rest of one’s life and does not eliminate the risk of cirrhosis or liver cancer, our goal is a functional cure. After completing a functional cure therapy, there should be no need for further treatment and there should also be a further reduction in the risk of liver complications. Our functional cure hypothesis is based on a novel widely accepted belief that chronic hepatitis B is an immunologic disease caused by a virus. As such, we believe that combinations of anti-virus alone are not enough. Instead, we believe functional cure requires a combination of antivirus with immunologic agents.We call our approach stop and clear. We stop the virus from replicating and clear already infected cells by immune-stimulation. This is the fundamentally different hypothesis we seek to prove in our clinical trials. Our clinical development pathway has been as follows. We began with Phase 1 and Phase 2a studies that are exploring different combinations of anti-virals and immunomodulators. By specifically using small courts in these studies, we are able to explore a broad space of possibilities to help identify the right combination, dose, duration, frequency, and population. In the studies, we have made two major advances towards a functional cure for chronic hepatitis B that highlight why we believe we can succeed. One, At 11 June, we showed that we could achieve a durable off treatment response in 16% of participants who received VIR-2218, and pegylated interferon alpha for 48 weeks.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the most profitable biotechnology companies in the world out of which the top picks are Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Pfizer Inc.

Though not identified, Polkadot, Near, Optimism and Cosmos are chains Circle has said it planned to add in 2023.Cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase (COIN) is getting a minority stake in Circle Internet Financial and the companies are dissolving their Centre Consortium partnership that had issued USD Coin (USDC), the world’s second-largest stablecoin.As part of the move, Circle will bring issuance and governance of USDC fully in-house.Also, six more blockchains will gain native support for USDC, which is pegged to $1, bringing the total number of supported blockchains to 15.Coinbase and Circle, in a blog post and interviews with CoinDesk, didn’t disclose how big a stake Coinbase got. Coinbase did not give Circle cash for the stake, according to a person familiar with the matter.Coinbase and Circle did not identify the six additional blockchains. (Back in September, Circle said it planned to add Polkadot, Near, Optimism and Cosmos in 2023. Subsequent to that, Coinbase started its own blockchain called Base.)There have been recent tectonic shifts in the world of dollar-pegged stablecoins. Most recently, fintech giant PayPal took a step to shake up the dominance of Tether’s USDT and USDC by introducing its own PYUSD token, in association with Paxos; PayPal could prove a worthy adversary given its deep ties in payments and remittances.From Coinbase’s perspective, the future of USDC stretches far beyond crypto trading, into areas like foreign exchange, transfers of funds across borders and financial inclusion, according to Phil McDonnell, senior director of product management at Coinbase. But he played down any competition with PayPal.PayPal’s PYUSD ‘grows the pie’“I really do believe PayPal grows the pie for us,” McDonnell said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Crypto is so small today compared to the overall financial world. And, so, getting a lot of people in, whether they come through the PayPal door, or some other door, a lot of them eventually will find their way to other things in crypto, including us at Coinbase.”Story continuesRegulation of stablecoins remains in its early evolutionary stages, but there are squibs of clarity emerging, said Circle Chief Strategy Officer and Head of Global Policy Dante Disparte. He pointed to the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act of 2023, which has won bipartisan support on a key committee in the U.S. House of Representatives. Disparte also pointed out that Circle recently earned a Major Payment Institution License in Singapore.“Not only are we at a point where we can retire the Centre Consortium, but doing so makes patent sense because of clarity in the marketplace around regulating stablecoins,” Disparte said in an interview with CoinDesk. “Major companies like PayPal are entering the game and there’s sufficient clarity to abandon what was, for lack of a better term, a stablecoin self-regulatory organization structure.”BlackRock, FidelityCircle also sold stakes last year, raising $400 million from a group including asset managers BlackRock and Fidelity Investments – which have both recently made a splash by attempting to issue spot bitcoin ETFs.Circle announced last month it was cutting some of its workforce in order to maintain a strong balance sheet and focusing on core business activities.“Coinbase and Circle will continue to generate revenue from USDC reserves interest income,” according to the blog post. “Under the parties’ new arrangement, this revenue will continue to be shared based on the amount of USDC held on each of our platforms, and additionally we will now equally share in interest income generated from the broader distribution and usage of USDC.”CORRECTION (Aug. 21, 2023, 20:26 UTC): Fixes the spelling of Dante Disparte's last name.UPDATE (Aug. 21, 2023, 21:09 UTC): Adds that Coinbase didn't give Circle cash for the stake.CORRECTION (Aug. 21, 2023, 21:30 UTC): Corrects the level of support that the Clarity for Payment Stablecoins Act has received in the U.S. Congress.]"

This product will be generally available in Q4 2023, and is being designed to help accelerate COBOL application modernization. Watsonx Code Assistant for Z will preview during TechXchange, IBM's premier technical learning event in Las Vegas, Sept 11-13.Watsonx Code Assistant for Z is a new addition to the watsonx Code Assistant product family, along with IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Red Hat Ansible Lightspeed, scheduled for release later this year. These solutions will be powered by IBM's watsonx.ai code model, which will have knowledge of 115 coding languages1 having learned from 1.5 trillion tokens.2 At 20 billion parameters, it is on target to become one of the largest generative AI foundation models for code automation.3 The watsonx Code Assistant product portfolio will extend over time to address other programming languages, to improve time to value for modernization and address growing skills challenges for developers.Watsonx Code Assistant for Z is being designed to assist businesses in leveraging generative AI and automated tooling to accelerate their mainframe application modernization – all with the goal of preserving the performance, security and resiliency capabilities of IBM Z.The COBOL data processing language supports many vital business and operational processes at organizations globally. At scale, using watsonx Code Assistant for Z in comparison to other approaches could make it easier for developers to selectively and incrementally transform COBOL business services into well architected high-quality Java code – with estimated billions of lines of COBOL code as potential candidates for targeted modernization over time. Generative AI can help developers to more quickly assess, update, validate and test the right code, allowing them to more efficiently modernize large applications and focus on higher impact tasks.Story continuesIBM is designing these capabilities to provide tooling for each step of the modernization journey. The solution is expected to include IBM's Application Discovery and Delivery Intelligence (ADDI) inventory and analysis tool. Following ADDI, key steps on the journey include refactoring business services in COBOL, transforming COBOL code to Java code with an optimized design, and validating the resulting outcome, including using automated testing capabilities. Potential benefits for clients include:Accelerating code development and increasing developer productivity throughout the application modernization lifecycleManaging total cost, complexity, and risk of application modernization initiatives, including translation and optimization of code in-place on IBM ZExpanding access to a broader pool of IT skills and accelerating developer onboardingAchieving high quality, easy to maintain code through model customization and the application of best practices""Our collaboration with IBM is an important element in our drive to leverage generative AI interfaces to challenge legacy approaches with material productivity gains, and reinvent our Capital Markets solutions,"" said Roger Burkhardt, CTO, Capital Markets and AI, Broadridge Financial. ""We have had excellent client response to our generative AI investments and we are intrigued by the opportunity to further our efforts by leveraging IBM watsonx Code Assistant for Z to address a broader range of platforms.""AI-assisted mainframe application modernization is an imperativeAccording to new research from the IBM Institute for Business Value, organizations are 12x more likely to leverage existing mainframe assets rather than rebuild their application estates from scratch in the next two years. At the same time, however, the study shows that the number one challenge for those same organizations is a lack of resources and skills.""By bringing generative AI capabilities through watsonx to new use cases, we plan to drive real progress for our clients,"" said Kareem Yusuf, PhD, Senior Vice President, Product Management and Growth, IBM Software. ""IBM is engineering watsonx Code Assistant for Z to take a targeted and optimized approach. It's built to rapidly and accurately convert code optimized for IBM Z, accelerate time to market and broaden the skills pool. This can help enhance applications and add new capabilities while preserving the performance, resiliency, and security inherent in IBM Z.""There are many application modernization approaches available today. Some options include rewriting all application code in Java, or migrating everything to public cloud, which may sacrifice capabilities that are core to the IBM Z value proposition while failing to deliver on expected cost reduction. Tools that convert COBOL applications to Java syntax can produce code that is hard to maintain and can be unrecognizable to a Java developer. Generative AI is promising, but current AI-assisted partial re-write technology lacks COBOL support and doesn't optimize the resulting Java code for the given task.The resulting Java code from watsonx Code Assistant for Z will be object-oriented. IBM is designing this solution to be optimized to interoperate with the rest of the COBOL application, with CICS, IMS, DB2, and other z/OS runtimes. Java on Z is designed to be performance-optimized versus a compared x86 platform.4Building on a foundation of governance and innovationAccording to a 2023 Gartner® report (For Gartner Subscribers only), ""by 2028, the combination of humans and AI assistants working in tandem could reduce the time to complete coding tasks by 30%."" The report further states that ""the use of AI code generation tools is not replacing the quality assurance (QA) processes and security controls that are needed by developers for robust and secure product development, as well as for mitigation of inherited risks from using generative methods for code.""5Protecting sensitive data and customer intellectual property are critical when it comes to implementing generative AI. IBM for decades has followed core principles, grounded in commitments to Trust and Transparency. With this principle-based approach, the watsonx platform aims to enable enterprises to leverage their own trusted data and IP to build tailored AI solutions that are scalable across operations.Additionally, IBM Consulting brings deep domain expertise in IBM Z application modernization with a focus on guiding clients that leverage the platform across key industries such as banking, insurance, healthcare and government. These dedicated consultants can help clients identify the right application areas to modernize in order to optimize the potential benefits of watsonx Code Assistant for Z.

Over 1,000 farmers are using this technology solution to eliminate crop residue burning, and by 2024, the teams are aiming to engage with 12,000 farmers.Promoting sustainable agriculture in IndiaIn North India, not too far from the Himalayas, is Punjab. With an area of only 1.5% of total land in the country, Punjab is known as the ""breadbasket"" of India. According to recent studies, the rich soil in this state has contributed in the past about 40% of India's wheat and 30% of its rice. With the surplus productivity in these two crops compared to other places in the world, Punjab has positioned itself as a major contributor of crops on a global scale.However, at the end of each harvest, farmers in North India often resort to burning crop residue. This practice refers to the process of burning the leftover plant material after the main harvest, such as straw, stubble, and other agricultural residues in fields. The residue burning is mostly prevalent during the paddy harvest and subsequent sowing of wheat, which takes place in October and November. Farmers use this option as a quick and inexpensive way to clear the fields and prepare them for the next planting season. However, this process results in air pollution and soil degradation which have major consequences for public health and the environment. Burning crop residue is easy but in many ways damaging as it impacts both millions of people and acres of farmland.Many farmers in North India want to change this practice and government officials, communities and organizations are looking to support them. What has been missing so far? Data and technology, two critical elements that can bring all of them together to achieve this goal.Story continuesIn the pursuit of long-lasting solutions, TNCC has partnered with IBM to leverage the necessary technology and data resources. Together, they are trying to address this challenge with the aim of fostering agricultural sustainability and reducing the impact of climate change on communities. By leveraging advanced data analytics and accessible mobile technology, TNCC is leading the charge in transforming sustainable agriculture practices and protecting vulnerable populations from the effects of pollution and climate change.Watch: Transforming sustainable agriculture: The Nature Conservancy Centre and IBM unite to reduce crop residue burning in North IndiaIntroducing CRM Connect: A catalyst for changeRecognizing the urgent need to transition from crop residue burning to crop residue management (CRM), TNCC partnered with IBM through the IBM Sustainability Accelerator to develop CRM Connect-a powerful public information platform. Built by IBM developers and tapping into the climate analytics expertise of IBM Consulting's sustainability, climate and weather analytics expertise, CRM Connect serves as a tool to promote regenerative farming practices in India through the use of demographic insights, agricultural activity tracking, and resource mapping. Overall, CRM Connect improves agricultural sustainability and mitigates harm to the region's air and soil quality.The CRM Connect dashboard offers valuable intelligence to sector practitioners, government officials, and policy makers-analyzing data from various sources including weather patterns, soil conditions, and demographic information. CRM Connect fills the insights gap for transitioning to sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices.""This solution has the potential to create maximum impact. Using technology, we have been able to analyze data sets that let us identify 2,500 villages (out of over 18,000 villages across Punjab and Haryana) that concentrate 70% of the total fire events that came from paddy residue burning over the last 4-5 years,"" explains Manoj Singh, Lead for Regenerative Agriculture at TNCC. ""These types of valuable insights allow decision makers to focus resources where you can make a greater impact.""On the other hand, the platform also creates a network through the CRM Connect web portal, facilitating collaboration among farmers. Through this application, farmers can connect, share information, find CRM service providers for their operations, and offer support, overall fostering a sense of community and empowerment.Empowering farmers and cultivating changeFollowing this two-sided approach of sharing demographic insights with policymakers and information with farmers, TNCC's collaboration with IBM via the CRM Connect platform has the potential to empower stakeholders in India to adopt more sustainable agriculture practices. By providing critical information and fostering connections, TNCC is playing a pivotal role in shifting mindsets and inspiring positive change within communities. Thousands of farmers have eagerly embraced this opportunity, demonstrating their commitment to sustainable agriculture and a desire for a healthier, more resilient future.""Today, over 1,000 farmers are using the web portal covering approximately 2,200 hectares of land. And by the end of this year, the platform aims to engage 12,000 famers, thus impacting over 25,000 hectares,"" says Premjit Balasundaram, IBM's project leader.Looking ahead: A vision for greater impactThe impact of TNCC's partnership with IBM extends beyond their current goals. With a vision to reach over two million farmers in the long term, TNCC aims to create a ripple effect throughout the region and beyond. TNCC aspires to inspire a national and global shift towards regenerative agriculture, protecting vulnerable populations and safeguarding the environment for future generations. CRM Connect is a useful tool for the path to achieve this vision.As a next step, the project aims to leverage Artificial Intelligence to run more complex correlations that offer even more valuable and precise insights to farmers, organizations, and policymakers. The teams have identified 86 variables that could be analyzed using AI to promote these efforts further.Together, TNCC and IBM are creating a better and more sustainable world for all.Learn more about the IBM Sustainability Accelerator stories of impactView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from IBM on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: IBMWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/ibmEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: IBMView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/775633/Transforming-Sustainable-Agriculture-The-Nature-Conservancy-Centre-and-IBM-Unite-To-Reduce-Crop-Residue-Burning-in-North-India]"

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +1.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has gained 1.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $2.13 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.43 points to a change of +3.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.9%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.84 indicates a change of +4.3% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $14.81 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $61.48 billion and $64.08 billion estimates indicate +1.6% and +4.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $15.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -0.4%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $2.31 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.54 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.42%. The EPS surprise was +9%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They were also tasked with removing invasive plant life that was harming the bluffland's native vegetation.""Just the level of participation was incredible.

After rallying 20% higher over the first seven months of 2023, the index of the 500 largest stocks on the market is down 2.5% so far this month. Even after the gains, the benchmark index remains 7% below its all-time high. That means if you know where to look you’ll find undervalued large-cap stocks worth your consideration.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsDespite the market’s push higher in 2023, the following seven undervalued large-cap stocks still look ripe for the picking. You just might want to consider buying them now before the trade winds begin blowing again. Once their sails fill, their valuations won’t be nearly as attractive as they are right now, so take a good look at some of these undervalued large-cap stocks.CVS Health (CVS)Source: Roman Tiraspolsky / Shutterstock.comShares of pharmacy chain CVS Health (NYSE:CVS) are down 30% from last year because of worries about a recession and fears of legal exposure to the opioid crisis. It was alleged the pharmacy failed to oversee the dispensing of opioids from its stores. CVS has since agreed to pay $5 billion over 10 years.Coupled with its double-digit growth in its pharmacy benefit management business and robust growth still in pharmacy sales, CVS Health is deeply discounted at just eight times next year’s earnings estimates, a fraction of its sales, and an incredible five times the free cash flow it produces. This is one of the undervalued large-cap stocks that’s a no-brainer.Cisco Systems (CSCO)cisco (CSCO) logo on an office buildingSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comLong considered the backbone of the internet, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) has evolved into so much more today. But the blue chip tech stock has also struggled as a result. The rise of Zoom Video and Microsoft Teams meant businesses relied less on its conferencing hardware. Cybersecurity remains a threat to corporations, but they’re not spending as much as they were previously. That resulted in softer sales for Cisco’s end-to-end security services. Story continuesSupply chain disruptions also made it harder for Cisco to obtain materials for its routers, switches, and other networking hardware.The situation is normalizing, though. Growth is returning. Revenue is up 9% year to date with adjusted earnings 7% higher from last year. Cisco expects adjusted earnings to be 13% higher for the full year.Even though the stock isn’t battered like CVS’s, it’s still one of the big-name undervalued large-cap stocks out there. They trade at 13 times next year’s estimates and the free cash flow it generates. With a dividend that yields 2.9% annually, Cisco is a large-cap stock to buy.Molson Coors Beverage (TAP)Molson Coors (TAP) logo on a web browser magnified by a magnifying glassSource: OleksandrShnuryk / Shutterstock.comBrewer Molson Coors Beverage (NYSE:TAP) realized the secular decline in beer drinking meant it needed to broaden its portfolio. It now includes hard seltzers, ready to drink beverage,s and a variety of non-alcoholic beverage offerings. The company also signified the change by renaming itself from Molson Coors Brewing to Molson Coors Beverage.Beer still drives the brewer’s revenue, but it’s taking a more holistic look at drinks. For example, it just acquired Blue Run Spirits, a distiller of premium bourbon and rye whiskies.Molson Coors is also capitalizing on the problems of its rivals. The marketing debacle of Anheuser-Busch InBev saw its No. 1 selling Bud Light brand topple to fourth place. While Constellation Brands Corona beer is now the top-selling beer, Molson Coors arguably is faring best. According to data from Union, a hospitality market firm, Miller Lite beer was launched into the top spot in restaurants and bars with a 20.7% sales gain in June. Coors Light surged to the No. 3 position with a 19.4% sales jump.The stock goes for only 11 times free cash flow and it offers a dividend yielding 2.6% annually.Chevron (CVX)Chevron Earnings: CVX Stock Sinks Amid Spending CutsSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comShares of integrated oil and gas giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) are down 9% in 2023. The stock trades at just 10 times trailing earnings and 11 times next year’s estimates. The decline in oil prices had some big investors running for the exits in June. They bailed too soon.Where West Texas Intermediate oil had fallen to $70 a barrel it’s since rebounded to $82 a barrel as of this writing. Brent crude is also up $10 to $86 a barrel. Demand hit a record high in July and is expected to spike further this year.Chevron is in the driver’s seat here. It possesses superior financial rigor with a strong balance sheet that could withstand a drop in oil prices to $50 a barrel and still be profitable.The oil giant also just completed the acquisition of PDC Energy (NYSE:PDC) for $7.6 billion in an all-stock deal. That will boost Chevron’s proved oil equivalent reserves by 10% for less than $7 per barrel.Look for this large-cap stock to rally higher as the oil boom returns.Halliburton (HAL)photo of Halliburton (HAL) logo in red on building with truck in frontSource: hkhtt hj / Shutterstock.comIn that same vein is oil and gas services behemoth Halliburton (NYSE:HAL) to jump higher as well. CEO Jeff Miller believed it was inevitable there would be a resurgence in oil demand. “It’s clear to me that oil and gas is in short supply, and only multiple years of increased investment in both stemming declines and reserve additions will solve short supply. I believe these investments will drive demand for oilfield services for the next several years,” he told investors earlier this year. Halliburton provides services to oil and gas companies drilling wells. It is responsible for most of the hydraulic fracturing (fracking) operations in the U.S. As Miller also notes, “the fact is operators don’t produce more without fracking wells.”Halliburton stock is also cheap at 15 times trailing earnings and 11 times estimates. Analysts also expect the industry services firm to grow earnings almost 24% annually for the next five years. That means the stock trades at just a fraction of those growth rates and is a bargain at these levels.JD.com (JD)JD stock, Jd.com, Tiger Global is a major investor in JDSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comI’ll admit I’m leery of investing in Chinese companies. The political uncertainty surrounding Beijing and global geopolitical tensions can make it a crapshoot. But online retailer JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is the exception that proves the rule.JD.com and sister e-tailer Alibaba fell hard from their 2021 highs due to a crackdown by China’s government into tech stocks. With the investigations winding down or over with, the online retailers have room to grow again.JD.com hosts the Chinese midyear shopping extravaganza known as 618 (June 18). It was first launched in 2004 to celebrate the retailer’s founding. This year the spectacle ran from the end of May through mid-June. JD.com did not release gross merchandise value sold, but said it was a record. Analysts estimate it rose 6% to 8% more than the $56 billion worth it sold last year.The online retailer’s stock is down 34% in 2023 and it’s trading at just fractions of its estimated earnings growth rate and sales. That makes it a cheap stock with plenty of upside ahead.Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM) logo on sign at office campusSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.comAfter hitting a 52-week low of $70 a share in June, agricultural products processor Archer-Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) has rallied 21% higher. It’s still 13% below its highs, but there’s good reason to think it will continue its march higher. In short, people have to eat.ADM processes oilseeds into vegetable oils and other food products. It also converts corn and wheat into products and ingredients used in food and beverages, some of which are used to make ethanol. It also makes flavors and additives for food, including animal food.Skyrocketing commodity prices boosted ADM’s business and its profits. It reported record earnings of $7.85 per share in 2022. With inflation cooling off, ADM is witnessing a return to the mean, which brought down the stock.A rebound is underway. Bloomberg Intelligence data indicates fuel demand is rising as prices fell. And cheaper grain made it more profitable to make ethanol. Reportedly profits surged by 70% this year to $0.80 per gallon.In addition to strong tailwinds, Archer-Daniels Midland is a Dividend King. It has a better than 50-year record of raising its dividend, which yields 2.1% currently. It has a payout ratio of just 24%, meaning there is plenty of room for further increases with sufficient safety.On the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in CVX stock.

210,292daa7d-8341-3e43-b17d-83ac931c3be4,UAL,2023-08-22,US airline pilots fight their unions to increase retirement age,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-airline-pilots-fight-unions-100641460.html,1692698801,STORY,['UAL'],"[By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Allison Lampert(Reuters) - Bo Ellis has been a devoted member of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) for nearly four decades, but the 64-year-old is waging a campaign against the union to extend his flying career.ALPA and other pilot unions oppose a bill in the U.S. Congress that seeks to raise the retirement age for commercial airline pilots to 67 from 65, arguing it will ""introduce new risk"" into the aviation system as no safety agency has studied its implications.The measure, however, is estimated to provide 5,000 pilots like Ellis the option to continue working over the next two years, according to the Regional Airline Association (RAA).Increasing the age limit by two years would also align pilot retirement with the minimum federal retirement age, allowing them to receive full social security benefits.Ellis, a head pilot at a U.S. carrier, said senior pilots are ""by far much safer"" due to experience, accusing ALPA of ""politicizing"" safety.""My own union is being discriminatory against me,"" he said.PILOTS LOBBY LAWMAKERSEllis has co-founded a coalition of thousands of pilots at carriers including Delta, United, American and Southwest Airlines to lobby for the legislation and has contacted over 200 lawmakers.In a statement, ALPA said it ""carefully"" considered and its elected representatives voted ""unanimously"" last October to reaffirm its opposition to an ""arbitrary change"" in the retirement age.""America did not establish the aviation safety gold standard by cutting corners when making significant changes to our complex, global aviation system,"" ALPA said.Rick Redfern, a Mesa Air pilot who was present at ALPA's October meeting, said the union's board merely approved its strategic plan which contains its position on age. But the specific question of increasing the retirement age to 67 was never brought to the floor for a vote. Two other pilots, present at the meeting, confirmed Redfern's account.Story continuesInternal emails reviewed by Reuters and interviews with a dozen pilots show members are divided over the age issue. Some of the pilots asked not to have their employers identified due to the risk of losing their jobs.In previously unreported developments, a proposal by Mesa pilots seeking a vote on the age limit is expected to be discussed at ALPA's national executive council in September, said Redfern.ALPA needs to ""get the pulse of the community,"" said Redfern, an ALPA representative for MESA pilots.Similarly, ALPA's unit at United Airlines is polling pilots on the issue for the first time in 16 years.""We are fully aware of the passion raised over the issue,"" ALPA said in an Aug. 3 memo to United pilots that was seen by Reuters.The measure, expected to be taken up by the U.S. Senate in September after its approval in the House of Representatives last month, can mitigate staffing gaps at carriers that have led to a reduction in air service to more than 300 U.S. airports.""It will provide some much-needed relief,"" said airline stocks analyst Savanthi Syth of Raymond James.JUNIOR VERSUS SENIOR PILOTSAll airline pilots are required to pass medical tests every six months and those older than 40 must undergo ECG heart screening annually. Additionally, all pilots have their skills regularly evaluated in flight simulators to ensure proficiency.Advocates of the measure said advancements in medical science have led to a better understanding of pilot incapacitation. They point to Canada, Japan and Australia, countries with either higher or no age limit for pilots.Also, pilots are allowed to fly corporate and charter jets beyond the age of 65.Take Dan Carr, a former Mesa captain who turned 66 this month and flies business jets. If he was allowed to retire at 67, Carr said he would have never left Mesa.""I feel like I'm at the pinnacle of my ability,"" he said.Some older pilots want to work longer to benefit from salary increases after enduring economic losses in the coronavirus pandemic during 2020-2021 and various airline bankruptcies.They accused union leaders of pandering to junior pilots, who outnumber senior aviators and fear a higher retirement age would hurt their career progression. ""This is a coup by junior pilots against senior pilots,"" said Allen Baker, who retired as a United Airlines pilot in June.ALPA said its stand on age is the result of a ""democratic process"" and reflects ""the will"" of its members.Baker, 65, shared an email with Reuters which he wrote to ALPA leadership at United weeks before his retirement, complaining about a ""slander campaign"" by junior pilots against senior members like him.Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for American Airlines pilots union, said pilots seeking higher retirement age want to keep earning longer.DIVIDED AIRLINESALPA said changes to aviation policy should not be done ""in the backrooms of Congress or at the behest of moneyed special interests."" It has warned the move could cause airline scheduling and pilot training issues, and require reopening pilot contracts as current international rules would still prevent pilots older than 65 from flying internationally.In an interview, ALPA head Jason Ambrosi said the measure would drive up airline costs and ticket prices for customers. He, however, did not provide any specific data to back his argument.Like pilots, airlines are also split. Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said pilots should be allowed to fly as long as they clear their medical tests, joining the global airline trade group, International Air Transport Association and the RAA, in supporting the legislation.But United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has said lifting the retirement age would not solve the pilot shortage.

211,eeb30518-bd07-30b2-9947-ee812a618f09,UAL,2023-08-22,FOCUS-US airline pilots fight their unions to increase retirement age,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/focus-us-airline-pilots-fight-100000929.html,1692698400,STORY,"['UAL', 'LUV']","[By Rajesh Kumar Singh and Allison LampertAug 22 (Reuters) - Bo Ellis has been a devoted member of the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA) for nearly four decades, but the 64-year-old is waging a campaign against the union to extend his flying career.ALPA and other pilot unions oppose a bill in the U.S. Congress that seeks to raise the retirement age for commercial airline pilots to 67 from 65, arguing it will ""introduce new risk"" into the aviation system as no safety agency has studied its implications.The measure, however, is estimated to provide 5,000 pilots like Ellis the option to continue working over the next two years, according to the Regional Airline Association (RAA).Increasing the age limit by two years would also align pilot retirement with the minimum federal retirement age, allowing them to receive full social security benefits.Ellis, a head pilot at a U.S. carrier, said senior pilots are ""by far much safer"" due to experience, accusing ALPA of ""politicizing"" safety.""My own union is being discriminatory against me,"" he said.PILOTS LOBBY LAWMAKERSEllis has co-founded a coalition of thousands of pilots at carriers including Delta, United, American and Southwest Airlines to lobby for the legislation and has contacted over 200 lawmakers.In a statement, ALPA said it ""carefully"" considered and its elected representatives voted ""unanimously"" last October to reaffirm its opposition to an ""arbitrary change"" in the retirement age.""America did not establish the aviation safety gold standard by cutting corners when making significant changes to our complex, global aviation system,"" ALPA said.Rick Redfern, a Mesa Air pilot who was present at ALPA's October meeting, said the union's board merely approved its strategic plan which contains its position on age. But the specific question of increasing the retirement age to 67 was never brought to the floor for a vote. Two other pilots, present at the meeting, confirmed Redfern's account.Story continuesInternal emails reviewed by Reuters and interviews with a dozen pilots show members are divided over the age issue. Some of the pilots asked not to have their employers identified due to the risk of losing their jobs.In previously unreported developments, a proposal by Mesa pilots seeking a vote on the age limit is expected to be discussed at ALPA's national executive council in September, said Redfern.ALPA needs to ""get the pulse of the community,"" said Redfern, an ALPA representative for MESA pilots.Similarly, ALPA's unit at United Airlines is polling pilots on the issue for the first time in 16 years.""We are fully aware of the passion raised over the issue,"" ALPA said in an Aug. 3 memo to United pilots that was seen by Reuters.The measure, expected to be taken up by the U.S. Senate in September after its approval in the House of Representatives last month, can mitigate staffing gaps at carriers that have led to a reduction in air service to more than 300 U.S. airports.""It will provide some much-needed relief,"" said airline stocks analyst Savanthi Syth of Raymond James.JUNIOR VERSUS SENIOR PILOTSAll airline pilots are required to pass medical tests every six months and those older than 40 must undergo ECG heart screening annually. Additionally, all pilots have their skills regularly evaluated in flight simulators to ensure proficiency.Advocates of the measure said advancements in medical science have led to a better understanding of pilot incapacitation. They point to Canada, Japan and Australia, countries with either higher or no age limit for pilots.Also, pilots are allowed to fly corporate and charter jets beyond the age of 65.Take Dan Carr, a former Mesa captain who turned 66 this month and flies business jets. If he was allowed to retire at 67, Carr said he would have never left Mesa.""I feel like I'm at the pinnacle of my ability,"" he said.Some older pilots want to work longer to benefit from salary increases after enduring economic losses in the coronavirus pandemic during 2020-2021 and various airline bankruptcies.They accused union leaders of pandering to junior pilots, who outnumber senior aviators and fear a higher retirement age would hurt their career progression.""This is a coup by junior pilots against senior pilots,"" said Allen Baker, who retired as a United Airlines pilot in June.ALPA said its stand on age is the result of a ""democratic process"" and reflects ""the will"" of its members.Baker, 65, shared an email with Reuters which he wrote to ALPA leadership at United weeks before his retirement, complaining about a ""slander campaign"" by junior pilots against senior members like him.Dennis Tajer, a spokesman for American Airlines pilots union, said pilots seeking higher retirement age want to keep earning longer.DIVIDED AIRLINESALPA said changes to aviation policy should not be done ""in the backrooms of Congress or at the behest of moneyed special interests."" It has warned the move could cause airline scheduling and pilot training issues, and require reopening pilot contracts as current international rules would still prevent pilots older than 65 from flying internationally.In an interview, ALPA head Jason Ambrosi said the measure would drive up airline costs and ticket prices for customers. He, however, did not provide any specific data to back his argument.Like pilots, airlines are also split. Frontier Airlines CEO Barry Biffle said pilots should be allowed to fly as long as they clear their medical tests, joining the global airline trade group, International Air Transport Association and the RAA, in supporting the legislation.But United Airlines CEO Scott Kirby has said lifting the retirement age would not solve the pilot shortage. Last year, he said 36% of the company's pilots aged 64 were out on sick, long-term, or short-term medical leave.Mesa's CEO Jonathan Ornstein said he would love to have pilots like former Mesa employee Carr fly longer. The airline's operations are suffering as it has lost 37% of its captains due to retirement and attrition since early 2022.""If the regulations permitted, I'd take them all back,"" he said.

AZUL is benefiting from a decrease in operating expenses and a surge in air-travel demand. Shares of AZUL have gained 56.4% so far this year, outperforming 12.7% growth of the industry it belongs to.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAzul incurred a loss (excluding $1.52 from non-recurring items) of 81 cents per share in the second quarter of 2023, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 70 cents. Loss per share was 94 cents in second-quarter 2022. Total revenues amounted to R$4,269.4 million ($862.7 million). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues was pegged at $908.3 million. Despite this lag, the top line increased 7.8% year over year as air-travel demand has improved.How is AZUL Doing?Azul is benefiting from a steady recovery in air-travel demand, especially on the international front. Due to this improvement in international traffic, consolidated traffic and capacity increased 10% and 8.4%, respectively, in second-quarter 2023 from the comparable year-ago period. Azul’s international traffic and capacity surged 93.8% and 95%, respectively, in the June quarter on a year-over-year basis. With more people taking to the skies, Azul’s passenger revenues, contributing 92.5% to the top line, increased 11% year over year (on higher total capacity) in second-quarter 2023.Further, Azul's fleet-modernization efforts are commendable. In second-quarter 2023, fuel consumption per available seat kilometers (ASK) was down 3.8% from the year-ago period due to AZUL's fleet transformation and fuel-management initiatives, which resulted in lower carbon emissions per ASK. Azul exited the second quarter of 2023 with a total passenger operating fleet of 181 aircraft. The average age of the fleet was 7.3 years. The contractual fleet size was 196.Declining operating expenses should boost AZUL's bottom line. Total operating expenses fell 2.9% from its year-ago levels in second-quarter 2023. The decrease was due to the 24.5% reduction in fuel price, cost-reduction initiatives and productivity gains. Cost per available seat kilometer also fell 10.5% year over year in the second quarter.Story continuesDespite such positives, AZUL's liquidity position remains a concern. Cash and cash equivalent of $130 million at the second quarter of 2023-end was lower than the $1,422 million of long-term debt. This implies that the company does not have enough cash to meet its debt burden.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, AZUL carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector are United Airlines (UAL) and SkyWest, Inc. (SKYW).

We remind investors that trucking firm Yellow Corporation had filed for bankruptcy earlier this month.The trucking company’s bankruptcy filing in a Delaware court estimated assets and liabilities in the range of $1-$10 billion, with more than 100,000 creditors.  Per CEO Darren Hawkins, “It is with profound disappointment that Yellow announces that it is closing.”Old Dominion’s bid exceeds that of Estes Express Lines, a privately owned freight transportation provider. Estes Express Lineshad offered $1.3 billion for Yellow’s North American real-estate holdings. ODFL’s offer comes after the bankrupt trucking company had accepted a $142.5 million loan from Citadel and MFN Partners to fund its liquidation. Along with allowing Yellow more time to sell off its assets, this loan facilitates $27-$40 million savings in fees.Yellow Corporation’s collapse and the subsequent competing offers come at a time when the freight scenario is already weak. Due to the weakness pertaining to freight demand, Cass Freight Index declined 2.2% on a month-on-month basis in July. In fact, this index has dropped month on month in five out of the first seven months of the year.Zacks Rank &amp; Key PicksOld Dominion currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors interested in the Zacks Transportation sector may consider stocks like United Airlines UAL and Air Transport Services ATSG.

Retail sales for July were up 0.7% from the previous month, which was well above estimates of 0.4%. This among a number of other economic data points say one thing quite emphatically, the US economy is very strong. Further confirming this notion, is GDP growth estimates. The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta provides a nowcast estimating US annual economic growth and revised the number this week to 5.8%. Consumers Favor DiscountsHowever, contrary to this data, we saw an interesting trend emerge from the totality of these earnings. Consumers are shifting their buying patterns to make more purchases at discount retailers.While both Target and Home Depot beat earnings estimates, Target missed on sales, and both retailers are expecting slower growth over the next year. Home Depot reiterated its forward guidance after lowering the outlook last quarter and Target guided lower on both sales and revenue forecasts.Target CEO Brian Cornell noted on the earnings call that ""As we look at the consumer landscape today, we recognize the consumer is still challenged by the levels of inflation that they're seeing in food and beverage and household essentials...So that's absorbing a much bigger portion of their budget.""On the flip side, both Walmart and The TJX Companies raised forward guidance and beat sales and earnings estimates.Not too surprisingly, Walmart and The TJX Companies enjoy Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) ratings, while Target and Home Depot have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Story continuesThe TJX CompaniesThe TJX Companies is a leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide with 4,865 stores. The company's broad range of assortments at varying prices helps it to reach out to a broad range of consumers. Additionally, TJX attracts consumers through rapid turn of inventories, which makes for an always fresh range of discounted products.On Wednesday, TJX reported Q2 earnings. EPS came in at $0.85, a 23% YoY increase and well above estimates of $0.77. Sales $12.76 billion also beat estimates of $12.45 billion and showed a 7.7% YoY gain.TJX has begun to see analysts revise earnings estimates higher, with both FY23 and FY24 earnings being upgraded by 1% over the last month. Both sales and earnings are projected to grow at a very nice pace over the next two years.Shares of TJX blasted to all-time highs following the stellar earnings report and are now up 13.2% YTD. The TJX Companies stock has compounded at an annual rate of 14% over the last ten years, outperforming the broad market.TJX is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 25x, which is below the industry average of 27x, and above its 10-year median of 21.2x. Additionally, the company offers a dividend yield of 1.5% and has raised the payment by an average of 9.7% annually over the last five years.WalmartSurprisingly, Walmart shares are selling off following its exceptional earnings report. Nonetheless, the stock looks very appealing at the current levels, and new business verticals at the retail giant look to be paying off.WMT has been gaining momentum in two of its high margin revenue streams; advertisements and its membership program Walmart+. Walmart has added in-store ads in the aisles, on the checkout screens, and played over the stores radio, and has recruited its most engaged customers to its membership program. These developments have been critical in raising earnings expectations. The advertisement business grew a reported 36% YoY.Walmart also saw momentum in its e-commerce business. Online sales jumped 24% YoY.Analysts have taken notice and began raising earnings estimates over the last two months. Current quarter earnings estimates have been raised by 1.2%, and FY23 estimates by 0.6%.WMT is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 25.5x, which is above the industry average of 23.2x, and above its five-year median of 23.4x. The company also pays a dividend yield of 1.4% and has raised it by an average of 1.9% annually over the last five years.Target After trading immediately lower following the earnings report, Target stock has recovered and rallied ~5% off its 2023 lows. And while investors may want to wait for analysts to begin revising their earnings estimates higher, raising its Zacks Rank, TGT is now trading at a fairly compelling valuation.Target is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 16.2x, which is well below the industry average of 27x, and below its five-year median of 18.3x. The company also pays a dividend yield of 3.4% and has raised the payment by an average of 13% annually over the last five years.Admittedly, earnings estimates have been revised lower almost unanimously by analysts. Current quarter earnings estimates have been downgraded by -7.4% and FY23 earnings estimates by -4.5%.However, another point on the bullish side is that EPS are projected to grow nicely in the coming quarters. Current quarter earnings are expected to climb 23% YoY to $1.89 and FY23 EPS are forecast to grow 31% YoY to $7.88. This follows management's effort to build back profitability at the retailer.Target shares are now -50% off their all-time high. The stock has compounded at an annual rate of 8.1% over the last 20 years, underperforming the broad market.Home DepotHome Depot has compounded at an incredible 15% annually over the last 20 years, far outperforming the broad market. HD also offers a dividend yield of 2.5% and has raised it by an average of 14.5% annually over the last five years.However, as fantastic as the stock has been over the years, the near future may be a bit rocky. While HD reported EPS of $4.65 beating estimates of $4.45 it showed a YoY decline from $5.05. Sales also beat estimates and showed a slight decline YoY.The earnings revision trend has been mixed, giving HD a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), but forecasts are weak over the next year. Sales and earnings are expected to fall through the year end. Although there is a light at the end of the tunnel, sales and earnings growth are expected to resume in FY24.While HD management still believes their core customers are in a healthy place economically, the reality is that Covid pulled forward a lot of DIY home improvement sales. With people stuck at home during the pandemic, many homeowners opted to do work on their homes, and are not yet at the point where they need to do more.Home Depot is trading at a one year forward earnings multiple of 22.3x, which is above the market average of 20.6x, and just above its 10-year median of 21.2x.Bottom LineThe US economy is in an interesting position, and this week's retail earnings provided some useful information. Obviously, the economy is growing at a nice pace, however the average American is still dealing with a tight budget, forced to cut certain expenses to cover the necessities.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

222,00308320-3026-306c-bf06-33d88ecd2927,ISRG,2023-08-22,3 Reasons to Retain Intuitive Surgical (ISRG) in Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reasons-retain-intuitive-surgical-115500398.html,1692618900.0,STORY,"['ISRG', 'ITGR']","[Intuitive Surgical, Inc. ISRG is well poised for growth in the coming quarters, courtesy of its strength in robotics. The optimism, led by solid first-half 2023 results and its progress on the artificial intelligence (AI) front, is expected to contribute further. Risks pertaining to procedure adoption and stiff competition persist.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have risen 7.8% year to date against the industry’s 3.5% decline. The S&amp;P 500 Index has gained 15.1% during the same time frame.Intuitive Surgical, the pioneer of robotic-assisted surgery and the renowned provider of minimally invasive care, has a market capitalization of $100.47 billion. It projects 15.7% growth over the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance going forward.The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, delivering an average surprise of 4.19%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strength in Robotics: We are upbeat about Intuitive Surgical’s robot-based da Vinci surgical system that enables minimally-invasive surgery and reduces the trauma associated with open surgery. The da Vinci System is powered by robotic technology that has provided the company with solid exposure to medical mechatronics, robotics and AI for the healthcare space.On ISRG’s second-quarter 2023 earnings call in July, the company reported that the installed base of the da Vinci system grew approximately 13% year over year. The utilization of clinical systems in the field, measured by procedures per system, was up 9% from the prior-year quarter’s level.Progress on the AI Front: We are also positive about the growing adoption of minimally-invasive robot-assisted surgeries, self-automated home-based care, the use of information technology for quick and improved patient care, and the shift of the payment system to a value-based model. These indicate the high prevalence of AI in the MedTech space.Story continuesPer management, the rise of medical mechatronics, powerful computing, improved sensing, microfabrication and molecular imaging has enabled new solutions to old problems. AI has been enhancing Intuitive Surgical’s product portfolio with clinical applications, diagnostic support, operational efficiency, electronic health record systems, practice workflows and supply-chain management.Strong Q2 Results: The company ended the second quarter on a strong note, wherein both earnings and revenues beat their respective consensus mark. The company witnessed continued growth in its da Vinci procedure volume. Although COVID-19 cases adversely impacted its procedure volume in China during the quarter, the country plans to add 559 robotic systems in the coming years. Intuitive Surgical will provide some of these systems, mostly between 2024 and 2027. This will drive top-line growth significantly.DownsidesRisk of Procedure Adoption: Intuitive Surgical faces the risk of adoption of its procedures. This is because adoption growth takes time, as each procedure needs to gain credibility. Furthermore, the wide use of the company’s products requires training of surgical teams. Market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete such trainings.Stiff Competition: Since the launch of its flagship device, the da Vinci System, in 2000, Intuitive Surgical used to enjoy a monopoly in the market for robots used in surgery. However, the competition for ISRG intensified following the regulatory approval of Transenterix's surgical robot for abdominal surgery in 2017.Several other companies have introduced products in the field of robotic-assisted medical procedures or are developing products to enter the field.Estimate TrendISRG is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has moved 1.6% north to $5.56 per share.The consensus mark for the company’s third-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $1.77 billion, indicating a 14.7% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

(NASDAQ:ISRG) Worth US$286 Based On Its Intrinsic Value?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intuitive-surgical-inc-nasdaq-isrg-110034736.html,1692615634.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Intuitive Surgical fair value estimate is US$217Intuitive Surgical's US$286 share price signals that it might be 32% overvalued The US$362 analyst price target for ISRG is 67% more than our estimate of fair valueToday we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Intuitive Surgical The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.09bUS$2.66bUS$2.59bUS$3.15bUS$3.43bUS$3.67bUS$3.87bUS$4.04bUS$4.20bUS$4.34bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 8.93%Est @ 6.90%Est @ 5.47%Est @ 4.48%Est @ 3.78%Est @ 3.29% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$2.0kUS$2.3kUS$2.1kUS$2.4kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.4kUS$2.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$23bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.2%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.3b× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.2%) = US$100bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$100b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$53bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$76b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$286, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Intuitive Surgical as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.886. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Intuitive SurgicalStrengthCurrently debt free.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.ThreatRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value?

RCL has demonstrated remarkable performance, with its stock showing a significant jump of 162.6%. The industry increased 14.7% during the same period. Strong booking trends for both North American and European sailings continue to aid the company.Last month, RCL reported second-quarter 2023 results, with earnings and revenues beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The top and bottom lines rose on a year-over-year basis.For 2023, management expects depreciation and amortization expenses to be between $1,465 million and $1,475 million, down from the prior guided range of $1,470-$1,490 million. Net interest expenses (excluding loss on extinguishment of debt) are suggested in the $1,272-1,282 million band, which decreased from the earlier projection of $1,290-1,300 million.Adjusted EBITDA is estimated to surpass 2019 reported levels. Adjusted EPS is anticipated to be between $6 and $6.20, up from the previous prediction of $4.40-$4.80.Further, analysts are very optimistic about the company’s solid prospects. In the past 30 days, earnings estimate for 2023 has witnessed a 27.3% upward revision to $6.02 per share.Let’s delve deeper.Growth DriversThe Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company's booking volume has maintained a growing pace in second-quarter 2023, with notable momentum seen in 2023 and 2024 sailings. A major portion of the current bookings are directed toward sailings for the upcoming year. During the second quarter of 2023, RCL witnessed a robust North American consumer market and heightened bookings from Europe for summer vacations.As of Jun 30, 2023, North America-based sailings portrayed healthy booking trends, accounting for nearly 76% of the company’s capacity. Management noted better-than-expected load factors (at approximately 105%), owing to a rise in close-in bookings. It also stated that pricing (including and excluding FCCs) remained elevated from 2019 levels.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchRCL focuses on new innovative ships and onboard experiences to differentiate its offering as well as deliver superior yields and margins. In the first half of 2023, it unveiled three new ships that align with its strategy and are poised to generate higher yields from 2024 onward.

Maxx and Marshalls, all raised their full-year outlooks last week after reporting stronger than expected sales in the second quarter. These retailers, which live in the off-price and discount sector, benefited from a value-focused trend pushing consumers to save where they can during an uncertain economic environment.More from Footwear NewsTarget CEO Addresses Pride Controversy &amp; How the Chain Will Move Forward After Sales HitTJ Maxx Is Winning Bama Rush - and Gen Z“Customers are stretching their dollars further and seeking better value across more categories more often,” said Walmart CFO John Rainey in a call with investors last week. He also noted that sales of grocery staples and in-home meals saw an uptick, in addition to kitchen tools that can assist in at-home meal prep.“They’re also buying more necessities and focusing on lower-priced items and brands,” he said.Ross Stores’ CEO Barbara Rentler noted in a call with investors that consumers responded well to its “improved value offerings” throughout its stores. TJX Companies’ apparel business, including accessories, saw a high single-digit comp increase, despite the discretionary nature of that category.“Across the board in retail, we see a flight to value as shoppers look to make their budgets stretch further,” said managing director of GlobalData Neil Saunders in a statement. “Through its various banners, TJX is on the right side of these trends and is benefitting as a result. That said, we also recognize the skill that goes into creating a compelling assortment which makes consumers want to part with their money.”BTIG analyst Janine Stichter also surmised that the strong results across these three retailers suggest that value is resonating with consumers.“The relative strength in the value segment suggests a trade-down, notably in apparel where off-price is clearly outperforming full-price,” wrote BTIG analyst Janine Stichter in a Sunday note to investors. “The stronger relative performance of consumables and private label suggests consumers remaining judicious.”Story continuesThe outlier case among these companies was Target, which downgraded its full-year outlook after noting softer spending in discretionary categories. At the same time, several footwear brands this quarter experienced significant declines this quarter amid inventory excesses, a conservative wholesale environment and consumers who are spending less on discretionary categories. In the last few weeks, Adidas, Steve Madden, Skechers, Deckers, Puma and Columbia Sportswear have all specifically lamented the challenges in the U.S. market.Jane Hali &amp; Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez noted that recent store checks for TJX, Burlington Coat Factory and Ross all appeared to have strong traffic and that strong back-to-school assortments in each chain will likely continue to be a further tailwind for the channel through the summer“We continue to believe the off-price sector is best positioned during this difficult discretionary market,” Ramirez wrote in a note to clients. “The channel offers great value on branded product.”Best of Footwear NewsA History of Forever 21: From Humble Beginnings to Bankruptcy and the Shaquille O'Neal BouncebackFootwear Company CEOs You Should KnowList of Footwear Company CEOs You Should Know]"

229,74316ffa-1325-392e-8ea9-9ac38dcdc576,ROST,2023-08-22,5 Must-Buy S&P 500 Stocks Despite Benchmark's Recent Turmoil,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-must-buy-p-500-120400137.html,1692619440,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'CAT', 'ROST', 'PHM', 'ETN', 'PNR']","[Wall Street has seen an impressive bull run in 2023 after a highly disappointing 2022. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are up 4.1%, 13.8% and 27%, respectively. However, volatility has shown its ugly face once again in August owing to both internal and external factors.Consequently, month to date, the S&amp;P 500 Index is down 4.8%. Last week, the S&amp;P 500 fell 2.1%, marking its third-straight weekly loss, for the first time since February. The index’s last three-week loss of 4.6% is its biggest decline since the three weeks ended Mar 10.Nevertheless, the long-term trend of U.S. stock markets remains bullish. The inflation rate is dwindling steadily since June 2022. Fundamentals of the economy remain strong with a resilient labor market and solid consumer spending. These developments have brightened the chance of the Fed’s so-called “soft landing” and reduces the possibility of a near-term recession.At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in dividend-paying S&amp;P 500 stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that have provided positive returns in the past month with more upside left. If the index’s downturn continues, dividend will act as a regular income stream. If the benchmark resumes its northward journey, favorable Zacks Rank will capture the upsides.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five such stocks with strong potential for the rest of 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our pick sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

SBA Communications Corp (NASDAQ:SBAC) is one such stock that deserves attention. Currently priced at 216.83, the stock recorded a daily loss of 2.55% and a 3-month decrease of 6.66%. However, according to its GF Value, the fair valuation of the stock stands at $384.25.Understanding the GF ValueWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with SBAC. Click here to check it out. SBAC 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of SBACThe GF Value is a unique measure that represents the current intrinsic value of a stock. This estimation is derived from a combination of historical multiples, GuruFocus adjustment factors based on the company's past returns and growth, and future estimates of business performance. The GF Value Line on our summary page provides an overview of the fair value at which the stock should be traded.Unraveling the Value Trap: A Deep Dive into SBA Communications Corp (SBAC)Delving Deeper into SBA CommunicationsWhile the seemingly attractive valuation of SBA Communications (NASDAQ:SBAC) may catch an investor's eye, it's crucial to consider other risk factors associated with the company. These risks are primarily reflected in its low Altman Z-score of 0.49. This score suggests that SBA Communications, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap. Therefore, thorough due diligence is essential before making an investment decision.Understanding the Altman Z-ScoreThe Altman Z-score is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. Invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, the Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.A Closer Look at SBA CommunicationsSBA Communications owns and operates almost 40,000 cell towers throughout North America, South America, and Africa. It leases space on its towers to wireless service providers, who install equipment on the towers to support their wireless networks. Despite its global presence and seemingly undervalued stock, certain financial indicators suggest potential risks.Story continuesUnraveling the Value Trap: A Deep Dive into SBA Communications Corp (SBAC)Breaking Down SBA Communications's Low Altman Z-ScoreAn examination of SBA Communications's Altman Z-score reveals potential financial distress. The Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio, which provides insights into a company's ability to reinvest its profits or manage debt, has been on a declining trend. The historical data for this ratio - 2021: -0.68; 2022: -0.75; 2023: -0.69 - indicates SBA Communications's diminishing ability to reinvest in its business or effectively manage its debt, negatively impacting its Z-Score.Conclusion: A Potential Value Trap?Despite its seemingly attractive valuation, the financial indicators suggest that SBA Communications might be a potential value trap. The low Altman Z-score and declining Retained Earnings to Total Assets ratio indicate potential financial distress, underlining the importance of thorough due diligence before investing.

AFRM is set to report its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results on Aug 24, after the closing bell.What Do the Estimates Say?The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 loss per share of 86 cents suggests a 32.3% plunge from the prior-year loss of 65 cents. The estimate remained stable over the past week. The consensus estimate for fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues of $404.2 million indicates an 11% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Affirm beat on earnings in one of the trailing four quarters and missed thrice, the average negative surprise being 8.5%. This is depicted in the graph below.Affirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseAffirm Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Affirm Holdings, Inc. QuoteBefore we get into what to expect for the to-be-reported quarter in detail, it’s worth taking a look at AFRM’s previous-quarter performance first.Q3 Earnings RewindIn the last reported quarter, this leading payment network’s adjusted loss per share of 69 cents was 24.2% narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, thanks to improved virtual card network revenues and interest income. However, the positives were partially offset by deteriorated servicing and merchant network revenues and rising operating expenses.Now, let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings announcement.Q4 Factors to NoteThe company expects the weighted average shares outstanding to be 300 million in the to-be-reported quarter. Travel and entertainment-related spendings are expected to have been resilient in the quarter under review. This, in turn, is likely to have augmented the strength of active merchants and consumers.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for merchant network revenues is pegged at $130.1 million, indicating a jump of 10.1% from a year ago. Also, the consensus mark for servicing income indicates a 4.4% year-over-year increase to $22.5 million.The sales figures from the virtual card networks are anticipated to have risen. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for virtual card network revenues is pegged at $32.6 million, indicating a 3.3% year-over-year rise. Affirm anticipates fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 GMV to be $5.20-$5.35 billion, signaling a jump from $4.4 billion a year ago.Story continuesThe consensus mark for interest income in the fiscal fourth quarter is pegged at $186.6 million, indicating a 35.6% jump from the previous-year quarter’s $137.6 million, primarily due to the high interest rate environment.The above-mentioned factors are expected to have positioned the company for year-over-year top-line growth in the fiscal fourth quarter. However, the positives are likely to have been partially offset by lower gains on sales of loans and higher operating costs.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for gain on sales of loans suggests a 41.5% year-over-year decline to $32.4 million. The company expects transaction costs to be within $245-$255 million, significantly higher than the year-ago level of $179.8 million.Also, operating costs are likely to have increased in the quarter under review due to higher technology and data analytics, and funding costs, affecting the bottom line. Increased processing and servicing costs, as a result of growing volumes, are anticipated to have boosted the operating costs, reducing profits and making an earnings beat uncertain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Affirm this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company currently has an Earnings ESP of -18.15%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate currently stands at a loss of $1.02 per share, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 86 cents.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Affirm currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.How Other Stocks PerformedHere are some companies from the Business Services space that have already reported earnings for the June quarter: Mastercard Incorporated MA, Visa Inc. V and The Western Union Company WU.Mastercard reported second-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $2.89 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.8%. The quarterly results gained from strong consumer spending, specifically across the travel sector, and an enhanced services suite. Robust growth in cross-border volume also contributed to the upside. However, the performance was partly offset by an escalating operating cost level.Visa reported third-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings of $2.16 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.4%. Its solid quarterly results benefited from higher payments, cross-border volumes and processed transactions. Steady cross-border travel growth and higher-than-expected data processing aided the results, partially offset by increased costs.Western Union reported second-quarter 2023 earnings per share of 51 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 34.2%. WU’s earnings were supported by growth in business originating from Iraq, inflation in Argentina and better-than-expected C2C transactions. Evolve 2025’s momentum and strength in the Middle East business further benefited the results, partially offset by higher expenses.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Story continuesBased on GuruFocus' valuation method, KLA (NASDAQ:KLAC) appears to be fairly valued. The stock's fair value is estimated considering three key factors: historical multiples, an internal adjustment based on the company's past business growth, and analyst estimates of future business performance. If the stock's share price is significantly above the GF Value Line, the stock may be overvalued and have poor future returns. On the other hand, if the stock's share price is significantly below the GF Value Line, the stock may be undervalued and have high future returns. At its current price of $490.71 per share, KLA has a market cap of $67.10 billion and the stock shows every sign of being fairly valued.Because KLA is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Is KLA Corp (KLAC) Fairly Valued?

Based on this, GuruFocus ranks KLA's financial strength as 6 out of 10, suggesting a fair balance sheet. Here's a look at KLA's debt and cash over the past years:Is KLA Corp (KLAC) Fairly Valued? A Comprehensive AnalysisProfitability and Growth of KLAInvesting in profitable companies, especially those that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term, poses less risk. A company with high profit margins is also typically a safer investment than one with low profit margins. KLA has been profitable 10 over the past 10 years. Over the past twelve months, the company had a revenue of $10.50 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $24.09. Its operating margin is 38.06%, which ranks better than 96.47% of 936 companies in the Semiconductors industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks the profitability of KLA at 10 out of 10, which indicates strong profitability.Growth is probably the most important factor in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. The faster a company is growing, the more likely it is to be creating value for shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. The 3-year average annual revenue growth rate of KLA is 26.8%, which ranks better than 80.92% of 865 companies in the Semiconductors industry. The 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 40.6%, which ranks better than 72.92% of 768 companies in the Semiconductors industry.ROIC vs WACCAnother way of determining the profitability of a company is to compare its return on invested capital to the weighted average cost of capital. Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. When the ROIC is higher than the WACC, it implies the company is creating value for shareholders. For the past 12 months, KLA's return on invested capital is 37.17, and its cost of capital is 12.01. The historical ROIC vs WACC comparison of KLA is shown below:Is KLA Corp (KLAC) Fairly Valued?

If you want to see some more stocks on the list, go directly to 5 Stocks Getting a Huge Vote of Confidence From Wall Street Analysts.Stocks are heading into a challenging week, with several significant events on the horizon. These include Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's forthcoming speech at a Fed symposium in Wyoming and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDQ:NVDA) earnings scheduled to be released on August 23. Nvidia's projection of strong revenue growth in May was pivotal in driving the artificial intelligence rally that has propelled the S&amp;P 500 Index's approximately 14% climb this year. Even though historical data suggests that the S&amp;P 500 usually sees an increase in the week following the Fed symposium, options traders continue adding PUT options as a precaution against potential declines. Gold prices held above five-month lows on August 21 as investors turned their attention to the Jackson Hole central bankers' meeting. Spot gold increased 0.1% to $1,889.39 per ounce, with U.S. gold futures rising to $1,918.10. The focus is on U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's upcoming speech, discussing whether elevated inflation justifies higher long-term equilibrium interest rates.Goldman Sachs has lowered its China stock targets due to renewed concerns about the property sector, marking the second reduction in three months, reported Bloomberg. Economic pressures have led to fresh revisions in profit expectations. According to Goldman Sachs, Chinese stocks are expected to stabilize in a lower trading range than previous forecasts. This adjustment reflects a cautious approach until Beijing introduces more robust policy measures to address the risk of a property market decline. The bank has reduced its full-year earnings-per-share growth estimate for the MSCI China Index from 14% to 11%, and the 12-month index target has been revised down from 70 to 67, implying a 13% increase from the Friday closing level. On the oil front, prices have climbed for a third consecutive day due to indications of a tightening physical market and a pause in the dollar's recent surge. These factors have counterbalanced the growing concerns about demand in China and the US. Brent, the global benchmark, has surpassed $85 per barrel and has increased by over 2% since the previous Wednesday's closing. The oil market's upward momentum has been propelled by supply constraints enforced by major OPEC+ players Russia and Saudi Arabia since late June, while US crude inventories have declined to their lowest levels since January.Story continuesMeanwhile, across the stock market in the U.S., stocks such as Lumentum Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:LITE), Itron, Inc. (NASDAQ:ITRI), and American Woodmark Corporation (NASDAQ:AMWD) are getting a huge vote of confidence from the Wall Street analysts.

Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV)Price Reaction after the Upgrade: 0.00 (0%)On August 18, Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV) was given an upgraded recommendation from Stifel, now rated as a ""Buy"" rather than a ""Hold,"" driven by the positive impact of the Cobre Panama deal, which has alleviated concerns. Despite the limited movement in Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV) stock on Friday, this upgrade has sparked interest in the market. Stifel has set a price target of C$215 for the stock, highlighting the growth potential. The rationale behind this upgrade lies in the recent retraction of Franco-Nevada's valuation, creating an attractive opening for investors to enter the market.The recent development in Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV) journey is the Cobre Panama deal, which has played a pivotal role in reshaping the perceptions of the company's prospects. This deal has effectively addressed and lifted the overhang of uncertainties that previously surrounded the stock. The removal of this overhang has been viewed positively by Stifel, leading to their decision to upgrade the stock's rating.09. Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL)Price Reaction after the Upgrade: +0.03 (+0.05%)On August 18, B. Riley, a prominent financial institution, upgraded Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) rating from ""Neutral"" to ""Buy,"" signaling a shift in their outlook on the company's prospects. This upgrade comes with insightful observations regarding the anticipated surge in growth driven by artificial intelligence (AI). As part of this upgrade, B. Riley has also revised their price target for Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL), increasing it from $60 to $75. The decision to upgrade Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) rating reflects B. Riley's recognition of the company's potential to thrive in the current technological landscape. With AI poised to play a pivotal role in shaping industries and markets, Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) stands to benefit from the expected wave of growth propelled by AI-driven advancements. This strategic move by B. Riley signifies their confidence in Marvell Technology's capabilities to leverage AI technologies effectively and capitalize on emerging opportunities.The noteworthy aspect of this upgrade is the accompanying increase in the price target for Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL). By raising the price target from $60 to $75, B. Riley is essentially forecasting that the company's stock value has the potential to reach higher levels. This adjusted price target reflects B. Riley's assessment of Marvell Technology's ability to generate value, capture market share, and potentially outperform previous expectations.Baron Opportunity Fund made the following comment about Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We took advantage of weakness to purchase shares of Marvell Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRVL), a leading supplier of infrastructure semiconductor solutions that enable the rapid and efficient movement of data throughout the broader data economy, from the data center core to the network edge. Through both organic development and acquisitions led by CEO Matt Murphy since he took over in 2016, Marvell has built a portfolio of market-leading products and IP across computing, networking, security, electro-optics, and storage. Consequently, the company is a critical partner for hyperscale cloud service provider, data center, enterprise networking, carrier infrastructure, consumer, and automotive/industrial end-market customers. Marvell is targeting 15% to 20% average revenue growth through the semiconductor cycle in the coming years, largely driven by secular trends and company-specific product innovations within the cloud, 5G, and automotive end markets. We believe Marvell can deliver on or exceed this target because, among other growth opportunities, its market-leading optical products are critical to delivering increasing data transmission speeds required by hyperscale customers in AI training and inference. At the same time, the company is simultaneously ramping up a custom silicon business working directly with hyperscale partners. Given the dislocation in the stock on near-term cyclical concerns, we believe we paid an attractive price for the long-term growth of this industry-leading company.”08. Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK)Price Reaction after the Upgrade: +0.23 (+0.26%)On August 18, Zelman &amp; Associates, a highly regarded firm known for its expert stock analysis, made a pivotal adjustment in their assessment of Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK). In their latest report, the firm upgraded its rating from ""hold"" to ""buy,"" marking a notable shift in their outlook on Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) trajectory. The transition from a ""hold"" rating, which typically signifies a more cautious stance, to a ""buy"" rating, which implies confidence in the company's performance, underscores the firm's belief in the company's ability to seize opportunities and enhance shareholder value.Appleseed Fund made the following comment about Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“During the most recent quarter, Appleseed Fund added three new equity holdings: Medtronic (MDT), Stanley Black &amp; Decker, Inc. (NYSE:SWK), and Synovus Financial (SNV). Stanley Black &amp; Decker is the world’s largest tool manufacturer. It produces power tools, hand tools, storage, digital tool solutions, lifestyle products, outdoor products, engineered fasteners, and other industrial equipment. 2022 was quite a forgettable year for the Company with its stock price falling by roughly 60%. Due to supply chain issues, bloated inventories, inflationary pressures, and weaker demand, the Company badly missed its original 2022 guidance. With recessionary fears, waning earnings momentum, a more elevated leverage profile, and reliance on the U.S. construction market, it is of no surprise how poorly the stock price behaved last year. In our view, the sell-off has been excessive with the stock price trading near March 2020 pandemic lows and at levels otherwise not seen since early 2014. We view the stock at washed-out levels with a favorable profile going forward.”07. Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL)Price Reaction after the Upgrade: +0.49 (+0.44%)In a notable move on August 18, Morgan Stanley upgraded Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) rating from ""Underweight"" to ""Equalweight,"" signifying a shift in their perspective on the company's stock. This shift was motivated primarily by a reevaluation of the company's valuation. The decision to upgrade Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) rating from ""Underweight"" to ""Equal-weight"" reflects Morgan Stanley's revised view of the company's investment potential. ""Underweight"" often suggests that a company's stock is perceived as less favorable or promising than other investment options. On the other hand, the upgrade to ""Equal-weight"" suggests that Morgan Stanley now considers Globe Life's stock to be on more even ground in terms of investment attractiveness.Morgan Stanley's rationale for this upgrade primarily revolves around valuation considerations. Valuation is crucial in determining a stock's attractiveness as an investment opportunity. By revisiting their valuation models and considering various market factors, Morgan Stanley likely concluded that Globe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) stock had become more fairly valued or potentially undervalued than their previous assessment. In conjunction with the upgrade, Morgan Stanley also assigned a price target of $131 for Globe Life's stock. This price target represents Morgan Stanley's projection for where the stock price could reach within a specific timeframe. The fact that Morgan Stanley has attached a price target to their assessment underscores their confidence in their upgraded perspective and provides investors with a quantitative benchmark to consider.06. Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR)Price Reaction after the Upgrade: +0.50 (+1.15%)On August 18, Guggenheim analyst Shahriar Pourreza upgraded Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) rating from ""Neutral"" to ""Buy,"" signifying a substantial shift in their perspective on the stock's potential. Shahriar Pourreza's decision to upgrade Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) rating from ""Neutral"" to ""Buy"" indicates that Guggenheim now views the company's stock as a more attractive investment option. The transition from a ""Neutral"" rating, which suggests a relatively balanced view, to a ""Buy"" rating implies Guggenheim's confidence in the company's ability to deliver favorable returns and capitalize on opportunities. Guggenheim has also set a price target of $48 for Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) stock in conjunction with the upgrade. This price target is a quantitative projection of where Guggenheim believes the stock's price could reach. Click to continue reading and see the 5 Stocks Getting a Huge Vote of Confidence From Wall Street Analysts. Suggested articles:12 Stocks That Will Benefit From AI20 Biggest Internet of Things Companies in the World10 Industries Being Revolutionized By AI and Automation TechnologiesDisclosure: None. 10 Stocks Getting a Huge Vote of Confidence From Wall Street Analysts. is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

And if that's the case, the Nvidia hype balloon may pop.""Nvidia expectations have been steadily moving higher in recent weeks, and the investor debate appears centered on supply rather than demand,"" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy pointed out in a new client note on Tuesday.Roy added that supply concerns and its near-term impact on Nvidia's guidance are ""top of mind.""Nvidia is viewed as boasting the pole position in the AI space due to its H100 chips that power OpenAI's ChatGPT platform and other budding tech applications. The company has also inked high-profile generative AI chip deals with ServiceNow (NOW) and Snowflake (SNOW).The strong demand triggered a material upward reset in Nvidia's guidance on May 24. Nvidia said it expects second quarter revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was anticipating $7.2 billion.Nvidia's market cap exploded by $184 billion the next day as investors raced to get a piece of a rapid growth story.A sign is posted in front of the Nvidia headquarters on May 10, 2018, in Santa Clara, California. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)Nvidia's shocking May outlook has Wall Street bracing for big, positive guidance from the company when it reports earnings on Aug. 23.HSBC, KeyBanc, and BMO Capital Markets are the latest investment banks to raise their price targets on Nvidia into second quarter results. And Wells Fargo, Baird, and Morgan Stanley got the pre-earnings excitement going with bullish notes of their own last week, Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reported.""Last quarter's guidance was pretty astonishing,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""I had to look at the number twice. I couldn't register it in my brain, and I've been doing this job a fairly long time. I've never seen a guide like that from an established, at-scale company like we saw. So that was pretty unbelievable.""Story continuesNvidia stock is up 15% in the last week alone, bringing the year-to-date gain to 221%.But chip supply uncertainty must at least be acknowledged by the Nvidia bulls, as it's very real.VentureBeat reported that power players in tech such as Oracle (ORCL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) may want hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's H100 chips. The insatiable demand for the chips is spurring shortage fears in Silicon Valley, and possibly limiting Nvidia's top line in the near-term.""Who’s getting how many H100s and when is top gossip of the valley [right now],"" posted tech insider and top data scientist Andrej Karpathy on X, formerly known as Twitter, earlier this month.Nvidia bull Rasgon acknowledged the problem as a top risk too.""Supply is very limited, so customers can't get what they want,"" Rasgon explained. ""And there's a general behavior that happens in semiconductors and lots of other places, it's called double ordering. When people can't get what they want, they order more.""""And with Nvidia, that's one of the primary controversies is this new level of demand that we see, is that sort of the new baseline for growth? Or is it like pull forward and panic buying and is there an air pocket?"" Rasgon continued. ""And look, at some point, what is the chance that Nvidia will see an air pocket? It's probably 100%.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell's speech at the meeting will grab the spotlight on Friday.Story continuesTraders' bets of a pause in rate hikes next month stand at 86.5%, while odds of a 25 basis point rate hike in November have risen to nearly 39% from about 35.8% a week ago, according to CME Group's FedWatch tool.Quarterly results from a number of consumer goods makers were also in focus on Tuesday. Lowe's Cos rose 3.2% after the home improvement retailer topped quarterly profit estimates.Macy's jumped 4% after the department store chain beat second-quarter sales estimates, while Coty slipped 2.0% after the perfume and cosmetics maker forecast annual profit below Wall Street expectations.At 7:08 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 66 points, or 0.19%, S&amp;P 500 e-minis were up 17.25 points, or 0.39%, and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 79 points, or 0.53%.Among other stocks, shares of Zoom Video Communications rose 2.8% in premarket trading after the video-conferencing platform forecast third-quarter profit above Wall Street estimates.Activision Blizzard gained 1.3% after Microsoft offered to sell the ""Call of Duty"" maker's non-European streaming rights to Ubisoft Entertainment to get the deal past British regulators.(Reporting by Amruta Khandekar and Shristi Achar A; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)]"

VEEV has been gaining from its strong product portfolio. The optimism led by a solid first-quarter fiscal 2024 performance and strong product adoption are expected to contribute further. Stiff competition and forex volatility persist.Over the past year, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has lost 12.7% against 7.9% growth of the industry and a 6% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned provider of cloud-based software applications and data solutions for the life sciences industry has a market capitalization of $29.96 billion. The company projects 20.3% growth for the next five years and expects to maintain its strong performance. It has delivered an earnings surprise of 8.3% for the past four quarters, on average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s delve deeper.Strong Product Portfolio: We are optimistic about Veeva Systems’ unique solutions, which include Veeva Vault, Veeva CRM (customer relationship management), Veeva Network and Veeva OpenData. In June, the company announced the expansion of its business consulting services to help life sciences organizations achieve greater speed and efficiency across the product development lifecycle.In May, Veeva Systems announced the availability of Veeva Link MedTech.Product Adoption: We are upbeat about Veeva Systems registering a robust adoption for its products over the past few months. In July, the company announced that Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany, is using Veeva Vault MedInquiry as its global medical information management system.In May, Veeva Systems announced that Lotus Clinical Research expanded its partnership with Veeva Systems and broadened its adoption of Veeva Vault Clinical Suite to strengthen its service delivery and efficiency.Strong Q1 Results: Veeva Systems’ solid first-quarter fiscal 2024 results buoy optimism. The company saw an uptick in the overall top line and robust performances by both segments. The company continued to benefit from its flagship Vault platform. Veeva Systems’ continued strength in its Commercial Solutions, with new small-sized to mid-sized customer additions and expansions in Veeva Commercial Cloud, were also seen.Story continuesDownsidesForex Volatility: Veeva Systems derives a major share of its revenues from international operations. Some of its international agreements provide payment denominated in local currencies and the majority of its local costs are also denominated in local currencies. Fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar versus foreign currencies may impact its operating results when converted into U.S. dollars.Stiff Competition: Veeva Systems operates in a highly competitive market. In new sales cycles within the company’s largest product categories, it competes with other cloud-based solutions from providers that make applications for the life sciences industry. The company’s Commercial Cloud and Veeva Vault application suites also compete to replace client-server-based legacy solutions offered by large companies and other smaller application providers.Estimate TrendVeeva Systems is witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for fiscal 2024. In the past 90 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for its earnings has moved 5.8% north to $4.57.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s second-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $581.8 million, suggesting an 8.9% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.Other Key PicksA few other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Patterson Companies, Inc.

Lower consumer spending due to inflationary pressures in Europe and a slow recovery in China are impacting demand.Industry players like Air Products and Chemicals, Inc. APD, DuPont de Nemours, Inc. DD and Albemarle Corporation ALB are banking on strategic measures, including operating cost reductions and aggressive price hikes to tide over the challenging environment.About the IndustryThe Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry consists of manufacturers of basic chemicals, plastics, specialty chemicals and agricultural chemicals. Companies in this space serve a host of end markets, such as automotive, building &amp; construction, transportation, electronics, aerospace and agriculture. Basic chemicals are produced in large quantities, and include petrochemicals and intermediates (such as ethylene, propylene and benzene), polymers (including plastic resins such as polyethylene, polypropylene and polyvinyl chloride), and inorganic chemicals (such as chlorine, caustic soda and titanium dioxide). Specialty chemicals that include catalysts, specialty polymers and coating additives are used in specific fields based on their performance. Agricultural chemicals include herbicides, fungicides and insecticides that are used to protect crops from disease, pests and weeds.What's Shaping the Future of the Chemicals Diversified Industry?Demand Headwinds From End-market Weakness: Companies in the chemical-diversified space are facing headwinds from a slowdown in certain key markets. The sluggishness in the building &amp; construction market and the destocking in consumer electronics are key concerns. In North America, uncertainties surrounding the U.S. housing market are weighing on building &amp; construction. Softer demand in industrial and consumer durables is hurting chemical volumes. Weaker global economic activities have led to a higher level of uncertainties, which may affect chemical volumes over the near term.Slowdown in Europe and China a Worry: A slower recovery in economic activities in China following the lifting of the restrictions related to the resurgence in COVID-19 infections is hurting chemical demand in that country. Global industrial activities have been affected by the weaker demand recovery in China. The slowdown in Europe resulting from the war in Ukraine and weaker consumer spending due to high levels of inflation has also led to softer demand in that region. The energy and feedstock inflation has resulted in reduced industrial production and consumer spending in Europe. The ongoing weakness in these key regions is likely to impact demand for chemicals over the short haul.Strategic Actions to Aid Results: The companies in this space are taking a host of strategic measures, including cost-cutting and productivity improvement, operational efficiency improvement and actions to strengthen the balance sheet and boost cash flows. In particular, the industry participants are aggressively implementing actions to bring down costs. These include the reduction of discretionary spending. The industry players are also raising selling prices to counter raw material and logistics cost inflation. Such moves are likely to help the industry sustain margins amid the prevailing challenges.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bleak ProspectsThe Zacks Chemicals Diversified industry is part of the broader Zacks Basic Materials sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #239, which places it at the bottom 3% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates gloomy near-term prospects.

253,85e2913f-5d1b-32bc-ae83-81ce72215245,APD,2023-08-22,3 Hydrogen Stocks to Buy That Pay Dividends,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-hydrogen-stocks-buy-pay-212855317.html,1692134935,STORY,"['BP', 'APD']","[Are you after a list of hydrogen stocks that pay dividends? Look no further. This article details the best hydrogen stocks to buy that also have healthy dividend yields. This may give you the best of both worlds, in terms of income as well as a potentially high total return.Hydrogen has emerged as an important alternate energy source. As the world transitions from thermal coal burning, many look to alternatives like natural gas. The issue with natural gas, however, is that this is still natural gas. As such, it is an intermediary step toward meeting the world’s energy needs, not a long-term solution. Although it burns much cleaner than coal, it still releases enough pollutants into the atmosphere for it to be problematic.If we are to achieve true carbon neutrality, then cleaner sources such as hydrogen must be investigated more deeply. Here are the best hydrogen stocks that pay dividends, in my opinion, to help you take advantage of the world’s energy shift.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFortescue Metals Group (FSUGY)A pile of iron ore granules on a black background.Source: ShutterstockFortescue Metal Group (OTCMKTS:FSUGY) is one of those top hydrogen stocks that pay dividends and should be on your watchlist. Traditionally an iron ore producer, the group is transforming its business to produce green hydrogen and aims to fully decarbonize operations by 2030.A big bonus of investing in this company is that its dividend yield is very high, around 9% at the time of writing. Dividends are incredibly important to an investor’s total returns. Although they have been incorrectly dismissed by the Dividend Irrelevance Theory, more and more people are looking to hydrogen companies like FSUGY stock to diversify their portfolios.Management realizes, in the age of ESG investing and the world’s rising urgency to reduce emissions, the world will need iron ore as much as it needs cleaner energy sources. This means that one can potentially reap the rewards of investing in both materials through an energy stock like FSUGY and benefit from its high income in turn.Story continuesAir Products &amp; Chemicals (APD)Air Products (APD) logo on the Arts Quest building, Air Products is a sponsor of Air Products Town Square at Arts Quest in Bethlehem, PASource: Andy Borysowski / Shutterstock.comAir Products &amp; Chemicals (NYSE:APD) is one of the world leaders in supplying industrial gases and a global leader in liquefied natural gas (LNG) processing technology. It’s also one of the world’s largest suppliers of merchant hydrogen. Air Products’ extensive hydrogen infrastructure and ongoing projects, such as the $7 billion carbon-free hydrogen joint venture in Saudi Arabia, position it as a leading global hydrogen energy company.APD stock’s dividend yield is a healthy 2.4% in addition to being well-covered by its free cash flow. Part of what makes APD stock a good pick from a income point of view is that its gross, operating, and net profit margins are all positive. This is a big difference to some of the most speculative hydrogen-based businesses today. Wall Street also predicts it may have strong total return potential, as its target price is $330 at the time of writing.The company’s forward P/E of 22.85 times earnings is lower than its current P/E of 29.72, indicating the market is bullish on its prospects for the immediate future.BP (BP)The BP (BP) logo on a sign against a blue sky with cloudsSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comBP (NYSE:BP) is a global oil and gas producer with ambitions to transition to lower-carbon energy. Hydrogen is a crucial aspect of its strategy, and BP intends to capture a significant share of the hydrogen market in its core operating areas. It’s one of those key hydrogen stocks that pay dividends you should watch closely.BP’s move into hydrogen production, including plans for the U.K.’s largest blue hydrogen production plant, represents a significant shift from its traditional oil and gas business.One of the great things about energy stocks is that they’re known for paying out juicy dividends. BP is no exception. Its yield is an impressive 4.8%. With a payout ratio of just 26%, it’s very well-covered by the company’s cash flow strength.The brand is also making strides in research and development. BP Ventures has invested in start-up Advanced Ionics to reduce zero-carbon hydrogen production costs. Utilizing heat from existing operations, Advanced Ionics’ technology aims to lower electricity consumption and bring the cost of green hydrogen to less than $1 per kilogram, aligning with BP’s goal to produce up to 0.7 million tonnes of green hydrogen by 2030.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of current TV viewing data and global content trends then head straight to the 6 Countries That Watch the Most TV.Recent TV Viewing Data and Global Content TrendsThe TV landscape is witnessing a significant shift, driven by fragmented offerings and the surge in non-linear viewing. As stakeholders adapt their strategies, a consistent focus on fiction in program launches persists. Glance's insights underscore two pivotal trends: the growing prominence of series as IPs and the sustained popularity of older entertainment formats.TV broadcasters are strategically expanding to multiple platforms to cater to the rising demand for non-linear viewing, with ITV's ""Unforgotten"" capturing a substantial audience in 2023. Despite this, the challenge lies in devising effective monetization models amidst content and strategy investments. Concurrently, public broadcasters collaborate and invest in top-tier dramas to stay competitive. However, despite the proliferation of FAST Channels, their viewership remains relatively modest compared to live broadcasts, calling for standardized audience measurement, even as SVOD platforms like Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Prime Video, Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)’s Disney+ transition to advertising. Amidst these dynamic changes, ""coopetition"" emerges as a novel strategy for successful content launch and development, reinforcing industry resilience with stable market shares. In 2022, global TV viewers averaged 2 hours 25 minutes daily, varying across 88 countries.Interestingly, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Prime Video and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)’s Disney+ are reportedly exploring the transition to an ad-supported model for their streaming platforms. This entails introducing a more budget-friendly subscription tier with advertisements, allowing users to cut down on subscription costs. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)’s Disney+ have already introduced ad-supported plans in the past year, and if Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s Prime Video follows suit, all major streaming services would offer ad-supported options. For Netflix, the choice to incorporate advertisements followed a period of subscriber loss in the initial quarter of 2022, although its subscriber numbers recovered later in the year. And Walt Disney Co (NYSE:DIS)’s Disney+ introduced ad-supported plans for affordability and higher user revenue in late 2022.Story continuesNotably, these ad-supported tiers would be supplementary to their existing ad-free subscription choices. The shift towards ad-supported streaming is driven by the aim to generate additional revenue from entertainment and tap into the migration of advertising funds from traditional television to streaming platforms, while also enticing more subscribers to their video services.Furthermore, recent data indicates a decline in TV viewership from traditional broadcasters. Time spent watching TV shows on traditional channels, including live, recorded, and on-demand content, dropped by 9% compared to 2020 and 4% compared to 2019. This decline indicates an ongoing trend of reduced viewership from traditional broadcasters over the past decade. The share of viewership held by broadcasters also decreased to 59% in 2021, down from 61% in 2020 and 67% in 2019.Amid TV viewership changes, the question remains: Do Americans watch more TV than other countries? According to a study conducted in 2021, television consumption in the United States stands out. After accounting for sleeping hours, Americans dedicated a significant portion of their time to watching television, averaging around 3.35 hours per day. Now, if you’re curious to know which countries watch the most TV, continue reading to uncover the answer in our final segment.20 Countries That Watch the Most TVConcept Photo/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyFor our list of 20 countries that watch the most TV, we gathered data from reputable sources to obtain information on the average daily TV viewing time for each country.

Germany Average daily TV viewing time: 2.43 hoursIn Germany, people still spend a lot of time with old-fashioned media, like TV, making up 52.5% of their media time. This shows that even though digital media is getting more popular, regular TV is still a big part of how Germans enjoy media. Although they might watch TV a bit less than in some other countries, it's still an important way they enjoy media in Germany.19. South Korea Average daily TV viewing time: 2.46 hoursTV watching in South Korea is changing, with less TV and more digital media. People love dramas, reality shows, and comedy on TV there. Korean dramas are a hit not only in South Korea but also in other Asian countries and beyond. They've even become popular worldwide with translated versions on tapes, DVDs, and digital formats.18. Indonesia Average daily TV viewing time: 2.49 hoursIndonesians typically watch TV for about 2 hours and 49 minutes every day. But, they're getting more into digital media these days. Out of the 283 hours they spend on digital media in a month, more than half (55 percent) is spent on things like news, websites, OTT, and music streaming.17. Ireland Average daily TV viewing time: 2.50 hours People in Ireland typically watch TV for around 2 hours and 50 minutes every day. The preferred TV channels in Ireland are RTÉ One, RTÉ Two, Virgin Media One, and Virgin Media Two. These channels offer a variety of shows, including news, entertainment, and sports programs.16. Australia Average daily TV viewing time: 2.52In Australia, baby boomers spent about 18 hours per week watching free-to-air TV, while millennials watched an average of 10 hours weekly. News channels continue to be popular, with 38% of respondents relying on them for news in 2023. This underscores that TV remains a significant news source in Australia.15. France Average daily TV viewing time: 2.53 hours Around 27% of viewers in France watched 10 or more TV show episodes weekly. TV advertising spending in France reached approximately 3.4 billion euros in 2022. Top TV channels in France encompass TF1, France 2, France 3, and M6. Engrenages, Les Revenants, and Dix Pour Cent stand out as notable French TV dramas.14. United Kingdom Average daily TV viewing time: 2.55 hours The emergence of streaming platforms has greatly affected traditional TV channels in the UK, leading to a decrease in live TV watching and ad earnings. WARC's report predicts a 3.1% drop in worldwide TV advertising revenue in 2023, largely due to the impact of streaming services. According to Ofcom's findings, live TV viewing in the UK dropped by 13% in 2021. As traditional TV consumption declines, streaming services are gaining more traction and popularity in the UK.13. Turkey Average daily TV viewing time: 2.58 hoursTurkish television audiences exhibit a pronounced fondness for TV series, leading to substantial economic, industrial, and artistic advancements within Turkey's TV series sector since the early 2000s. These Turkish TV series, referred to as ""diziler,"" have garnered significant attention both domestically and on the global stage. However, there has been a consistent decrease in overall television consumption within Turkey, a trend attributed to the evolving media landscape and the ascent of online media platforms. Despite this decline, television remains the primary source of news for the majority in Turkey, even as traditional print newspapers have waned in popularity. This enduring dominance of television as a news medium is propelled by effective governmental regulation and the convenience of accessibility.12. Italy Average daily TV viewing time: 2.59 hoursMost Italians aged 16 to 75 like watching TV in the evening, from 9 pm to 11 pm, with 46.6% choosing this time. When it comes to how they watch TV, the top choices for Italians are regular TV channels (57%), then streaming services (23%), and pay-TV channels (20%).11. Japan Average daily TV viewing time: 3.0 hoursIn Japan, 58.4% of households that utilize a TV for internet access do it mainly to watch TV shows. A Magnite report suggests that the ad-supported streaming market in Japan will expand as conventional TV viewers adapt their viewing routines.10. Thailand Average daily TV viewing time: 3.01 hours Media going digital has altered how Thais watch, as they dedicate substantial time to the internet. Streaming services on over-the-top (OTT) platforms have become a hit in Thailand. Typically, viewers access OTT platforms about 17 days each month, spending around 3.1 hours daily.9. Argentina Average daily TV viewing time: 3.2 hours The way people watch TV in Argentina changed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with more viewers during that period. Additionally, there's a move towards subscription video-on-demand platforms, suggesting changing viewer preferences. The TV market in Argentina might shrink, possibly due to the growth of digital streaming platforms.8. Brazil Average daily TV viewing time: 3.04 hours A Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism report indicates that TV maintains its dominance in media spending in Brazil, yet it's facing competition from online media. The average daily watch time for broadcast linear programming in Brazil is 3 hours and 4 minutes. Concurrently, online viewing is gaining traction across a substantial portion of the population.

Ron DeSantis' appointees to a board that oversees Disney World's governing district on Monday launched a battle against the company on a new front — free passes and discounts for district employees.Board members of the Central Florida Tourism Oversight District submitted a complaint to the state Inspector General, claiming that the millions of dollars in season passes, as well as discounts on hotels, merchandise, food and beverages, that their Disney-supporting predecessors provided governing district employees amount to unethical benefits and perks.Last year alone, before the DeSantis appointees took over the governing board and it was still controlled by Disney backers, around $2.5 million in discounts and passes were given to district employees and their families, the board said in a news release.The arrangement was self-serving to the company because it funneled money back to Disney, with the district footing the bill, the release said.Disney didn't respond to an email seeking comment. A spokesman for the board didn't respond to a request for the letter sent to the Inspector General, which investigates fraud, mismanagement, waste and abuse.The arrangement appears to be more like an employee benefit rather than a taxpayer scam, similar to the way professors at a university may get free passes to athletic events or free tuition for family members, said Richard Foglesong, a Rollins College professor emeritus who wrote a definitive account of Disney World’s governance in his book “Married to the Mouse: Walt Disney World and Orlando.”The complaint from the DeSantis appointees comes as the district administrator they appointed last May faces an ethics dilemma of his own. Glen Gilzean, who earns $400,000 annually in his new job, also is chair of the Florida Commission on Ethics. He can't simultaneously be a commission board member and work for the district because the commission prohibits public employees from serving on its board, a commission attorney said last week in a legal opinion.Story continuesA fight between DeSantis and Disney began last year after the company, facing significant pressure internally and externally, publicly opposed a state law banning classroom lessons on sexual orientation and gender identity in early grades.As punishment, DeSantis took over the district through legislation passed by the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature and appointed a new board of supervisors to oversee municipal services for the sprawling theme parks and hotels. But the new supervisors’ authority over design and construction has been limited by the company’s agreements with Disney-supporting predecessors, which were signed before the new board took over.In response, Florida lawmakers passed legislation that repealed those agreements.Disney has sued DeSantis in federal court, claiming the governor violated the company’s free speech rights. The district has sued Disney in state court, seeking to nullify the agreements.___Follow Mike Schneider on Twitter at @MikeSchneiderAP]"

Yahoo Finance Reporter Alexandra Canal breaks down the WGA's report and what it means for the future of the industry.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: There's a new call for regulation in the streaming space. The Writers Guild of America has issued a new report calling Netflix, Amazon, and Disney the, quote, ""new gatekeepers"" of the media business and warns regulators to put a stop to consolidation in the industry. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has those details. Alexandra, what are you watching?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Hi, Rachelle, yes, a very fiery report from the Writers Guild of America late last week calling for the end of media consolidation. According to this report, as you just mentioned, Netflix, Amazon, Disney, some of the biggest behemoths in Hollywood right now-- they have so much market power, the WGA says, that they are dragging down wages. They're limiting viewer choice.But what really stuck out to me here was that warning about media consolidation, the WGA writing, quote, ""Any mergers in media and entertainment involving significant streaming players should be blocked, including acquisitions of smaller or potential competitors."" And this is something that has been potentially on the horizon for quite some time. Consolidation, which many executives have argued, is the name of the game.There are too many streaming services out there. I think you can see that by how we've seen a subscriber slowdown over the past year or so, those numbers slowing significantly. On top of that, companies have been struggling with profitability as streaming losses continue to be a problem. That's why we've seen more ad supported tiers. We've seen a wider crackdown on password sharing.So the expectation over the next five years is that we're going to see a lot less media players than we have today, which means the bigger guys who can afford it, which are your Apples, your Amazons on the world-- of the world, maybe potentially even Netflix-- they could gobble up some of those smaller players. And if that happens, the writers are going to feel the fallout there.Story continuesAnd that's what's really making these negotiations so complicated. The writers are not just negotiating for where the media environment is today. They're also trying to negotiate for where the media industry is heading. And there's a lot of question marks around that, especially surrounding AI, streaming residuals, and those are two issues that remain a critical component of these ongoing talks.RACHELLE AKUFFO: I mean, certainly, when you consider where traditional media was and where it is now with streamers, it makes sense. So then where does the talk stand today? And is there any end in sight?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Well, the good news is that they're still talking. The progression of those talks is still TBD. There aren't any formal deals being made at this point, but it does seem encouraging that both sides do want to make a deal at this point. Like I said, there's still some sticking points there.The writers-- they've been very adamant in their language. They're certainly going to hold off for a good deal. However, we are well past the 100-day mark. We're already seeing the ripple effect throughout the LA economy. Some of our favorite TV shows, movies-- they're being weighed to be pushed into 2024 or beyond.So we're entering this critical juncture when it comes to these talks. Hopefully, we can strike a deal soon. And I do think if the studios are able to negotiate a deal with the writers, the actors will soon follow. So it all comes down to these negotiations, but we're entering another week of talks, which is a positive.RACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. As long as the dialogue is still going on, at least that's something. Great stuff there. Our very own Allie Canal, thanks so much.]"

With 63% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 3.2% last week. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 26% for shareholders.

So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Walt Disney already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Walt Disney, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Walt Disney. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 8.1% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.7% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 4.0% of the company stock.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Walt DisneyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of The Walt Disney Company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$43m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 37% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Walt Disney   you should know about.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

""While our average total monthly customer bill is among the lowest in the nation, we understand families still want help managing energy bill costs during high-use days. The ComEd Energy Efficiency Program offers services, rebates and tips for families and individuals to reduce energy use now and in the future.""Energy-saving tips for warm-weather monthsFor the remaining warm-weather months of the year, the national award-winning ComEd Energy Efficiency Program offers tips to help families manage their energy use and save money on their electric bills:Clear area around cooling vents.Furniture, carpets, and other objects can block vents and prevent air from traveling. This blockage makes your cooling system work harder and prevents rooms from cooling down quickly.Use your windows to keep out heat.Close window coverings on the sides of your home where sunlight enters the most to prevent heat from getting in through your windows.Operate your thermostat efficiently.During the cooling season, set your thermostat to as high a temperature as possible while still maintaining personal comfort.If you're not home for more than 8 hours, consider turning up your thermostat 7 to 10 degrees.Overnight, consider turning up your thermostat 3 to 4 degrees while sleeping.Use fans and ventilation to cool your home.If you use air conditioning to cool your home, a ceiling fan allows you to raise the thermostat setting about 4°F with no reduction in comfort.Turn off ceiling fans when you leave the room. Remember that fans cool people, not rooms, by creating a wind chill effect.During the warmer-temperature months, set your fans counter-clockwise to push air towards the floor.Story continuesTo help customers track their energy use between bills, customers who create a free online account can sign up for High-Usage Alerts, that send notifications when energy use is trending higher than usual, and Weekly Usage Reports, that summarize your daily use so you can spot trends and adjust usage before your next bill arrives.For customers looking to take advantage of additional savings, ComEd offers free home energy assessments, which can improve the energy efficiency of a home and lower its energy costs, while enhancing the comfort of those who live within it. Each assessment features an energy advisor who collects information about a home's energy features by looking at its lighting, heating, and cooling systems, water heaters and appliances. Customers then receive free and discounted energy-saving products plus personalized recommendations for saving money and energy.By signing up for an assessment, customers can lower their energy costs and improve energy efficiency in their homes.

It may come over the next month or so but for now, we just appear to have seen crude move into a higher range between $80-$90.”The most-active October contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange settled down 48 cents, or 0.6%, at $79.64 per barrel — below the key $80 mark. WTI hit a session low of $79.47 earlier. The U.S. crude benchmark is down some 2% week-to-date, extending last week’s 2.3% slide after rallying nearly 20% over seven previous weeks.Brent settled down 43 cents, or 0.5%, at $84.03 per barrel. The global crude benchmark was down about 1% on the week, extending last week’s 3% drop after a seven-week rally that gave oil bulls an 18% return.The downside in crude has, however, been limited by data from oil cargo tracker Kpler that indicated a dramatic drop in crude exports from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and their allies in the first 15 days of August.The output cuts from the so-called OPEC+ alliance, led largely by the Saudis and Russians, could take away some 67.5 million barrels from the market over the next 45 days, energy markets advisory HFI Research said at the end of last week, summing up its own calculations of Kpler data.China’s economic woes weighBut some analysts said crude was expected to stay volatile through the week and possibly end lower on weaker technicals, combined with the “China-bear” story and expectations for a hawkish Fed at Jackson Hole.Story continuesChina's renewed economic weakness has raised questions over whether its oil demand can remain resilient.Investors will particularly be looking out for a speech this week by Fed Chair Jerome Powell on how the central bank envisages interest rates going forth.Jackson Hole could provide rates guidancePowell’s speech, set for 10:05 am ET on Friday, comes after last week’s minutes of the central bank’s July meeting showed that most policymakers are still concerned about upside risks to inflation, indicating that further rate hikes cannot be ruled out. For now though, traders on the money market see an 89% chance of the Fed holding rates at current levels at its September meeting, according to Investing.com's fed rate monitor tool.In Tuesday’s market, traders’ attention was also on forthcoming weekly data on U.S. oil stockpiles.API inventories dueThe American Petroleum Institute, or API, will release at approximately 16:30 ET (20:30 GMT) a snapshot of closing balances on U.S. crude, gasoline and distillates for the week Aug 18. The numbers serve as a precursor to official inventory data on the same due from the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Wednesday.For last week, analysts tracked by Investing.com expect the EIA to report a crude stockpile drop of 2.299 million barrels, versus the 5.96M barrel reduction reported during the week to Aug 11.On the gasoline inventory front, the consensus is for a build of 0.436M barrels over the 0.261M-barrel decline in the previous week. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.With distillate stockpiles, the expectation is for a climb of 0.095M barrels versus the prior week’s gain of 0.296M. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships and fuel for jets.(Additional reporting by Ambar Warrick in Singapore and Peter Nurse in London)Related ArticlesOil down 2nd day in row on China, Fed; U.S. stockpile data awaitedOil prices settle lower on nagging worries about Chinese demandU.S. crude stocks drop while distillates jump 2M barrels or more each - API]"

This led to the impressive second-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company registered growth in all divisions and all four categories.On a Base Business basis (non-GAAP basis), earnings were 77 cents per share, up 7% from the prior-year period. Net sales of $4,822 million increased 7.5% from the year-ago quarter. On an organic basis, the company’s sales advanced 8%, with improvements in all divisions and categories. This marked the 18th successive quarter of organic sales growth at or above its long-term target of 3-5% growth. The metric grew in all six divisions, with mid-single-digit or higher growth in each of its categories.CL’s gross margin expanded 80 basis points (bps) to 57.8% on GAAP and an adjusted basis, up from our estimate of 57.1%. This was mainly driven by continued strong pricing, and the benefits of funding growth and other productivity initiatives. For the rest of the year, the company expects top and bottom-line growth, with a gross profit margin expansion. For 2023, it foresees adjusted gross profit margin expansion and increased advertising investment.Driven by the impressive results, management raised its sales and profit forecast for 2023. It anticipates net sales growth of 5-8% compared with the prior stated 3-6%, in sync with our estimate of 5.7%. The current projection indicates gains from the acquisitions of pet food businesses, offset by a low-single-digit adverse currency impact.The company anticipates full-year organic sales growth between 5% and 7% compared with the earlier disclosed 4-6% and in line with our estimate of 7%. Management expects adjusted earnings per share to increase at the high-end of mid-single digits compared with the prior stated mid-single-digit growth, in line with our estimate of 5.9%.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) have gained 0.2% in the past six months compared with the industry’s growth of 5.2%.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research That said, let’s delve deeper into the factors driving the stock.Growth FactorsThe company’s innovation strategy is focused on growing in adjacent categories and product segments. Its innovation efforts are highlighted by the recent relaunch of the Soupline business in France and the launch of Suavitel — the Soupline Hearts. The company is on track with the relaunch of Sanex across Europe. Its Oral Care business has also been performing well, particularly in Africa.  Some other notable efforts include the continued expansion of the Naturals and Therapeutics divisions, as well as the Hello Products LLC buyout. The company partnered with Philips to introduce electric toothbrushes in Latin America, where the use of electric toothbrushes is low.  Also, its at-home whitening and professional whitening products bode well.CL is aggressively expanding into faster growth channels, while extending the geographic footprint of its brands. In 2019, the company expanded its portfolio by introducing pharmacy brands like elmex and meridol to newer markets. Colgate has been witnessing positive customer feedback for its elmex and meridol brands, driven by increased investment. The expansion of its premium skincare portfolio with the buyout of the Filorga skincare business also acts as a major growth driver.Also, Colgate’s Hill's business continues to witness sales momentum in the second quarter, with sales growth (22% of the total sales) of 16% from the year-ago quarter on a reported basis and 10.5% on an organic basis. Results gained from a 13.5% increase in pricing and volume growth of 4% on a reported basis, partly offset by a 3% decline in organic volume and a 1.5% adverse currency impact.Organic sales were aided by gains in the United States and Europe, partly offset by softness in Australia. The company’s newly launched Prescription Diet Derm Complete has been gaining market share and is likely to be rolled out internationally in the coming quarters. Colgate is also focused on expanding the availability of its products through the e-commerce channel, as more consumers are using online services for their essential needs.Headwinds to OvercomeDespite the gradual recovery in cost inflation, Colgate’s additional pricing increases are likely to affect volumes. The continued rise in raw and packaging material costs also acts as a deterrent. Nevertheless, countries like Turkey, Argentina and Pakistan continue to witness high inflation.The company anticipates a slightly heightened promotional environment in the back half of the year. Also, unfavorable currency continues to act as a headwind.Wrapping UpAlthough the aforementioned headwinds are likely to persist in the near term, product innovation, pricing efforts and expansion plans raise optimism in the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CL’s 2023 sales and earnings per share suggests year-over-year growth of 7.9% and 6.7%, respectively.The PEG ratio for Colgate is just 3.17, a level that is far lower than the industry average of 3.46. The PEG ratio is a modified PE ratio that takes into account the stock’s earnings growth rate. Clearly, CL is a solid choice on the value front from multiple angles. Topping it, a Growth Score of B and a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.4% reflect its inherent strength.Stocks to ConsiderWe have highlighted some better-ranked stocks from the broader Consumer Staples space, namely TreeHouse Foods THS, Associated British Foods ASBFY and Celsius Holdings CELH.TreeHouse Foods, a manufacturer of packaged foods and beverages, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). THS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 49.3%, on average.

The upgrades will help Viettel better scale its consumer mobile and fixed broadband services, especially as networking demands from its increasingly digitally-savvy populace increase, aligning with the government’s push to drive economic growth through technology.Vietnam is home to over 77 million internet users and is the fastest growing digital economy in Southeast Asia, owing to its booming e-commerce sector and increased adoption of digital services. Ranked as Vietnam’s most valuable brand and one of the Top 500 Most Valuable Brands in the World in 2022, Viettel has grown to become a global leader in telecommunications with over 70 million mobile subscribers worldwide. In Vietnam, the telco recently announced record growth, maintaining its market leader position with a 54% share of the mobile market and a 40% share of the fiber internet market.As the country advances its digital transformation program aimed at enhancing connectivity among its population, Viettel embarked on a transformative journey to foster the growth of Vietnam’s digital society.

And if that's the case, the Nvidia hype balloon may pop.""Nvidia expectations have been steadily moving higher in recent weeks, and the investor debate appears centered on supply rather than demand,"" Stifel analyst Ruben Roy pointed out in a new client note on Tuesday.Roy added that supply concerns and its near-term impact on Nvidia's guidance are ""top of mind.""Nvidia is viewed as boasting the pole position in the AI space due to its H100 chips that power OpenAI's ChatGPT platform and other budding tech applications. The company has also inked high-profile generative AI chip deals with ServiceNow (NOW) and Snowflake (SNOW).The strong demand triggered a material upward reset in Nvidia's guidance on May 24. Nvidia said it expects second quarter revenue to come in at about $11 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was anticipating $7.2 billion.Nvidia's market cap exploded by $184 billion the next day as investors raced to get a piece of a rapid growth story.A sign is posted in front of the Nvidia headquarters on May 10, 2018, in Santa Clara, California. (Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)Nvidia's shocking May outlook has Wall Street bracing for big, positive guidance from the company when it reports earnings on Aug. 23.HSBC, KeyBanc, and BMO Capital Markets are the latest investment banks to raise their price targets on Nvidia into second quarter results. And Wells Fargo, Baird, and Morgan Stanley got the pre-earnings excitement going with bullish notes of their own last week, Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley reported.""Last quarter's guidance was pretty astonishing,"" Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said on Yahoo Finance Live (video above). ""I had to look at the number twice. I couldn't register it in my brain, and I've been doing this job a fairly long time. I've never seen a guide like that from an established, at-scale company like we saw. So that was pretty unbelievable.""Story continuesNvidia stock is up 15% in the last week alone, bringing the year-to-date gain to 221%.But chip supply uncertainty must at least be acknowledged by the Nvidia bulls, as it's very real.VentureBeat reported that power players in tech such as Oracle (ORCL), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) may want hundreds of thousands of Nvidia's H100 chips. The insatiable demand for the chips is spurring shortage fears in Silicon Valley, and possibly limiting Nvidia's top line in the near-term.""Who’s getting how many H100s and when is top gossip of the valley [right now],"" posted tech insider and top data scientist Andrej Karpathy on X, formerly known as Twitter, earlier this month.Nvidia bull Rasgon acknowledged the problem as a top risk too.""Supply is very limited, so customers can't get what they want,"" Rasgon explained. ""And there's a general behavior that happens in semiconductors and lots of other places, it's called double ordering. When people can't get what they want, they order more.""""And with Nvidia, that's one of the primary controversies is this new level of demand that we see, is that sort of the new baseline for growth? Or is it like pull forward and panic buying and is there an air pocket?"" Rasgon continued. ""And look, at some point, what is the chance that Nvidia will see an air pocket? It's probably 100%.

285,bf622a17-db4e-37ae-8924-424932b0d765,AON,2023-08-22,Aon: U.S. Employer Health Care Costs Projected to Increase 8.5 Percent Next Year,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/aon-u-employer-health-care-120000301.html,1692705600,STORY,['AON'],"[CHICAGO, Aug. 22, 2023 /PRNewswire/ --  Average costs for U.S. employers that pay for their employees' health care will increase 8.5 percent* to more than $15,000 per employee in 2024, according to Aon plc (NYSE: AON), a leading global professional services firm.The projection increase, which assumes employers do not implement employee cost sharing increases and other cost saving strategies, is nearly double the 4.5 percent increase to health care budgets that employers experienced from 2022 to 2023. On average, the budgeted health care plan cost for clients is $13,906 per employee in 2023. The analysis uses the firm's Health Value Initiative database, which captures information for more than 800 U.S. employers representing approximately 5.6 million employees.Since the COVID-19 pandemic, employers are seeing medical claims experience return to typical levels of growth and should anticipate more inflationary cost pressures in the coming year.""While economy-wide inflation spiked during the past two years, employer-sponsored health care costs did not see dramatic increases during the same time period due to the multi-year nature of typical medical provider contracts,"" said Debbie Ashford, the North America chief actuary for Health Solutions at Aon. ""Even though inflation is subsiding, health care trend is growing as medical providers push insurers for larger cost increases to cover the higher costs of wages and supplies that they endured during the last couple years but were unable to pass on to payers.""""Other contributing factors adding pressure on health care cost trends are the proliferation of newly indicated weight loss drugs, new technologies, severity of catastrophic claims and increasing share of specialty drugs,"" Ashford added.In terms of 2023 health plans, employer costs increased 4.5 percent, while employee premiums from pay checks were slated to be a more modest 1.7 percent increase from 2022, according to Aon's analysis. Plan costs represent the employer's and employee's combined premiums for medical and prescription drug costs but exclude employee out-of-pocket payments such as deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance. On average, employers subsidize about 81 percent of the plan cost, while employees pay the remainder.Story continuesIncrease to U.S. Health Care Plan Costs from 2022 to 2023Plan Cost**20222023Change from 2022 to 2023Employer cost$10,736$11,224+4.5 %Employee premiums from pay checks$2,638$2,682+1.7 %Total plan cost$13,374$13,906+4.0 %""We see employers continuing to absorb most of the health care cost increases,"" said Farheen Dam, North American Health Solutions leader at Aon. ""In a tight labor market, plan sponsors are hesitant to shift significant cost to plan participants and make benefits less affordable.""Employees in 2023 are contributing about $4,675 for health care coverage, of which $2,682 is paid in the form of premiums from pay checks and $1,993 is paid through plan design features such as deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance, according to the firm's analysis.Employee Costs**20222023Change from 2022 to 2023Employee premiums from pay checks$2,638$2,682+1.7 %Employee out-of-pocket costs$1,886$1,993+5.7 %Total employee costs$4,524$4,675+3.3 %The rate of health care cost increases vary by industry, as does the proportion of cost shared by the plan, employer plan sponsor and employee. The professional services industry has the highest average employer cost increase at 7.5%, while the manufacturing industry has the highest average employee cost increase at 2.9%. The retail and wholesale industry has the lowest average change in employee contributions: a half percent decrease from 2022 to 2023.Increase by Industry to U.S. Health Care Plan Costs from 2022 to 2023IndustryEmployer CostEmployee Pay Check Contributions Total Plan CostHealth care3.2 %1.2 %2.8 %Manufacturing3.1 %2.9 %3.1 %Professional services7.5 %0.0 %5.7 %Public sector4.7 %1.7 %4.2 %Retail and wholesale trade3.5 %-0.5 %2.5 %Technology and communications5.0 %2.6 %4.5 %Improving Outcomes and Costs by Predicting and Addressing Complex Conditions""High-cost claimants are one of the largest drivers of health care expenses for employers, and this group of members is growing,"" Dam said. ""This growth is caused by several factors, including new high-cost injectable drugs, increasing cancer rates and longer hospital stays resulting from multiple conditions, complications and complex procedures. On the other hand, reinsurance premiums are climbing, making it harder for employers to hedge the elevated claim risk.""To help employers manage their health care spend and build a more resilient workforce, Aon developed its Health Risk Navigator, which provides predictive insights to anticipate and protect against the elevated risk employers face. The tool helps plan sponsors make better decisions to optimize reinsurance coverage, improve budget planning and implement targeted care management programs by using machine learning and risk simulation to analyze historical claims and demographic data for each individual employee, accurately predicting high-cost claim risks.Aon's Health Value InitiativeThe historical information and projections shown above were developed using Aon's Health Value Initiative database, which captures healthcare costs and benefit designs for more than 800 U.S. employers representing 5.6 million employees and $77 billion in 2023 health care spend. The projections above are developed after taking plan design changes as well as demographic and geographic population adjustments into account. To learn more about Aon's Health Solutions, visit https://www.aon.com/home/solutions/health.* The projection is applicable in a status quo environment when employers do not make changes or implement care management programs. Aon consultants expect many employers to implement cost-saving changes or programs to help mitigate this increase. ** Based on the weighted average cost of clients in Aon's analysis in both 2022 and 2023.About AonAon plc (NYSE: AON) exists to shape decisions for the better — to protect and enrich the lives of people around the world.

RYAN.Industry: InsuranceLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2138164/5-insurance-brokerage-stocks-to-benefit-from-higher-demandBetter pricing, prudent underwriting, rising demand for insurance products and global expansion have been driving revenues of the Zacks  Insurance Brokerage industry players. The fast-paced consolidations in this traditionally fragmented industry are expected to benefit Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Aon plc, Brown and Brown, Erie Indemnity and Ryan Specialty Holdings, Inc.The increasing adoption of technology and higher spending on technology will help in the smooth functioning of the industry.About the IndustryThe Zacks Brokerage Insurance industry comprises companies that primarily offer insurance and reinsurance products and services. Insurance brokers act on behalf of their clients and offer advice, keeping in mind clients' interests against brokerage fees. Thus, their business is directly linked with clients' level of business activity. Some of these companies are also involved in providing risk management, third-party administration and managed healthcare services.Per a report by Allied Market Research, the global insurance brokerage market is projected to rise to $395 billion by 2027 or at an eight-year (2020-2027) CAGR of 7.3%. Research Dive estimates industry players combined to generate $515.3 billion in revenues by 2028, up at an eight-year (2021-2028) CAGR of 5.4%. Increased digitization has been helping to improve operational performance.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Insurance Brokerage IndustryIncreased Demand for Products to Drive Revenues: Industry players are continually expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products, while the rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance. Government initiatives should also add to the upside.Story continuesThe operational results of the industry players are affected directly by clients' level of business activity, which, in turn, depends on the extent of economic activity in the industries and markets they serve. Also, they must design products that are more appealing to customers.  This apart, better pricing ensures higher commissions for the industry players. Mergers and Acquisitions: The insurance brokerage industry is witnessing fast-paced consolidation. The industry has been traditionally fragmented, with a number of small players. One of the factors driving mergers and acquisitions is the companies' need to become specialized in their businesses. Some other factors driving M&amp;A are the interest shown by private equity firms in this sector, growing competition and lack of organic growth.Increased Adoption of Technology: To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others.These players are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate. Accelerated digitalization is also helping in curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. Increased digitization will help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and retention rate.While investments in technology help increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, players must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Insurance - Brokerage industry is housed within the broader Zacks Finance sector.

287,be4c2379-b1c0-34f8-8245-b4b409d2d05b,MCD,2023-08-22,Capital Investments At McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) Point To A Promising Future,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/capital-investments-mcdonalds-nyse-mcd-140034874.html,1692626434,STORY,['MCD'],"[If we want to find a potential multi-bagger, often there are underlying trends that can provide clues. One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. That's why when we briefly looked at McDonald's' (NYSE:MCD) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for McDonald's, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.24 = US$11b ÷ (US$50b - US$3.7b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, McDonald's has an ROCE of 24%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 9.6% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for McDonald's compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for McDonald's.The Trend Of ROCEWe'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like McDonald's. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 24% and the business has deployed 57% more capital into its operations. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.The Bottom Line On McDonald's' ROCEMcDonald's has demonstrated its proficiency by generating high returns on increasing amounts of capital employed, which we're thrilled about. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 97% return if they held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.Story continuesOn a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for McDonald's   you'll probably want to know about.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, includingApple Inc., NVIDIA Corp. and Bank of America Corp. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today's research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Apple shares have struggled lately, with the stock losing losing -11.6% of its value since the start of August, lagging the Zacks Tech sector's -7.3% decline and the S&amp;P 500 index's -4.6% pullback. This recent weakness notwithstanding, the stock has been a standout performer this year, handily outperforming the Tech sector as well as the broader market.The company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade, as well as the launch of its high-yield savings account with Apple Card, helped in driving subscriber growth.Apple's results also benefited from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption among enterprises. Apple expects iPhone and Services' year-over-year growth to accelerate in fiscal fourth-quarter as compared with the June quarter.However, revenues for both Mac and iPad are expected to decline by double digits on a year-over-year basis due to difficult comparison. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt top-line.(You can read the full research report on Apple here &gt;&gt;&gt;)As is the case with Apple, NVIDIA shares have struggled lately as well, with the stock lagging the Tech sector as well as the S&amp;P 500 index this month (-9.4% vs. -7.3% for the Tech sector &amp; -4.6% for the index). That said, Nvidia's performance this year is one for the record books, with the stock up +192.9% this year vs. +32.7% for the Tech sector and +15.2% for the market.Story continuesNvidia has literally been in a league of its own since its last quarterly release on May 24th when it raised guidance by a magnitude that we have never seen from another company. With the company on deck to report results on Wednesday, August 23rd, it is under the spotlight as to whether the preceding quarter's numbers were a one-off or the start of a sustained period of outperformance.The company is gaining from strong growth of artificial intelligence, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute &amp; Networking revenues.A surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of artificial intelligence-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds. Collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance its presence in autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space.However, NVDA's near-term prospects look gloomy due to weakening demand for chips used in gaming and professional visualization end markets. While macroeconomic headwinds are impacting gaming and professional visualization chip demand, higher channel inventory levels are hurting chip prices.(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Bank of America have underperformed the Zacks Banks - Major Regional industry over the past six months (-10.9% vs. -15.9%). The tough economic backdrop is expected to keep weighing on investment banking (IB) business. This, along with the volatile nature of the capital markets, might hurt non-interest income. Moreover, inflationary pressure will likely result in mounting expenses.Nevertheless, Higher interest rates and decent loan demand will likely keep aiding the company's net interest income (NII) growth.

NWL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NWLThe GF Value represents the current intrinsic value of a stock derived from GuruFocus' exclusive method. The GF Value Line on the summary page provides an overview of the fair value that the stock should trade at. This value is calculated based on historical multiples, GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future estimates of business performance. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. Conversely, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.Is Newell Brands a Hidden Value Trap? Unpacking the Risks and RewardsIdentifying Potential Value TrapsDespite its seemingly attractive valuation, certain risk factors associated with Newell Brands (NASDAQ:NWL) should not be ignored. These risks are primarily reflected through its low Altman Z-score of 0.69. These indicators suggest that Newell Brands, despite its apparent undervaluation, might be a potential value trap, underlining the importance of thorough due diligence in investment decision-making.Altman Z-Score: A Measure of Financial HealthThe Altman Z-score, invented by New York University Professor Edward I. Altman in 1968, is a financial model that predicts the probability of a company entering bankruptcy within a two-year time frame. The Altman Z-Score combines five different financial ratios, each weighted to create a final score. A score below 1.8 suggests a high likelihood of financial distress, while a score above 3 indicates a low risk.Story continuesA Snapshot of Newell BrandsNow, let's take a closer look at Newell Brands. An American global consumer goods company, Newell Brands operates through five segments: Commercial Solutions, Home Appliances, Home Solutions, Learning and Development, Outdoor and Recreation. The Learning and Development segment generates most of the revenue for the firm, offering products ranging from baby gear and infant care products to writing instruments and activity-based adhesive and cutting products.Is Newell Brands a Hidden Value Trap?

NWL 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of NWLUnraveling the Future of Newell Brands Inc: A Deep Dive into the GF ScoreDecoding the GF ScoreThe GF Score is a stock performance ranking system developed by GuruFocus using five aspects of valuation, which has been found to be closely correlated to the long-term performances of stocks by backtesting from 2006 to 2021. The stocks with a higher GF Score generally generate higher returns than those with a lower GF Score. Therefore, when picking stocks, investors should invest in companies with high GF Scores. The GF Score ranges from 0 to 100, with 100 as the highest rank.1. Financial strength rank: 4/102. Profitability rank: 6/103. Growth rank: 2/104. GF Value rank: 8/105. Momentum rank: 2/10Based on the above method, GuruFocus assigned Newell Brands Inc the GF Score of 64 out of 100, which signals poor future outperformance potential.Understanding Newell Brands Inc's BusinessNewell Brands Inc is an American global consumer goods company with a market cap of $4.28 billion and sales of $8.55 billion. The company operates through five segments: Commercial Solutions, Home Appliances, Home Solutions, Learning and Development, and Outdoor and Recreation. The Learning and Development segment, which offers baby gear, infant care products, writing instruments, art products, and labeling solutions, generates most of the firm's revenue. The company's operating margin stands at 4.83%.Story continuesUnraveling the Future of Newell Brands Inc: A Deep Dive into the GF ScoreFinancial Strength BreakdownNewell Brands Inc's financial strength indicators present some concerning insights about the company's balance sheet health. The company's interest coverage ratio of 1.56 positions it worse than 87.28% of 1352 companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. This ratio highlights potential challenges the company might face when handling its interest expenses on outstanding debt. The company's Altman Z-Score is just 0.69, which is below the distress zone of 1.81. This suggests that the company may face financial distress over the next few years. Additionally, the company's low cash-to-debt ratio at 0.05 indicates a struggle in handling existing debt levels. Furthermore, the company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio is 52.72, which is above Joel Tillinghast's warning level of 4 and is worse than 97.98% of 1334 companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry.Growth ProspectsA lack of significant growth is another area where Newell Brands Inc seems to falter, as evidenced by the company's low Growth rank. The company's revenue has declined by -0.4 per year over the past three years, which underperforms worse than 72.97% of 1713 companies in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry. Stagnating revenues may pose concerns in a fast-evolving market. Lastly, Newell Brands Inc predictability rank is just one star out of five, adding to investor uncertainty regarding revenue and earnings consistency.Unraveling the Future of Newell Brands Inc: A Deep Dive into the GF ScoreConclusionGiven the company's financial strength, profitability, and growth metrics, the GuruFocus Score Rating highlights the firm's unparalleled position for potential underperformance. While Newell Brands Inc has a rich history in the Consumer Packaged Goods industry, its current financial health and growth prospects may not be as promising.

However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Paccar (PCAR) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).Here are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this truck maker a great growth pick right now.Earnings GrowthArguably nothing is more important than earnings growth, as surging profit levels is what most investors are after. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for Paccar is 7.6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 48.5% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 12%.Cash Flow GrowthCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Paccar is 38%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 13.5%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 7.8% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 6.1%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.There have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Paccar. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 9% over the past month.Bottom LinePaccar has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that Paccar is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It also provides another paid holiday, ends forced overtime and adds air conditioning to new models of the company's ubiquitous brown trucks starting next year.An overwhelming 86.3% of voting members chose to ratify the agreement that covers UPS workers in the U.S., of which there are about 340,000, according to the International Brotherhood of Teamsters.""The agreement passed by the highest vote for a contract in the history of the Teamsters at UPS,"" the union said. The Teamsters did not say what percentage of members voted.General wage increases for part-time workers double the amount obtained in the previous UPS Teamsters contract - and existing part-time workers receive a 48% average total wage bump, addressing a key sticking point in talks, the union said.Under the contract deal, current full- and part-time workers will get $2.75 more per hour in 2023, and $7.50 more per hour over the length of the contract, according to the Teamsters.Ending seniority-based wage tiers that pay new hires less than veteran workers is also a central issue for the UAW-Detroit Three labor talks. UPS is the nation's largest private-sector employer of unionized workers and ending the labor cost-saving scheme there could be a big win for unions and a possible blow to companies.Meanwhile, Teamsters General President Sean M. O'Brien has made no secret of his plan to use the UPS deal as a recruiting tool - especially for warehouse workers at Amazon.com, the biggest customer at UPS.Story continues""Teamsters have set a new standard and raised the bar for pay, benefits, and working conditions in the package delivery industry. This is the template for how workers should be paid and protected nationwide, and nonunion companies like Amazon better pay attention,"" O'Brien said.Unions representing ""essential"" transportation workers including pilots, port workers and delivery drivers are enjoying enhanced bargaining power due to the tight labor market and stronger public support for unions.In July, pilots at UPS rival FedEx rejected their tentative contract.UPS cut its full-year revenue and profitability targets earlier this month, citing higher-than-expected labor costs and business lost during the tumultuous contract talks with the Teamsters.The company said all local supplemental agreements also have been ratified except one, which will be finalized shortly. Voting results for agreements covering UPS employees under locals 705 and 710 are expected soon.(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Priyamvada C in Bengaluru; Editing by Paul Simao and David Gregorio)]"

Ross, the call is yours.Ross Levinsohn: Thank you, Rob, and thanks to everyone for joining us here today. The Arena Group has come a long way over the last three years since I was asked to assume the role of CEO. And today, I'm thrilled to share with all of you the next phase of our evolution. Just after the market closed today, we announced that we have signed a binding letter of intent with Simplify Inventions to combine our assets with those of their subsidiary, Bridge Media Networks. Bridge Media Networks is a dynamic and innovative media group whose portfolio includes more than 100 owned and affiliated over-the-air television stations, two national television networks, cutting-edge streaming platforms and news, sports and programming distributed over 35 OTT, connected TV, MVPD and cable outlet.They also have a state-of-the-art production facility and operate two content verticals and travel through their brand TravelHost and automotive through their brand Driven. As part of this proposed transformative partnership and in addition to the strategic assets I just mentioned, The Arena Group will receive a $50 million cash investment and a five-year guaranteed advertising commitment of approximately $60 million from a group of consumer brands also owned by Simplify Inventions, including 5-hour ENERGY. We intend to use a portion of this cash to reduce our term debt held by B. Riley and B. Riley has agreed to extend the maturity of our remaining senior notes by three years at a fixed rate of 10%. That is a great outcome and a final solution for what has been an overhang of our company for the last several months.I'm truly grateful to Bryant Riley and the B. Riley team for working so closely with us on this deal and on this solution. They have been amazing partners for us and I couldn't ask for more. Not only is this partnership expected to strengthen our balance sheet, but it also allows us to dramatically broaden our reach, diversify our business and expand into some of the fastest-growing segments of the video market. As part of this transaction and subject to the final terms, completion of due diligence and shareholder approval and the receipt of any required regulatory approvals. We will merge the Bridge Media Networks 2 24-hour networks, NEWSnet and Sports News Highlights into The Arena Group as well as acquire their travel and automotive businesses, TravelHost and Driven, further expanding into two highly lucrative verticals.This transaction gives us a platform to create, distribute and monetize high-quality content from our iconic and premium brands in all forms, long form, trending news, social and now video. This capability is anticipated to deepen our relationships with advertisers, allowing us to create integrated sales and marketing packages across all platforms. I'm grateful for the entire team at Bridge Media Networks and 5-hour ENERGY and Simplify Inventions for their commitment to this incredible step forward for our businesses. Over the past three years, we have laid a strong foundation and have successfully revitalized iconic brands like Sports Illustrated, Parade, Men's Journal and TheStreet while accelerating upstart brands like FanNation, The Spun, Pet Helpful and HubPages.This transaction brings a diversified portfolio of assets to greatly enhance the proven business model that we've established. Together with Bridge Media, we are creating a vibrant multi-platform video vehicle that we expect will allow us to dramatically broaden our audience. We began our expansion into video when we acquired Fexy Studios late last year, and this transaction advances our video strategy by many years and accomplishes in a single transaction what we would have spent tens of millions of dollars and many years to develop on our own. The progress we have made in advancing our business model, including revenue growth, margin expansion and expense management made this transaction possible. With the capital infusion, debt extension and consolidation and a new experienced well-capitalized partner, The Arena Group is well positioned for further growth in the years ahead.During the quarter, we have continued to reap the benefits of our continued cost vigilance and operational discipline while allocating resources to our most promising growth opportunities. A few key highlights. Our total second quarter revenue increased by 9% to $58.8 million, driven largely by a 19% increase in digital advertising revenue. Despite a challenging ad market, our RPMs grew by 35% as compared to the prior year quarter. We continue to see premium digital monetization as compared to our competitors, as our second quarter programmatic CPMs were 41% higher, on average, than industry benchmarks according to STAQ benchmarking, a market-norm reporting service provided by Operative. Additionally, we began to see significant contribution from our revenue diversification efforts through e-commerce and video during the quarter.These strengths offset the impact of a decrease in monthly average page views in certain categories, according to Google Analytics. Our second quarter operating expenses decreased even as we grew revenue, a reflection of the headcount and cost reductions we have made throughout the year. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA was nearly breakeven, a loss of $76,000 as compared to a loss of $4.2 million in the prior year quarter, representing a significant improvement of $4.1 million even in a very tough environment. Our sports vertical, anchored by Sports Illustrated saw an overall 4% decrease in monthly average page views according to Google Analytics. The Spun, which focuses on breaking and trending news and sports, was somewhat impacted by Facebook and Google Search and Google Discover.However, this was partially offset by strong growth in our FanNation brand. And of note, earlier today, we received word from ComScore that the Sports Illustrated network, in the sports category, on ComScore finished at number two for the month of July, our highest ranking ever. We recently launched an F1 FanNation site, which eight months post launch is now the second largest F1 focus site according to data from ComScore and MRI-Simmons. Additionally, SI Golf rebranded from our acquisition of the Morning Read late last year saw a boost in traffic from breaking and trending news and in-depth LIV Golf and PGA Tour coverage. We anticipate strong growth in our sports vertical traffic through the remainder of the year as we kick off football season.Our 2023 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition launch, traffic broke every record more than doubling traffic versus last year. The announcement of the four covers, Martha Stewart, Megan Fox, Brooks Nader, and Kim Petras, guarded an amazing 108 billion median impressions over 13,500 articles written about the release according to data from ComScore and SimilarWeb. As we continue to evolve swim into a dynamic brand representing women's empowerment, we see growing interest from advertisers as we more than doubled the number of sponsors in this year's launch. We have also launched an SI Swimsuit Amazon storefront would deals on fashion, beauty and everything in between with promising early results. Our finance vertical, anchored by TheStreet had a record quarter with 38.2 million monthly average page views according to Google Analytics, an increase of 31% as compared to the prior year quarter and in May reached the top 10 business websites by traffic according to ComScore.In June, we launched our partnership with FundStrat Global Advisors and Tom Lee, expanding and diversifying the exclusive investing content that is offered in our subscription products. Also, in partnership with Tornado, TheStreet recently launched a first-of-its-kind app, TheStreet powered by Tornado, which provides users of all levels, a one-stop investing experience with personalized financial education and a comprehensive set of investing tools. April marked a year since we acquired Parade and the property continues to see strong growth in digital, with a 33% increase in monthly average page views as compared to the prior year quarter, according to Google Analytics. We are expanding our content base by adding new publishing partners covering entertainment and astrology.Men's Journal, which we acquired in December, recently announced our partnership with Club Random, a weekly podcast hosted by Bill Maher and featuring engaging conversations with guests like Ice Cube, Jon Hamm and John Mellencamp. We also added publishing partnerships in specialized topics such as sneakers, wine and streaming TV to broaden our editorial coverage at minimal upfront cost. The brand continues to resonate with consumers and advertisers as we continue to execute our playbook. Our adventure network sites, including Surfer, Powder and Bike Magazine, have dramatically increased their content acquisition and we recently signed an agreement to launch five new fast channels featuring these brands. More broadly, we continue to diversify our revenue streams across all of our verticals.If you are one of the millions of Galaxy device users, you may have seen new stories from Sports Illustrated, TheStreet and Parade across the new Samsung news app launched in April. We continue to seek new syndication partners for our content. We have seen extremely strong growth in our e-commerce business this quarter with second quarter revenue growing 240% year-over-year. We expect that this will continue to grow through the back half of the year, particularly as we head into the holiday season. Before we talk about next steps in our partnership with Bridge Media and our outlook for the remainder of the year, I'd like to let Doug Smith, our Chief Financial Officer, take you further through the numbers. Doug?Doug Smith: Thank you, Ross. Let me turn to the results. Revenue in the second quarter of 2023 was approximately $58.8 million, up 9% from $53.8 million for the second quarter of last year, reflecting very strong growth in our digital advertising, e-commerce and video businesses. Total digital revenue of $38.4 million represented nearly two-thirds of our total revenue and grew 10% versus the second quarter of last year. Digital advertising revenue increased 19% from $24.7 million in the prior year quarter to $29.3 million in this quarter. This growth was due to a 35% increase in revenue per page view, which more than offset our decline in travel. Digital subscription revenue of $3.4 million was down $2.1 million as compared to the $5.5 million in the prior year quarter as we continue to focus most of our resources on free ad or partner supported content.Licensing and Syndication revenue was $4.4 million, a decrease of just 1% as compared to the prior year quarter, which reflected sponsorships of the SI Swim launch that this year were extended into the third quarter as opposed to last year when they were all recognized around the launch. Total print advertising increased 9% to $20.4 million from $18.7 million in the prior year quarter, which reflects growth in the results of both Sports Illustrated and the Athlon Outdoor properties, which were acquired as part of the Parade Media acquisition in April of last year. Gross profit increased by 34% to $21.7 million compared to a gross profit of $16.1 million in the prior year quarter. That represents a seven percentage point increase in our gross margin to 37%.Driving this improvement was a year-over-year decrease in content and editorial costs of $1.4 million or 9% and a $4.6 million or 19% increase in digital advertising revenue. This reflects our continued efforts to manage costs and at the same time drive efficiency and growth. Total operating expenses decreased by $0.8 million or 2% to $36 million, down from $36.8 million in the prior year quarter. Selling and marketing costs increased by $2 million or 12%, primarily due to higher cost expenses related to branded content, which has grown as a percentage of our total direct ad campaign. General and administrative expenses, however, decreased by $3.1 million or 21%, primarily due to the impact of headcount reductions undertaken through the first half of the year.Non-operating expenses increased by $4.3 million, driven primarily by the increased interest expense of $2.5 million reflecting higher debt levels and an increase in income taxes of $1.8 million as we recognized a $1.7 million tax benefit in the second quarter of last year. As a result, net loss was $19.5 million as compared to $22.2 million in the prior year quarter, representing an improvement of $2.7 million or 12%. 2023 second quarter adjusted EBITDA was nearly breakeven or $76,000 loss as compared to a $4.2 million loss in the same quarter last year, representing a $4.1 million year-over-year improvement. Looking at liquidity, we ended the quarter with $5.5 million of cash and cash equivalents as compared to $13.9 million at December 31, 2020.In the first half of 2023, net cash used in operating activities was $16.4 million as compared to $7.5 million in the prior year period. We had $14.9 million borrowed under our $40 million line of credit, up slightly from the $14.1 million we had at the end of 2022. As Ross discussed, we've signed a binding letter of intent with Simplify Inventions to acquire certain assets of their subsidiary Bridge Media Networks. As part of the transaction, The Arena Group will receive $50 million cash investment, a five-year guaranteed advertising commitment of approximately $60 million from a group of brands also owned by Simplify, including 5-Hour ENERGY and the Bridge Media Networks operations. As consideration, Simplify will receive a $25 million of preferred stock at a 10% PIK coupon with a term of five years from the closing date and common equity, which will represent approximately 65% ownership of the combined company on a fully diluted basis at a $5 per share value.We intend to use this cash to reduce our term debt by $20 million from the approximately $102 million we currently have outstanding. And as Ross mentioned, B. Riley has also agreed to extend the maturity of the remaining debt from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2026, and at a fixed rate of only 10%. Due to the complex nature of this transaction, we're re-evaluating our full year guidance and will provide new estimates after the transaction has been closed and our businesses are being integrated. The transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2023. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Ross for closing comments.Ross Levinsohn: Thanks, Doug. Iconic brands, an innovative technology platform, strong partnerships with advertisers, a proven playbook for growth and now a well-capitalized balance sheet and an expansive video platform and opportunity. These are the things that The Arena Group will bring to the digital marketplace in the coming months and years ahead. We believe in the future of digital and connected video, we have always been an integral part of our strategic roadmap. This transaction launches us forward along that roadmap by many years. I believe we have found an ideal partner in Bridge Media, and I couldn't be more excited to be working with them going forward. Our discussions are ongoing and I look forward to sharing updates on our partnership as we have them.We expect the deal to close by the end of the year. And as Doug mentioned, we expect that it will take four to six months from now to fully integrate our businesses. While we execute on this transaction, we will not lose our focus on optimizing our existing business for the future. It is NFL and college football season by the way. We continue to remain vigilant about our cost base and at the same time are making carefully considered investments and capabilities that we believe will drive the future of our combined businesses. We have recently made several key hires to expand into partnerships with the vibrant creator and influencer space. We believe that together, brands and creators are a powerful force to connect consumers with the content they love.This is the core of our business and I look forward to sharing more with you on future earnings calls. Lastly, I want to thank our employees for their tireless work through very choppy orders in our industry. I want to thank our investors who have supported us through the last several years and thank our newest partners at Bridge Media Networks and their founder, Manoj Bhargava, whose commitment to our future and the future of media is substantial. We can't wait to get started. And with that I would love to answer any questions.

Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are up 4.1%, 13.8% and 27%, respectively. However, volatility has shown its ugly face once again in August owing to both internal and external factors.Consequently, month to date, the S&amp;P 500 Index is down 4.8%. Last week, the S&amp;P 500 fell 2.1%, marking its third-straight weekly loss, for the first time since February. The index’s last three-week loss of 4.6% is its biggest decline since the three weeks ended Mar 10.Nevertheless, the long-term trend of U.S. stock markets remains bullish. The inflation rate is dwindling steadily since June 2022. Fundamentals of the economy remain strong with a resilient labor market and solid consumer spending. These developments have brightened the chance of the Fed’s so-called “soft landing” and reduces the possibility of a near-term recession.At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in dividend-paying S&amp;P 500 stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that have provided positive returns in the past month with more upside left. If the index’s downturn continues, dividend will act as a regular income stream. If the benchmark resumes its northward journey, favorable Zacks Rank will capture the upsides.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five such stocks with strong potential for the rest of 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our pick sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCaterpillar Inc. CAT has seen year-over-year revenue and earnings growth for nine straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of supply-chain snarls and cost pressures. We expect CAT’s adjusted earnings per share for 2023 to grow 20% and revenues to rise 8%.Story continuesCaterpillar has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12% and 40.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.2% over the last seven days. CAT has a current dividend yield of 1.9%.Ross Stores Inc. ROST has benefited from positive customer response to its improved merchandise and strong value offerings. ROST has been benefiting from the execution of its store expansion plans over the years.ROST operates a chain of off-price retail apparel and home accessories stores, which target value-conscious men and women, aged 25 to 54 in middle-to-upper middle-class households. ROST has a proven business model as the competitive bargains it offers continue to make its stores attractive destinations for customers in all economic scenarios.Ross Stores has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.8% and 18.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.6% over the last seven days. ROST has a current dividend yield of 1.1%.PulteGroup Inc. PHM has been riding high since it reported solid second-quarter results. PHM’s solid operating model, which strategically aligns the production of build-to-order and quick-move-in homes with applicable demand across consumer groups, aided the result.Backed by its disciplined and balanced business model, PHM witnessed solid gross closings, orders and margins in the reported quarter and posted a 12-month return on equity of 32%. PHM expects to close 7,000-7,400 homes in the third quarter and 29,500 homes this year. PHM expects its community count to grow by 5-10% in the third and fourth quarters.PulteGroup has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.4% and 7.6%, respectively, for the current year.

ETN’s strategy to manufacture in the zone of sale has helped it to cut costs.Eaton has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 16.3%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last seven days. ETN has a current dividend yield of 1.6%.Pentair plc PNR anticipates volumes in the pool business to remain weak this year due to the ongoing inventory correction. However, the ongoing momentum in the Industrial and Flow Technologies and Water Solutions segments will offset the impact.Pricing actions, gains from the Manitowoc Ice acquisition and savings from the Transformation program are expected to offset the impacts of inflated costs and supply-chain issues on PNR’s margins. Focus on digital initiatives, innovation and acquisitions will aid growth. PNR’s Transformation Program is expected to drive margin expansion of at least 400 basis points by 2025.Pentair has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.3% and 1.6%, respectively, for the current year.

Investors will also be eyeing results from Macy's (M), Lowe's (LOW), Peloton (PTON), Gap (GPS), Toll Brothers (TOL), and Dollar Tree (DLTR). There is some key housing data on tap Tuesday and Wednesday. The big event of the week though is Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. Yahoo Finance Reporter Josh Schafer breaks down the events investors need to be watching this week.Video Transcript- Well, we have a solid week ahead of us with housing data, the Fed, big earnings. Here to break it all down for us, Yahoo Finance reporter, Josh Schafer. Hey, Josh.JOSH SCHAFER: Hey, Julie. Yeah. So we've got another fun week to close out our-- almost close out August for us. Here and right now, what I have next to me is the earnings schedule for this week. So you can see we're expecting Zoom today. We're going to have Dick's Sporting Goods and Lowe's later this week. Urban Outfitters, Macy's, Gap. Another look at that consumer.But the big one here, we gave it its own special day. I should mention companies like Peloton also report on Wednesday, but we did circle out Nvidia on purpose. This will be a key market driver to find out what we know more about in that artificial intelligence story. You remember Nvidia boosting its guidance last quarter, saying it expected revenue to grow about 50% more than it initially had. That sent the stock soaring. That sent really the stock market soaring and the NASDAQ soaring in that overall AI hype story.The street right now is expecting Nvidia to report about $11 billion in quarterly revenue. So we'll be closely tracking if they meet that number. Julian Emanuel, a strategist over Evercore, said that he thinks how Nvidia performs on Wednesday after the bell could tell us if stocks continue to head down for August or if we get a bounce back. So it seems like not just a report, Julie, for tech there but maybe a report that tells us about overall market sentiment depending on how it goes.Story continues- Yeah, for sure. Let's also talk eco data for the week because we got some stuff there to pay attention.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah. It's another fun week of eco data. And really, the big one here is on Friday. But when you take a look, we have existing home sales and some home data that we're going to be taking a look at this week. And then also be interesting to see if manufacturing PMI ticks back up closer to that 50 number.But you notice there's not a lot of the bigger stuff we normally talk about in terms of any look at inflation or labor, which is important to note because we have Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell speaking on Friday at Jackson Hole. Now some economists think that we won't get much of an indicator on what the Fed feels about rates for the September meeting and if they're going to move again because we don't have those key data points. We're going to have the labor report come next week. We're going to have another print on inflation also come next week.So I think what the large portion of the focus is going to be for this meeting is how Chair Powell feels about the overall resilient economy that we've been talking about for the last two months. Has it been too resilient, and does he come out and be more hawkish? There are some people sort of anticipating that. So the final thing I want to take a look at here is just the September expectations for if the Fed were to move or not.You can see here, right now, the market is pricing in a nearly 89% chance that the Fed does not move interest rates come September. This will be the chart I'm looking at Friday afternoon to see what happens to this chart right here after Chair Powell speaks. Do we see people more confident that the Fed will hold in September? Or is he overly hawkish, and maybe there's a little bit more movement here that people might expect a move on interest rates to come in September? That's something I'm excited for come Friday.- I mean, those move a lot. So we're definitely going to see something happen there.]"

Of course, one figure often stands out among the rest: earnings.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Medtronic (MDT) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.12 a share, just one day from its upcoming earnings release on August 22, 2023.MDT has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.11%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $1.12 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.11.MDT is just one of a large group of Medical stocks with a positive ESP figure. Vertex Pharmaceuticals (VRTX) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on October 26, 2023, Vertex Pharmaceuticals holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $3.94 a share 66 days from its next quarterly update.Story continuesFor Vertex Pharmaceuticals, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.93 is 0.21%.MDT and VRTX's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

322,c59e5ac2-cdc0-3c41-a7eb-08079fd8b6c6,VMC,2023-08-22,Vulcan Materials Company (NYSE:VMC) On An Uptrend: Could Fundamentals Be Driving The Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vulcan-materials-company-nyse-vmc-183546129.html,1692642946,STORY,['VMC'],"[Most readers would already know that Vulcan Materials' (NYSE:VMC) stock increased by 8.5% over the past three months. As most would know, long-term fundamentals have a strong correlation with market price movements, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Vulcan Materials'  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Vulcan Materials How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Vulcan Materials is:10% = US$736m ÷ US$7.2b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.10 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Vulcan Materials' Earnings Growth And 10% ROEAt first glance, Vulcan Materials seems to have a decent ROE. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 13%. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why Vulcan Materials saw little to no growth in the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Vulcan Materials' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 19% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for VMC? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Vulcan Materials Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 30% (implying that the company keeps 70% of its income) over the last three years, Vulcan Materials has seen a negligible amount of growth in earnings as we saw above. So there could be some other explanation in that regard. For instance, the company's business may be deteriorating.In addition, Vulcan Materials has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 20% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Vulcan Materials' payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 14%, over the same period.SummaryOverall, we feel that Vulcan Materials certainly does have some positive factors to consider. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

323,a3fbb7ed-1ca3-338d-8d9e-b5e5284dc0b3,GE,2023-08-22,General Electric Company's (NYSE:GE) institutional investors lost 3.1% over the past week but have profited from longer-term gains,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-electric-companys-nyse-ge-120027165.html,1692705627,STORY,['GE'],"[Key InsightsSignificantly high institutional ownership implies General Electric's stock price is sensitive to their trading actionsA total of 9 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Insiders have sold recently Every investor in General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 77% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$121b last week. Still, the 93% one-year gains may have helped mitigate their overall losses. They should, however, be mindful of further losses in the future.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of General Electric, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for General Electric ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About General Electric?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in General Electric. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at General Electric's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in General Electric. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company with 14% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.1% and 6.5% of the stock.Story continuesWe also observed that the top 9 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of General ElectricWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of General Electric Company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$306m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 23% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over General Electric. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 3 warning signs  with General Electric (at least 1 which is significant)  , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about General Electric (GE) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.GE currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.77, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 15 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.77 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 15 recommendations that derive the current ABR, eight are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 53.3% and 13.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for GEBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for GECheck price target &amp; stock forecast for GE here&gt;&gt;&gt;The ABR suggests buying GE, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is GE Worth Investing In?In terms of earnings estimate revisions for GE, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 15% over the past month to $2.27.Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for GE. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for GE may serve as a useful guide for investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of 29.03, the question arises: Is this stock fairly valued? To answer this, we delve into a comprehensive valuation analysis. We encourage you to read on to gain a deeper understanding of Valero Energy's intrinsic value.Company OverviewWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with CLX. Click here to check it out. VLO 30-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of VLOValero Energy Corp is one of the largest independent refiners in the United States. The company operates 15 refineries with a total throughput capacity of 3.2 million barrels a day in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Valero also owns 12 ethanol plants with capacity of 1.6 billion gallons of ethanol a year and holds a 50% stake in Diamond Green Diesel, which has capacity to produce 1.2 billion gallons per year of renewable diesel. With a current stock price of $130.66 and a GF Value of $133.96, Valero Energy appears to be fairly valued.Is Valero Energy Corp (VLO) Stock Fairly Valued?Understanding GF ValueThe GF Value is a proprietary measure of a stock's intrinsic value, computed considering historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor based on past performance and growth, and future business performance estimates. The GF Value Line denotes the stock's ideal fair trading value. If the stock price is significantly above the GF Value Line, it is overvalued and its future return is likely to be poor. On the other hand, if it is significantly below the GF Value Line, its future return will likely be higher.According to GuruFocus Value calculation, Valero Energy Corp (NYSE:VLO) appears to be fairly valued. The stock's current price of $130.66 per share and the market cap of $46.10 billion suggest that Valero Energy's stock is trading at its fair value. As Valero Energy is fairly valued, the long-term return of its stock is likely to be close to the rate of its business growth.Story continuesIs Valero Energy Corp (VLO) Stock Fairly Valued?Financial StrengthInvesting in companies with poor financial strength has a higher risk of permanent loss of capital. Thus, it is important to carefully review the financial strength of a company before deciding whether to buy its stock. Looking at the cash-to-debt ratio and interest coverage is a great starting point for understanding the financial strength of a company. Valero Energy has a cash-to-debt ratio of 0.45, which is worse than 53.05% of 1016 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. GuruFocus ranks the overall financial strength of Valero Energy at 8 out of 10, which indicates that the financial strength of Valero Energy is strong.Is Valero Energy Corp (VLO) Stock Fairly Valued?Profitability and GrowthInvesting in profitable companies carries less risk, especially in companies that have demonstrated consistent profitability over the long term. Typically, a company with high profit margins offers better performance potential than a company with low profit margins. Valero Energy has been profitable 9 years over the past 10 years. During the past 12 months, the company had revenues of $157.10 billion and Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $29.03. Its operating margin of 9.48% better than 51.24% of 968 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Overall, GuruFocus ranks Valero Energy's profitability as strong.Growth is probably one of the most important factors in the valuation of a company. GuruFocus' research has found that growth is closely correlated with the long-term performance of a company's stock. If a company's business is growing, the company usually creates value for its shareholders, especially if the growth is profitable. Likewise, if a company's revenue and earnings are declining, the value of the company will decrease. Valero Energy's 3-year average revenue growth rate is better than 69.64% of 853 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry. Valero Energy's 3-year average EBITDA growth rate is 45.7%, which ranks better than 81.36% of 826 companies in the Oil &amp; Gas industry.ROIC vs WACCOne can also evaluate a company's profitability by comparing its return on invested capital (ROIC) to its weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Return on invested capital (ROIC) measures how well a company generates cash flow relative to the capital it has invested in its business. The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. If the return on invested capital exceeds the weighted average cost of capital, the company is likely creating value for its shareholders. During the past 12 months, Valero Energy's ROIC is 28.86 while its WACC came in at 9.4.Is Valero Energy Corp (VLO) Stock Fairly Valued?ConclusionOverall, Valero Energy Corp (NYSE:VLO) stock appears to be fairly valued.

The new payout will be made on Sep 7 to its common shareholders of record on Aug 28.MUSA continues to display strength across all major categories, thanks to volume and market share gains in tobacco, to go with sales and contribution growth in non-tobacco categories. This positive backdrop, together with Murphy USA’s low-cost model, strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows, allowed the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) refining and marketing operator to reward investors with a dividend hike last week.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.While stock buyback continues to be MUSA’s preferred tool to distribute cash, the company’s policy dictates that it ploughs back around 4% of its capital in paying dividends. Agreed, the company’s current dividend yield is very low at less than 1%, but it is well protected with a payout ratio of just 6. As a result, the dividend not only looks quite sustainable but also leaves enough scope for future dividend increases. Investors should note that Murphy USA was one of the very few enterprises to actually initiate their first dividends during the coronavirus crisis of 2020 when countless others were being cut. (Check Murphy USA’s dividend history here)Murphy USA is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. The El Dorado, AR-based company, in its current form, came into existence following the 2013 spin-off of Murphy Oil Corporation’s downstream business into a separate, independent and publicly- traded entity. Murphy USA markets refined products through a chain of retail stations, almost all of which are located near a Walmart superstore, primarily in the Southeast, Southwest and Midwest United States.Story continues3 Energy Dividend Payers That Offer Better Yields Than MUSAIf you think Murphy USA’s dividend yield is too modest, here are some better choices.HF Sinclair Corporation DINO: A producer and marketer of gasoline, diesel fuel and other specialty products, HF Sinclair pays out a quarterly dividend of 45 cents ($1.80 annualized) per share that gives it a 3.12% yield at the current stock price.

328,088a88a3-f63c-35e2-b680-3ea92a0c4823,VLO,2023-08-22,The 7 Most Undervalued Energy Stocks to Buy Now: August 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-most-undervalued-energy-stocks-010926091.html,1692148166,STORY,"['PBF', 'DINO', 'VLO', 'MUSA', 'GPRK', 'MPC', 'SWN']","[While energy stocks have suffered amid the Federal Reserve’s efforts to contain inflation, the segment has witnessed a resurgence. According to a CNN report earlier this month, oil prices have jumped double-digit percentage points, helping to carry the broader sector northward.Some of the upswing could center on a recognition of core fundamentals. At the beginning of this year, analysts discussed the topic of energy stocks to buy now as a contrarian argument. Despite a lack of global supply, the sector inexplicably tumbled. Now, the market may be regaining some semblance of rationality.Another factor to consider is social normalization. For one thing, the revenge travel phenomenon continues to be robust this year, which supports the bullish case for undervalued energy stocks. Second, many companies are now cracking the whip hard regarding return-to-office directives. This should translate to increased hydrocarbon consumption, which then bodes well for cheap energy stocks.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOf course, investors will want to be vigilant given the unique circumstances of the post-pandemic ecosystem. Still, the below energy stocks to buy in August present an enticing proposition.Marathon Petroleum (MPC)Panorama of Oil and Gas central processing platform in twilight, offshore hard work occupation twenty four working hours. Best oil stocks to buySource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.comA midstream and upstream specialist, Marathon Petroleum (NYSE:MPC) focuses on petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation. Just from a technical standpoint, MPC easily ranks as one of the energy stocks to buy now. In the trailing five sessions, MPC gained almost 8% of its equity value. And in the past 30 (calendar) days, it skyrocketed over 26%.Nevertheless, here’s the shocking part: MPC also makes a case for ranking among undervalued energy stocks. According to investment data aggregator Gurufocus, Marathon posted a three-year revenue growth rate (per-share basis) of 27.1%, above 80.33% of the competition. Nevertheless, MPC trades at a trailing revenue multiple of only 0.44. In contrast, the sector median stat pings at 1.03x.Story continuesFinally, Wall Street analysts peg MPC as a consensus strong buy. Understandably, though, the average price target lands at $151.11, implying less than 1% upside potential. However, the high-side target comes in at $164, implying almost 10% growth. That might be a worthwhile bet considering that MPC’s one of the cheap energy stocks.HF Sinclair (DINO)Oil. 3D Illustration. Oil stocks are up.Source: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.comA diversified energy firm, HF Sinclair (NYSE:DINO) focuses on the downstream segment of the energy value chain. Specifically, the company manufactures and sells products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, and specialty lubricant products, among other categories. Like other energy stocks to buy now, DINO has been absolutely rocking. Just in the trailing one-month period, DINO gained over 28% of market value.So far this year, the robust gains have translated to a return of almost 20%. Nevertheless, DINO ranks among the undervalued energy stocks. Presently, the company runs a three-year revenue growth rate of 21.8%, above 74% of sector rivals. At the same time, DINO trades at a trailing sales multiple of 0.34. This compares favorably to the sector median of 1.03x.Lastly, covering analysts peg DINO as a consensus strong buy. Given the robust performance recently, the average price target – which lands at $60.25 – only represents under 2% upside potential. However, the high-side target stands at $70, which implies 18% growth.PBF Energy (PBF)In the field, the oil pump in the evening, the evening silhouette of the pumping unit, the silhouette of the oil pump. Oil stocks and energy stocksSource: zhengzaishuru / Shutterstock.comAnother upstream specialist, PBF Energy (NYSE:PBF) is a petroleum refiner and supplier of unbranded transportation fuels, heating oils, lubricants, and other petroleum-related products. As with other top energy stocks to buy in August, PBF has been on a roll. Since the beginning of this year, shares gained nearly 33% of equity value. And the hits just keep on coming.In the trailing five years, PBF scored a return of over 9%. In the past month, shares stormed to a nearly 25% gain. At this point, you wouldn’t think that PBF ranks among the cheap energy stocks. However, you’d be wrong. Operationally, you’re looking at a three-year revenue growth rate of 22.4%, above nearly 75% of its peers. Nevertheless, PBF trades at 0.15x trailing sales.As a bonus, the market prices PBF with a forward earnings multiple of 5.47, which is also significantly undervalued. To close, analysts peg PBF as a consensus moderate buy with a $51.63 average price target. That only implies about 4% upside. However, the high-side target calls for $62, implying over 24% growth.Valero Energy (VLO)the gas pumps at a Valero gas stationSource: JustPixs / Shutterstock.comYet another entry in the downstream component of the sector energy chain, Valero Energy (NYSE:VLO) mostly concentrates on manufacturing and marketing transportation fuels. It’s also involved in the power business. Similar to other resurgent energy stocks, VLO has benefited from a robust sentiment shift. For the year, Valero gained almost 16% of its equity value.Better yet, momentum continues to run hot. In the trailing five sessions, VLO swung up over 8%. And in the trailing month, shares returned almost 23%. Operationally, Valero impresses with a three-year revenue growth rate of 19.4% and an EBITDA growth rate during the same period of 45.7%. Nevertheless, VLO trades at 0.33x trailing sales.Also, it’s worth pointing out that the market prices VLO at a 6.68x forward multiple. In contrast, the sector median stat clocks in at 9.14x. Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg VLO as a moderate buy. On average, the price target stands at $148.91, implying over 7% growth. The high-side target calls for $171, translating to 23% upside.Southwestern Energy (SWN)Natural Gas Combined Cycle Power Plant with sunset and light orange. Best natural gas stocks to buy.Source: Rangsarit Chaiyakun / Shutterstock.comA natural gas exploration and production company, Southwestern Energy (NYSE:SWN) has benefited from the sentiment pivot in energy stocks. With the underlying commodity at particular risk due to the current geopolitical environment, the upside isn’t that surprising. Still, it’s an impressive performance. So far this year, SWN gained almost 18% of its equity value.Admittedly, in the week ended Aug. 11, SWN tripped up about 1%. However, in the trailing month, shares swung to a 10% gain. Despite the broadly positive performance, SWN ranks among the cheap energy stocks to consider. For example, the company posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 33.8%, outflanking 86% of companies in the oil and gas industry.Nevertheless, SWN trades at 0.64x trailing revenue, which sits favorably beneath 65.39% of its peers. Also, it trades at 2.16x operating cash flow, beneath the sector median of 4.66x. Currently, analysts peg SWN as a consensus moderate buy. Further, it’s one of the energy stocks to buy in August because of its $7.78 average price target, which implies 20% upside.GeoPark (GPRK)miniature oil barrel and oil well figures on top of stack of moneySource: ShutterstockFor the next two energy stocks, I’m going to go on a contrarian route, first with GeoPark (NYSE:GPRK). According to its website, GeoPark is a leading independent exploration and production company based in Latin America. Unlike the other names on this list, GPRK, unfortunately, has not yet benefited from the sector resurgence. Since the Jan. opener, shares have tumbled over 29%.Obviously, that’s not a great confidence booster. What could be said, though, is that sentiment may finally be turning in the northbound direction. In the five sessions that ended Aug. 11, shares gained just under 5%. Granted, there are no guarantees here. However, the underlying financials also entice onlookers.Specifically, GeoPark’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 20.4%. However, shares trade at only 0.69x trailing sales. As well, the market prices GPRK at 3.5x forward earnings, which is practically subterranean. Presently, no one covers GPRK. However, from the analysts that did cover it several months ago, it may have the potential for robust double-digit gains.Murphy USA (MUSA)Murphy USA gas station and convenience store located on an out parcel of a Walmart SupercenterSource: Lawrence Glass / Shutterstock.comFor a truly contrarian look among energy stocks to buy in August, check out Murphy USA (NYSE:MUSA). A downstream specialist, Murphy operates a chain of retail gasoline stations primarily located in proximity to Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stores. As with its peers, MUSA has been on the move. Since the beginning of this year, MUSA gained almost 16%. In the trailing five sessions, it’s up about 5%.Here’s where circumstances get squirrely. Right now, none of the analysts that presently cover MUSA rates it as a buy. Instead, we’re looking at three holds and one sell. Also, the average price target of $301.25 implies almost 5% downside risk.Although the naysayers could be right, I’m going to disagree. First, MUSA represents one of the undervalued energy stocks. While printing a three-year revenue growth rate of 30.5%, it maintains a sales multiple of 0.3x. Second, Murphy’s location in proximity to Walmart stores is a great business model based on current circumstances. Basically, people will be looking for discounts on their gas and Murphy can soak up that demand volume. So, in my opinion, it’s a buy.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Of course, this concept begs the question, why the heck would you want to do something like that?First off, we must consider the valuation perspective. While direct-play AI stocks to buy command significant attention, they also carry significant premiums. With concerns rising about the stability of the economy, it might not be the right move to acquire overvalued enterprises. Therefore, non-tech ideas that still use digital intelligence could offer a bargain idea.Second, there’s a big difference between laboratory AI and applicable AI. If the underlying innovation is actually useful, it will give early adopters a massive advantage over its peers. Subsequently, investors desiring the next big thing in the market should target these non-tech AI stocks to buy.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWalmart (WMT)Walmart (WMT) logo on a store frontSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comAlthough Walmart (NYSE:WMT) commands a reputation for spearheading the big-box retailer segment, it’s also one of the top AI stocks to buy. That might seem strange at first. However, the company has been aggressively investing in digital intelligence, deploying chatbots, shopping assistants, and associate productivity tools.Further, Dan Bartlett, Walmart’s executive vice president of corporate affairs mentioned that AI should make its employees’ lives easier in the backroom (or warehouse), and in the front of its super centers. Fundamentally, this framework should help free up more time for Walmart associates to spend time interacting with customers. After all, sales take place on the sales floor.Overall, WMT ranks as one of the best stocks to buy from a holistic standpoint. Even if economic conditions worsen, people will still seek discounts for various goods. Thus, Walmart stands in a prime position. Finally, analysts peg WMT as a consensus strong buy. Further, their average price target lands at $173.31, implying almost 8% upside potential.Story continuesUnitedHealth (UNH)The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comA multinational managed healthcare and insurance company, UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) doesn’t typically light up the radar as a tech innovator. However, it just so happens to be that it also ranks among the top AI stocks to buy. As you know, the broader healthcare ecosystem must deal with a good deal of paperwork and client data. It can be overwhelming for human operators. Fortunately, digital intelligence protocols can help ease the workload.In addition, UnitedHealth has already incorporated AI into several components of its business. For example, the company features an AI-enhanced virtual assistant platform to collect patient data and offer customized solutions. Moreover, UnitedHealth is developing a centralized data platform with the ultimate aim of improving patient outcomes.Lastly, analysts peg UNH as a consensus strong buy. This assessment breaks down as 16 buys, two holds, and zero sell ratings. Also, the experts’ average price target clocks in at $571.53, implying almost 13% upside potential.H&amp;R Block (HRB)Image of a yellow building featuring the H&amp;R Block (HRB) logoSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to tax season, H&amp;R Block (NYSE:HRB) ranks among the top companies to consider, especially if you have complicated returns. However, as a consultancy firm at heart, it’s not exactly one of the tech-driven growth stocks. Nevertheless, for those seeking non-tech investments that may do well in digital intelligence, HRB deserves closer examination.True, on a year-to-date basis, HRB isn’t anything special. It’s barely above parity. However, it’s been on the move, gaining nearly 7% of equity value in the trailing month. Better yet, H&amp;R Block offers one of the clearest examples of how AI can augment almost any enterprise.About two months ago, the tax consultancy announced a partnership with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to leverage the latter’s Azure OpenAI services. Basically, the cooperative agreement should help deliver critical tax advice at a higher volume quicker than ever.

This has created a combined company with a total equity market capitalization of more than $11 billion and an enterprise value of more than $16 billion.The acquisition, which expands Regency’s footprint of high-quality, grocery-anchored shopping centers in premier suburban trade areas, is projected to be immediately accretive to core operating earnings.According to Lisa Palmer, the president and chief executive officer of Regency, “These centers align well with Regency’s portfolio strategy and meaningfully expand our presence in strong trade areas in the Northeast.”With the combined portfolio comprising 480 properties and encompassing more than 56 million square feet of gross leasable area, the move enhances Regency's geographic diversification, tenant mix, growth prospects and balance sheet strength.Per the company’s earlier press release with respect to this acquisition, the transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to Regency's core operating earnings, including roughly $9 million of annual cost savings benefit. The merger also preserves Regency’s strong balance sheet and flexibility for further growth, maintaining a pro forma leverage at the low end of its 5X-5.5X target range.The move combined two highly aligned portfolios of high-quality, open-air shopping centers that are predominantly anchored by grocery stores and located in premier suburban trade areas. Both companies have a successful track record of owning and operating best-in-class retail properties with strong tenant rosters and high occupancy rates. In an industry where strategic alignments can bring about significant growth and value creation, this merger signals a promising future for REG shareholders.Regency’s strategically located shopping centers in affluent suburban areas and near urban trade areas enable it to attract top grocers and retailers and position it well to ride the growth curve. Its focus on grocery-anchored shopping centers assures dependable traffic, aiding occupancy levels and rent growth. Further, accretive buyouts, an encouraging development pipeline and a solid balance sheet are likely to drive long-term growth.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 4.9% in the past three months, outperforming its industry’s increase of 2.9%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, higher e-commerce adoption and efforts of online retailers to go deeper into the grocery business are worrisome for Regency.

In a perfect world, we'd like to see a company investing more capital into its business and ideally the returns earned from that capital are also increasing. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE:PG) we really liked what we saw.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Procter &amp; Gamble:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.22 = US$19b ÷ (US$121b - US$36b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023).So, Procter &amp; Gamble has an ROCE of 22%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 15% earned by companies in a similar industry. Check out our latest analysis for Procter &amp; Gamble roceIn the above chart we have measured Procter &amp; Gamble's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Procter &amp; Gamble's ROCE Trend?Procter &amp; Gamble has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. The figures show that over the last five years, ROCE has grown 47% whilst employing roughly the same amount of capital. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking.Story continuesThe Bottom LineTo bring it all together, Procter &amp; Gamble has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.On a final note, we've found   2 warning signs for Procter &amp; Gamble  that we think you should be aware of.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

But that hasn't deterred legendary investor Warren Buffett from placing big bets in the sector.In its latest 13F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Buffett's company Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK) disclosed new stakes in three U.S. homebuilders.Investors often pay close attention to Buffett's 13F filings because of his track record of generating consistent returns over the decades. From 1964 to 2022, Berkshire delivered total returns of 3,787,464%, substantially outperforming the S&amp;P 500's 24,708% gain during the same period.Buffett is also no stranger to making contrarian moves. He famously said, ""Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.""Check out:Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here’s how to invest in the city’s growth before he floods it with new tech workers.Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup.Here's a closer look at the three companies he just loaded up on.D.R. Horton Inc. (NYSE:DHI)Berkshire's 13F filing revealed that it bought 5,969,714 shares of D.R. Horton in the second quarter. At the current share price, the stake is worth $693.6 million.Headquartered in Arlington, Texas, D.R. Horton is America's largest homebuilder by volume. It operates in 33 states and has a diverse product portfolio with sale prices ranging from $200,000 to over $1 million. The company also builds and sells single-family rental and multifamily rental properties.In the fiscal quarter that ended June 30, D.R. Horton's consolidated revenue increased 11% year over year to $9.7 billion. Homes closed grew 8% to 22,985, while net sales orders rose 37% to 22,879 homes.Story continuesNet income, on the other hand, decreased 19% from a year ago to $1.3 billion for the quarter.D.R. Horton shares initially surged after Berkshire revealed its stake but later retraced those gains. Nevertheless, the shares have risen over 28% in 2023.Lennar Corp. (NYSE:LEN)Lennar is another heavyweight player in the home construction business.Established in 1954, Lennar builds homes in various markets across the country. It delivered 66,399 homes in fiscal 2022.In addition to its core homebuilding operations, the company offers financial services, including mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services.In the second quarter of Lennar's fiscal 2023, which ended May 31, its revenue from home sales slipped 4% year over year to $7.6 billion. The decline was because of a 7% decrease in average sales price, partially offset by a 3% increase in the number of home deliveries.Lennar Executive Chairman Stuart Miller said that demand has accelerated as consumers ""have come to accept a ‘new normal' range for interest rates.""Berkshire acquired 152,572 Lennar shares in the second quarter, a position valued at $17.8 million today.NVR Inc. (NYSE:NVR)Buffett's company also picked up 11,112 shares of NVR in the second quarter. With NVR shares trading at $6,078, the stake is worth $67.5 million.NVR constructs and sells homes under the brands of Ryan Homes, NVHomes and Heartland Homes. It also has a building products division, a mortgage subsidiary and a settlement and title services subsidiary.In the second quarter, new orders for NVR's homebuilding business increased by 27% year over year to 5,905 units. But the average sales price of new orders in the quarter was $447,300, down 5% compared to a year ago.NVR stock has outperformed D.R. Horton and Lennar in 2023 — shares are up 32% year to date.While investors can leverage homebuilder stocks to access the housing market, new companies have innovated ways for people to earn passive income from real estate.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on like D.R. Horton DHI, Lennar LEN and NVR NVR.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Many analysts are bullish on e-commerce giant MercadoLibre's stock at the moment with the company's top and bottom-line continuing to expand at a monstrous rate.Earnings estimates are beginning to soar after impressive Q2 results earlier in the month and MercadoLibre's stock currently carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and the Bull of the Day.Stellar Q2 Results Based in Argentina, MercardoLibre operates one of the largest e-commerce platforms in South America. Thinking MercardoLibre's well-documented and renowned growth can't continue would be a mistake.To that point, Q2 earnings of $5.16 per share easily surpassed estimates of $4.13 a share by 25%. This also soared 112% from earnings of $2.43 a share in Q2 2022. Second-quarter sales of $3.41 billion beat expectations by 4% and climbed 31% from $2.59 billion in the prior-year quarter.Furthermore, MercadoLibre had a 16.3% profit margin on income from operations which nearly doubled to $558 million.It's also noteworthy that the company's gross merchandise value (GMV) hit the $10 billion mark for the first time driven by strength in Brazil and Mexico. MercadoLibre's GMV came in at $10.5 billion also beating Zacks estimates by 4%.Robust Growth Continues Consumers in South America are more accustomed to economic headwinds so inflation did not slow MercadoLibre's growth like one might think. Still, as inflation begins to ease MercadoLibre's presence in many South American countries along with Mexico and Spain is expected to accelerate its growth.Fiscal 2023 earnings estimates have now risen 16% over the last month after MercardoLibre's Q2 report helped reconfirm this. Even better, FY24 earnings estimates have soared 17% in the last 30 days.Story continuesMercadoLibre's annual earnings are now forecasted to skyrocket 103% this year to $19.39 per share compared to $9.53 a share in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are anticipated to leap another 55% to $30.01 per share.This will be accompanied by robust top-line expansion as well with sales projected to climb 31% this year to $13.86 billion compared to $10.54 billion in 2022. More impressively, FY24 sales are expected to soar another 24% and projections of $17.22 billion would represent an astonishing 652% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $2.29 billion.Bottom Line Simply put, now looks like a great time to buy MercadoLibre stock as the company is strategically set up for growth with e-commerce operations in lucrative economic hubs throughout Latin America.Easing inflation will only fuel the company's growth potential and with MercadoLibre's stock up 42% this year it's notable that the Average Zacks Price Target of $1,634.50 per share still suggests 36% upside from current levels.Bear of the Day:Following lackluster Q2 results in late July, earnings estimate revisions are still noticeably lower for Churchill Downs stock landing it a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the Bear of the Day.Churchill Downs is the world's most legendary horse track but there have been short-term concerns after the company had to suspend operations at the historic venue following the deaths of 12 horses in May alone.The horses were euthanized after suffering serious injuries on the racetrack which has created unwanted headlines over the last few months.Declining Earnings Estimates It's notable that Churchill missed Q2 top and bottom line expectations. Earnings missed estimates by -10% with Q2 EPS at $2.24 per share compared to estimates of $2.50 a share. On the top line, sales of $768.50 million came up -3% short of estimates.The lackluster results may not seem too alarming but amid the mounting safety and health concerns, earnings estimates are largely down over the last two months despite ticking up in the last week.Analysts are expecting Churchill to have expansive bottom-line growth over the next few years but fiscal 2023 earnings estimates are down -11% over the last 60 days with FY24 EPS estimates down -7%. This has correlated with Churchill's stock falling -16% over the last three months despite shares of CHDN still up +15% for the year.Valuation Concerns Taking a closer look at Churchill's valuation we can see some cracks as well. Looking at Churchill's PEG ratio may be beneficial right now due to the hiccups from halting horseraces.With the PEG ratio, analysts can compare a company's valuation with different growth rates. Taking the price-to-earnings ratio and dividing it by the long-term growth rate consensus, the optimum PEG is less than 1.Unfortunately, Churchill's PEG is currently at 9.9 and well above this level along with its industry average of 4.6, and the S&amp;P 500's 1.71.Bottom Line While Churchill Downs is expected to resume live racing at its namesake Kentucky Derby track in September, investors may want to be cautious of its stock until the smoke clears surrounding health and safety concerns for horses at its venue.Additional content:3 Must-Buy Housing Stocks That Buffett Made a Big Bet OnThe recent spike in Treasury bond yields that resulted in an uptick in mortgage rates does not favor the homebuilding industry. However, homebuilders have seen an upsurge in their share prices for most of this year, thanks to a rebound in new home sales that took a beating last year due to the housing slump.Homebuilders, all through this year, have applied innovative strategies to attract potential buyers of new homes. They have kept affordable prices on the properties and offered mortgage rate buydowns. Shortage of existing homes in the housing market has also increased the requirement for newly constructed homes, eventually enhancing the sales figures for housebuilders.In reality, the construction of new homes picked up in July. After being adjusted seasonally, the annual rate of housing starts climbed to 1.452 million last month, per the Census Bureau. It surpassed market expectations of 1.448 million.Single-family housing starts, which mostly constitute the bulk of the construction, jumped 6.7% in July from the prior month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 983,000 units. The jump in single-family housing starts was primarily seen in the western part of the United States. Additionally, building permits ticked up 0.1% to an annual rate of 1.442 million units last month. Applications to build one-family homes increased to their highest level in more than a year.Let us also not forget that construction spending in the United States already increased strongly in June. Outlays on constructing single and multifamily housing establishments rose 0.5% in June, while May's figure was revised to show spending increasing 1.1% from an earlier reported 0.9%, per the Commerce Department.Thus, with builders ramping up housing construction as buyers search for reasonably priced homes, housing stocks like D.R. Horton, Lennar and NVR are well-poised to benefit soon.What's more, one of the best role models for any investor, Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK.B) recently disclosed that he has made big bets on these three U.S. home builders in the second quarter of 2023. The Oracle of Omaha's Berkshire Hathaway owned DR Horton, Lennar and NVR shares worth a total of $814 million, as of Jun 30.Thus, these stocks make compelling investment choices at the moment. The stocks boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.D.R. Horton is one of the leading national homebuilders, primarily engaged in the construction and sale of single-family houses. D.R.

He said pilots deserved to be compensated in line with the “tremendous amount of responsibility” they take with every flight.CEO Robert Isom said the agreement will help American immediately expand its pilot training and provide pilots with more opportunities for career advancement.American has about 15,000 pilots.Airline unions are enjoying leverage to get big pay raises because a boom in travel is lifting airline revenue. Texas-based American earned $1.3 billion in the second quarter alone, helped by strong ticket sales, record revenue, and a drop in the price of jet fuel. Pilot unions have been in particularly strong position because of a shortage that is being felt most keenly at smaller carriers.Pilots at American rejected an offer last November. They reached another agreement in late July, which was renegotiated again after United Airlines  approved a tentative deal with its pilots. Pilots at Delta Air Lines won big pay raises earlier this year.Pilots at Southwest Airlines are still in negotiations.Wage rates for American pilots will rise at least 41% and perhaps more if United pilots ratify their agreement, according to a spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association.The union said its new contract with American includes $1.1 billion in one-time payments and ratification bonuses and immediate pay raises averaging 21%. Annual raises, plus increased company contributions to retirement plans, will raise the value of total compensation by more than 46% over four years, according to the union.It also includes more vacation benefits and changes designed to give pilots more predictable schedules, the union said.Airline industry labor contracts do not expire — that's part of a federal law designed to make strikes nearly impossible. Rather, they become open for change or “amendable” at their conclusion. Bargaining on the next contract for American's pilots could begin as soon as November 2026.]"

346,e32ef5ca-239b-3f6a-a04f-5587b3409041,PFG,2023-08-22,Principal Financial Group (NASDAQ:PFG) shareholders have earned a 24% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/principal-financial-group-nasdaq-pfg-101726701.html,1692699446,STORY,['PFG'],"[One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. Just take a look at Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFG), which is up 70%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 21% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 2.8% , including dividends .Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. See our latest analysis for Principal Financial Group While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During three years of share price growth, Principal Financial Group achieved compound earnings per share growth of 13% per year. This EPS growth is lower than the 19% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did three years ago. It is quite common to see investors become enamoured with a business, after a few years of solid progress.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Principal Financial Group's TSR for the last 3 years was 91%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectivePrincipal Financial Group provided a TSR of 2.8% over the last twelve months. But that return falls short of the market. If we look back over five years, the returns are even better, coming in at 10% per year for five years. It may well be that this is a business worth popping on the watching, given the continuing positive reception, over time, from the market. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  Principal Financial Group is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — are up 4.1%, 13.8% and 27%, respectively. However, volatility has shown its ugly face once again in August owing to both internal and external factors.Consequently, month to date, the S&amp;P 500 Index is down 4.8%. Last week, the S&amp;P 500 fell 2.1%, marking its third-straight weekly loss, for the first time since February. The index’s last three-week loss of 4.6% is its biggest decline since the three weeks ended Mar 10.Nevertheless, the long-term trend of U.S. stock markets remains bullish. The inflation rate is dwindling steadily since June 2022. Fundamentals of the economy remain strong with a resilient labor market and solid consumer spending. These developments have brightened the chance of the Fed’s so-called “soft landing” and reduces the possibility of a near-term recession.At this stage, it will be prudent to invest in dividend-paying S&amp;P 500 stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that have provided positive returns in the past month with more upside left. If the index’s downturn continues, dividend will act as a regular income stream. If the benchmark resumes its northward journey, favorable Zacks Rank will capture the upsides.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five such stocks with strong potential for the rest of 2023. These stocks have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our pick sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past month.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCaterpillar Inc. CAT has seen year-over-year revenue and earnings growth for nine straight quarters thanks to its cost-saving actions, strong end-market demand and pricing actions that offset the impact of supply-chain snarls and cost pressures. We expect CAT’s adjusted earnings per share for 2023 to grow 20% and revenues to rise 8%.Story continuesCaterpillar has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 12% and 40.5%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.2% over the last seven days. CAT has a current dividend yield of 1.9%.Ross Stores Inc. ROST has benefited from positive customer response to its improved merchandise and strong value offerings. ROST has been benefiting from the execution of its store expansion plans over the years.ROST operates a chain of off-price retail apparel and home accessories stores, which target value-conscious men and women, aged 25 to 54 in middle-to-upper middle-class households. ROST has a proven business model as the competitive bargains it offers continue to make its stores attractive destinations for customers in all economic scenarios.Ross Stores has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 4.8% and 18.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2023). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.6% over the last seven days. ROST has a current dividend yield of 1.1%.PulteGroup Inc. PHM has been riding high since it reported solid second-quarter results. PHM’s solid operating model, which strategically aligns the production of build-to-order and quick-move-in homes with applicable demand across consumer groups, aided the result.Backed by its disciplined and balanced business model, PHM witnessed solid gross closings, orders and margins in the reported quarter and posted a 12-month return on equity of 32%. PHM expects to close 7,000-7,400 homes in the third quarter and 29,500 homes this year. PHM expects its community count to grow by 5-10% in the third and fourth quarters.PulteGroup has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.4% and 7.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 25.5% over the last 30 days. PHM has a current dividend yield of 0.8%.Eaton Corp. plc ETN will benefit from improving end market conditions and contribution from its organic assets which will assist it in retaining a strong market position. ETN is expanding via strategic acquisitions and its rising backlog shows strong demand for its products.The ongoing research and development are allowing ETN to develop products for efficient power management solutions. ETN’s strategy to manufacture in the zone of sale has helped it to cut costs.Eaton has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.3% and 16.3%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.5% over the last seven days. ETN has a current dividend yield of 1.6%.Pentair plc PNR anticipates volumes in the pool business to remain weak this year due to the ongoing inventory correction. However, the ongoing momentum in the Industrial and Flow Technologies and Water Solutions segments will offset the impact.Pricing actions, gains from the Manitowoc Ice acquisition and savings from the Transformation program are expected to offset the impacts of inflated costs and supply-chain issues on PNR’s margins. Focus on digital initiatives, innovation and acquisitions will aid growth. PNR’s Transformation Program is expected to drive margin expansion of at least 400 basis points by 2025.Pentair has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 0.3% and 1.6%, respectively, for the current year.

This journey can be traced back to early 2019, wherein Aflac launched “One Digital Aflac”. LTIMindtree is a digital solution and technology consulting company, having expertise in cloud migration. This collaboration should accelerate Aflac’s objective to move 100% in the cloud. However, shares of Aflac lost 1% on Aug 18, replicating a decline in broader markets.This move bodes well for Aflac as rearchitecting its applications with a cloud-first approach would result in the optimization of costs, performance efficiency and better security resulting in operational superiority. LTIMindtree will be using Amazon Web Service’s (“AWS”) cloud-native services to shift AFL’s on-prem applications, which are currently hosted via an out-of-support platform.The company aims to accelerate its digital transformation journey, evolving from a traditional in-person and independent agent business to a more digital approach. Aflac has transformed its claim processing and enhanced claims experience for employees and policyholders using cutting-edge technologies. Moving applications to the cloud should deliver business value and make AFL’s products more competitive in the market.LTIMindtree’s expertise in end-to-end cloud migration and factor-based delivery models should optimize cost without disruption. Moreover, security-related vulnerabilities will also be managed with the company’s expertise. The cost of ownership and application hosting has been reduced 20% and 30%, respectively, due to AWS migration. Availability and uptime improved more than 50% due to The Disaster Recovery capability.Zacks Rank &amp; Price PerformanceAflac currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

In the article, it highlighted 5 couples and singletons who had substantial investment portfolios, over $1 million, and several had over $4 million portfolios. That's impressive. They are rich.How'd they do it?None of those in the article were best selling novelists, movie stars, or professional athletes. That makes it seem even more obtainable for you and I. If they can do it, why not us?Lessons from Rich RetireesThose featured in the article seemingly had similar paths they followed to achieve this incredible wealth. This included,1.       They started investing early2.       They maxed out their 401ks3.       They invested in equities, both individual stocks and index funds. You don't have to get fancy.Keep it SimpleThe stocks listed in the article were big caps that you and I could also own. When Tracey has talked with her friend Ed, another rich retiree with a million-dollar stock portfolio, he too owned basic, large cap stocks, many of which paid dividends.Story continuesNone were IPOs or a small cap stock that was largely unknown to most investors. These rich investors had kept it simple.1.       Bank of America BACWarren Buffett has owned Bank of America in the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio for years. It's up 108.3% over the last 10 years, but that's underperforming the S&amp;P 500 which is up 170% during that same time.Bank of America pays an attractive dividend again, however, now yielding 3%, which gives long-term investors even more firepower for compounding.Should value investors be considering a bank like Bank of America again?2.       The Sherwin-Williams Company SHWSherwin-Williams rarely gets much attention on the business shows like CNBC or Fox Business. But Tracey's friend Ed has owned it for decades. Over the last 10 years, shares of Sherwin-Williams are up 437.8% with the dividends reinvested. That's an annualized return of 18.3%.$10,000 invested in Sherwin-Williams in 2013 would be worth $53,780 in 2023.Does Sherwin-Williams still have further upside?3.       NVIDIA Corp. NVDANVIDIA was mentioned in the article as a holding by one of the rich retirees. If you had bought NVIDIA just 10 years ago, it would have gone up an astounding 11,786%.But in 2022, shares sold off so it now has a 2-year return of ""just"" 117%. But NVIDIA is a leader in AI and revenue is expected to rise 59% this fiscal year to $43 billion from $26 billion last year. That's impressive.Is NVIDIA a good buy-and-hold stock for long-term investors?4.       Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)Berkshire Hathaway shares have been hitting new all-time highs in 2023. For investors looking for a way to track Buffett's moves, including buy-and-hold, why not just buy shares of Berkshire's B shares?Shares of Berkshire Hathaway are up 218.9% over the last 10 years which beat the S&amp;P 500 which was up just 170% during that same time. Over 20 years, Berkshire is up 600.9% versus the S&amp;P 500 gaining 338.5%.Should Berkshire Hathaway be on your short list?5.       Vanguard 500 Index Fund VOOMany of the rich retirees said they owned ""indexes."" They didn't say which index but the most common one is the S&amp;P 500. The Vanguard 500 Index is one of the most common choices for those who want to own the S&amp;P 500 in an ETF because it has a low expense ratio of just 0.04%.Tracey owns shares of VOO in her own personal portfolio. It's up 14.1% year-to-date but hasn't yet hit another new all-time high this year. Buffett is a big fan of owning the indexes, like the VOO.Should the VOO be the first step in growing your own million-dollar portfolio?What Else Do You Need to Know About Retiring with Millions?    Tune into this week's podcast to find out.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

With 78% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Alliant Energy. View our latest analysis for Alliant Energy ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Alliant Energy?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Alliant Energy already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Alliant Energy's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Alliant Energy. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 13%. With 9.1% and 5.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, BlackRock, Inc. and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 17 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Alliant EnergyThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Alliant Energy Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$21m worth of shares (at current prices). It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 22% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Alliant Energy. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Alliant Energy  you should be aware of, and 1 of them doesn't sit too well with us.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

You can skip our detailed analysis on the economic contributions of the Hispanic or Latino community and head over directly to the 5 Cities with the Most Hispanics.Hispanics are Americans who trace their roots to Spain, Mexico, Latin America, and the Spanish-speaking islands of the Caribbean. They are the largest racial or ethnic minority in the United States – with an estimated population of 62.9 million as of July 2021 according to the Census Bureau – which equates to 18.9% of the total population in the country.A 2022 report by the Joint Economic Committee stated the total economic output of the Hispanic or Latino population of the United States to be an estimated $2 trillion. This includes five-million businesses that contribute $800 billion every year to the national economy. Number of Hispanic-owned businesses between 2012 and 2017 in the country grew by 14%, which was more than twice the national average. According to McKinsey &amp; Company, they also account for the fastest growing portion of the United States GDP. So much so that if the American Latinos had a country of their own, they would have the third highest GDP growth in the past decade after China and India.California, Texas, Florida, Arizona and New Mexico are the states with the highest Hispanic population. These states also have the highest concentration of Latino-owned businesses. In California, 85,000 of the total 764,000 businesses are owned by Hispanics or Latinos, which is equivalent to over 11% of all businesses in the state. These businesses provide jobs to an estimated 670,000 people and contribute $25 billion towards the state economy. These figures were shared by the Latino Policy and Politics Institute in August 2023.Hispanic Representation in Leading CompaniesDespite making up nearly one-fifths of the overall population of the US, Hispanics are underrepresented in boards of Fortune 500 companies and C-suites of corporate America – with less than 5% of top management positions in companies being held by Hispanics. Only 1% of all board seats are held by Latina women. 69% of the Fortune 1000 companies in 2021 did not have a single director from a Hispanic background. Only 20 of Fortune 500 companies had CEOs of Hispanic descent.Story continuesThis includes Juan Ricardo Luciano, the CEO of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM), which is a food processing and commodities trading company headquartered in Chicago, Illinois. Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) was ranked 35th in the 2023 Fortune 500 list, having a revenue of $101 billion in 2022. Luciano grew up in Argentina and studied engineering at the Buenos Aires Institute of Technology. He worked 25 years for Dow Chemical before taking over as the CEO of Archer-Daniels-Midland Company (NYSE:ADM) in 2015.One of the world’s most diversified and largest healthcare products companies, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is also headed by a Latino, Joaquin Duato, who is the CEO and Chairman of the Board at the company. Duato joined Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) 34 years ago and served as the Vice Chairman of the Executive Committee before becoming CEO in 2022. During the coronavirus pandemic, Duato spearheaded Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)’s efforts in ensuring employee health and that life-saving medicines including the company’s Covid-19 vaccine reached those who were in need.PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP)’s Chairman and CEO, Ramon Laguarta, was born in Spain and completed his undergraduate and master’s degrees from the ESADE Business School in Barcelona. He is the first Spanish to be the chief executive officer of PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP), and has held the position since 2018. Laguarta previously oversaw PepsiCo, Inc.

REGN announced that the FDA has finally approved aflibercept 8 mg for the treatment of patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD), diabetic macular edema (DME) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) under the brand name Eylea HD.The recommended dose for the drug is 8 mg every 4 weeks for the first 3 months across all indications, followed by 8 mg every 8 to 16 weeks (2 to 4 months) in wAMD and DME and every 8 to 12 weeks (2 to 3 months) for DR.The approval by the regulatory body was based on the 48-week results of two studies, PULSAR and PHOTON. These two double-masked, active-controlled pivotal trials compared Eylea HD to aflibercept injection at 2 mg.We note that a 2 mg dose of aflibercept is already approved under the brand name Eylea for various ophthalmology indications.Data from the above-mentioned studies showed Eylea HD demonstrated clinically equivalent vision gains to Eylea that were maintained with fewer injections.We remind investors that the FDA earlier issued a complete response letter (CRL) to the company’s biologics license application seeking approval for the 8 mg dose strength of aflibercept for the treatment of patients with wAMD, DME and DR.The cause of the CRL was only an ongoing review of inspection findings at a third-party filler and the FDA did not request any additional clinical data or studies.The approval of Eylea HD will relieve investors somewhat, as Eylea sales have been under pressure in the last couple of quarters due to competition from Roche’s Vabysmo and sale deductions.Regulatory filings for aflibercept 8 mg are under review in Europe and Japan.

The candidate has been approved under the brand name Veopoz.Per Regeneron, Veopoz is the first and only treatment indicated specifically for CHAPLE, an ultra-rare hereditary disease that can cause potentially life-threatening gastrointestinal and cardiovascular symptoms.Veopoz is also being evaluated in combination with Alnylam’s ALNY cemdisiran (siRNAi C5 inhibitor) as an investigational combination therapy for the treatment of other complement-mediated disorders, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria and myasthenia gravis.In 2019, Regeneron and Alnylam entered into a global, strategic collaboration to discover, develop and commercialize RNAi therapeutics for a broad range of diseases by addressing therapeutic disease targets expressed in the eye and central nervous system, in addition to a select number of targets expressed in the liver. In the same year, both companies entered into a license agreement for a combination consisting of cemdisiran and pozelimab.

But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. One great example is Ameriprise Financial, Inc. (NYSE:AMP) which saw its share price drive 130% higher over five years. On top of that, the share price is up 11% in about a quarter. But this could be related to the strong market, which is up 4.3% in the last three months.Since the long term performance has been good but there's been a recent pullback of 3.4%, let's check if the fundamentals match the share price. View our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Ameriprise Financial achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 15% per year. So the EPS growth rate is rather close to the annualized share price gain of 18% per year. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Ameriprise Financial's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Ameriprise Financial, it has a TSR of 156% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Ameriprise Financial shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 22% over the last year. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 21%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Given the share price momentum remains strong, it might be worth taking a closer look at the stock, lest you miss an opportunity. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

Investors will also be eyeing results from Macy's (M), Lowe's (LOW), Peloton (PTON), Gap (GPS), Toll Brothers (TOL), and Dollar Tree (DLTR). There is some key housing data on tap Tuesday and Wednesday. The big event of the week though is Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell's speech at the Jackson Hole Economic Symposium on Friday. Yahoo Finance Reporter Josh Schafer breaks down the events investors need to be watching this week.Video Transcript- Well, we have a solid week ahead of us with housing data, the Fed, big earnings. Here to break it all down for us, Yahoo Finance reporter, Josh Schafer. Hey, Josh.JOSH SCHAFER: Hey, Julie. Yeah. So we've got another fun week to close out our-- almost close out August for us. Here and right now, what I have next to me is the earnings schedule for this week. So you can see we're expecting Zoom today. We're going to have Dick's Sporting Goods and Lowe's later this week. Urban Outfitters, Macy's, Gap. Another look at that consumer.But the big one here, we gave it its own special day. I should mention companies like Peloton also report on Wednesday, but we did circle out Nvidia on purpose. This will be a key market driver to find out what we know more about in that artificial intelligence story. You remember Nvidia boosting its guidance last quarter, saying it expected revenue to grow about 50% more than it initially had. That sent the stock soaring. That sent really the stock market soaring and the NASDAQ soaring in that overall AI hype story.The street right now is expecting Nvidia to report about $11 billion in quarterly revenue. So we'll be closely tracking if they meet that number. Julian Emanuel, a strategist over Evercore, said that he thinks how Nvidia performs on Wednesday after the bell could tell us if stocks continue to head down for August or if we get a bounce back. So it seems like not just a report, Julie, for tech there but maybe a report that tells us about overall market sentiment depending on how it goes.Story continues- Yeah, for sure. Let's also talk eco data for the week because we got some stuff there to pay attention.JOSH SCHAFER: Yeah. It's another fun week of eco data. And really, the big one here is on Friday. But when you take a look, we have existing home sales and some home data that we're going to be taking a look at this week. And then also be interesting to see if manufacturing PMI ticks back up closer to that 50 number.But you notice there's not a lot of the bigger stuff we normally talk about in terms of any look at inflation or labor, which is important to note because we have Federal Reserve Chair Jay Powell speaking on Friday at Jackson Hole. Now some economists think that we won't get much of an indicator on what the Fed feels about rates for the September meeting and if they're going to move again because we don't have those key data points. We're going to have the labor report come next week. We're going to have another print on inflation also come next week.So I think what the large portion of the focus is going to be for this meeting is how Chair Powell feels about the overall resilient economy that we've been talking about for the last two months. Has it been too resilient, and does he come out and be more hawkish? There are some people sort of anticipating that. So the final thing I want to take a look at here is just the September expectations for if the Fed were to move or not.You can see here, right now, the market is pricing in a nearly 89% chance that the Fed does not move interest rates come September. This will be the chart I'm looking at Friday afternoon to see what happens to this chart right here after Chair Powell speaks. Do we see people more confident that the Fed will hold in September? Or is he overly hawkish, and maybe there's a little bit more movement here that people might expect a move on interest rates to come in September? That's something I'm excited for come Friday.- I mean, those move a lot. So we're definitely going to see something happen there.]"

GPS is expected to witness earnings growth when it reports second-quarter fiscal 2023 numbers on Aug 24.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fiscal second-quarter bottom line is pegged at 9 cents per share, suggesting 12.5% growth from the prior-year quarter’s actual. The consensus estimate for the fiscal second-quarter earnings has moved up by a penny in the past seven days. For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $3.6 billion, indicating a 6.7% decline from that reported in the year-ago quarter.In the last reported quarter, Gap’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 105.9%. The company delivered a significant earnings surprise of 1,007.2%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.The Gap, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise The Gap, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseThe Gap, Inc. price-eps-surprise | The Gap, Inc. QuoteKey Factors to NoteGap has been aggressively undertaking cost-management actions, which are expected to have improved its performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Some notable efforts were increasing spans of control and decreasing management layers to improve the quality and speed of decision-making, as well as creating a consistent organizational structure across all four brands.Gap’s second-quarter fiscal 2023 performance is expected to have gained from improved margins, driven by increases in merchandise margins due to lower airfreight and reduced promotions. Lower advertising expenses and technology investments from cost-saving actions also bode well.On the last reported quarter’s earnings call, management predicted the second-quarter fiscal 2023 gross margin to expand year over year.We expect the adjusted gross margin to expand 110 basis points (bps) year over year to 37.1% in the fiscal second quarter, suggesting a decline in the cost of sales due to lower freight expenses. Our model estimates adjusted SG&amp;A expenses (operating expense) to decline 1.6% year over year to $1.3 billion in the fiscal second quarter, in line with the company’s guidance.Additionally, the company is expected to have benefited from the continued momentum across its Athleta brand. The Athleta brand’s value-driven active and lifestyle categories, increased digital marketing investments, and focus on product strategy have been aiding sales. Increased focus on performance active, as well as active lifestyle products, to capitalize on the evolving shopping trends, bodes well.Gap has been on track with the execution of its Power Plan 2023, which focuses on opening highly profitable Old Navy and Athleta stores, while closing the underperforming Gap and Banana Republic stores. As part of the plan, the company expects the Old Navy and Athleta brands to contribute about 70% to sales by 2023.However, Gap is expected to have witnessed continued inflationary pressure and drab demand in the to-be-reported quarter. The inflationary headwinds are expected to have partly offset growth in the gross margin in the fiscal second quarter.Further, the uncertain macro and consumer environments are expected to have taken a toll on Gap’s top-line performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Rising prices of essential commodities are likely to have hurt lower-income consumers' spending on non-essentials like apparel.In its last earnings report, management expected second-quarter fiscal 2023 sales to decrease in the mid to high-single-digit range compared to last year's reported figure of $3.86 billion. This view included $60 million in sales for Gap China.Story continuesZacks ModelOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Gap this season.

(CSCO) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-csco-trending-130011921.html,1692622811,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned +4.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Networking industry, which Cisco falls in, has gained 6.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Cisco is expected to post earnings of $1 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.04 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +3.9%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.20 indicates a change of +4.1% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Cisco.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Cisco, the consensus sales estimate of $14.6 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +7.1%. The $57.74 billion and $58.98 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +1.3% and +2.2%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $15.2 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16%. EPS of $1.14 for the same period compares with $0.83 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.04%. The EPS surprise was +7.55%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
