However, not all of these methodologies have been able to deliver remarkable returns.Fund Sponsor &amp; IndexThe fund is managed by Charles Schwab, and has been able to amass over $2.90 billion, which makes it one of the larger ETFs in the World ETFs. Before fees and expenses, FNDC seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI Developed ex-U.S. Small Co. Index (Net).The Russell RAFI Developed ex US Small Company Index (Net) measures the performance of the small company size segment by fundamental overall company scores, which are created using as the universe the developed ex U.S. companies in the FTSE Global Total Cap Index.Cost &amp; Other ExpensesFor ETF investors, expense ratios are an important factor when considering a fund's return; in the long-term, cheaper funds actually have the ability to outperform their more expensive cousins if all other things remain the same.Story continuesWith on par with most peer products in the space, this ETF has annual operating expenses of 0.39%.It's 12-month trailing dividend yield comes in at 1.85%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.Looking at individual holdings, H2o Retailing Corp accounts for about 0.21% of total assets, followed by Japan Airlines Ltd and Ana Holdings Inc.Its top 10 holdings account for approximately 1.81% of FNDC's total assets under management.Performance and RiskThe ETF has added roughly 7.04% and is up about 1.09% so far this year and in the past one year (as of 06/09/2023), respectively. FNDC has traded between $26.94 and $34.09 during this last 52-week period.The ETF has a beta of 0.93 and standard deviation of 17.48% for the trailing three-year period, making it a low risk choice in the space. With about 1788 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental International Small Company Index ETF is a reasonable option for investors seeking to outperform the World ETFs segment of the market. However, there are other ETFs in the space which investors could consider.Vanguard Total International Stock ETF (VXUS) tracks FTSE Global All Cap ex US Index and the Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF (VEA) tracks FTSE Developed All Cap ex US Index. Vanguard Total International Stock ETF has $56.66 billion in assets, Vanguard FTSE Developed Markets ETF has $112.51 billion. VXUS has an expense ratio of 0.07% and VEA charges 0.05%.Investors looking for cheaper and lower-risk options should consider traditional market cap weighted ETFs that aim to match the returns of the World ETFs.Bottom LineTo learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

6,f23772ed-452e-3170-b709-5c926edb80f9,UNM,2023-06-09,Earn Yourself a Steady Income With These 5 Dividend Stocks,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earn-yourself-steady-income-5-134100986.html,1686231660,STORY,"['^GSPC', 'BRDCY', 'UNM']","[If you are somebody that wants to earn a steady income through dividend distributions, you wouldn’t be alone. The general argument against dividend stocks is that they generate steady income in an inflationary market, so the value of receipts continues to depreciate. But let’s face it. Most of us draw a salary/wage of some kind, which is more or less fixed, according to the agreement with the company we work for. And we aren’t about to do away with that, are we?While opportunity is a good thing, it comes with additional risk. If we’re early in the investment business, we would be willing to take some risk. But the more mature we get, the fewer the number of years left for us to invest, the more we’re likely to want some steady income. Even for growth investors, it’s generally a good idea to dedicate a certain percentage of your portfolio to dividend stocks.But how would you choose a dividend stock? What makes these stocks special?See the goal of every dividend investor is to ensure a steady flow of income, or in other words, to minimize the chances of interruption in the dividend flow. That means, the stocks you choose should ideally be mature companies with well-established business models that have stood the test of time as well as competitive pressure. Any of the big brand companies like P&amp;G, Cisco, Caterpillar, etc. would satisfy this criterion.Second, it goes without saying that these companies should be fundamentally sound. There shouldn’t be any insurmountable legal hassle, or other headwind on the horizon. Moreover, they should be generating steady revenue, earnings and cash flow (because only if companies make money can they distribute it). Obviously, large mature companies will generate a considerable amount of cash at a more or less steady pace.Another thing that’s preferable is if they have a history of paying dividends. If a big brand company starts paying dividend, we may have a certain degree of confidence that this dividend stream will continue. However, many of us aren’t able to buy these companies at their prevailing market prices. Moreover, there may be other reasons why they may not be recommended at any given time. Therefore, this is an important point to keep in mind. If a company has a history of consistently paying dividends, it’s very likely that these payments will continue.Story continuesTo make doubly certain that the payments will continue, it also pays to consider the future growth outlook. There are a couple of ways to do this. One would be to do your own homework studying the company’s historical financial statements and management commentary. This is highly recommended. You can supplement this with the growth outlook provided by brokers. While brokers may not estimate much far out for most companies, the number may still be available in the case of some companies. So it’s worth considering.All these factors will still give you a fairly long list. And it can still be a complicated task choosing winners from this list. But it will become easier once you consider the valuation. If you overpay for a dividend stock, the return on your investment will immediately be lower. As a pointer, you can use the Zacks Style Score system, which provides a Value grade for each stock. If the grade is A or B, there’s a good chance the shares are good for the picking. To supplement, also compare its valuation on some metric of your liking (price/earnings, or P/E is a standard one) with that of the industry to which it belongs, as well as to the S&amp;P 500. Also compare with its own performance over the past year.By also ensuring that all your picks have a Zacks #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy) rating, you further increase your chances of success.Now let’s see some examples:American International Group, Inc. (AIG)American International is a large cap company, operating an insurance business since 1919.Although impacted to a certain extent by the pandemic, its earnings and cash flows have grown through most of the past five years.It has been paying a dividend for more than 20 years although there have been variations in the payout depending on business conditions. Its current dividend yields 2.29%.It is expected to grow 10.0% in the next 3-5 years.The stock carries a Value Score of A. Its P/E of 7.94X is trading at a 7.8% discount to the multi-line insurance industry to which it belongs. It is also trading at a 58.3% discount to the S&amp;P 500.Bridgestone Corporation (BRDCY)Bridgestone manufactures and sells tires and rubber products. The earnings and cash flow trends of this company are encouraging.Additionally, it has been paying a dividend for more than 20 years although here too, we see some variations in the payout. Its current dividend yields 2.33%.Analysts expect the company to grow 9.48% in the long term.The shares carry a Zacks Rank #1 and Value Score A.Bridgestone shares trade at a 10.9% discount to the industry and a 46% discount to the S&amp;P 500.Ford Motor Company (F)Ford needs no introduction.

Its current dividend is very attractive, offering a 4.64% yield.Although not as exciting as the above two, Ford’s 6.24% long-term growth estimate is nothing to scoff at.The shares carry a Zacks Rank #1 and Value Score A. They trade at a 77.4% discount to the industry and a 58.5% discount to the S&amp;P 500.Unum Group (UNM)Insurance company Unum has recovered strongly from the pandemic, generating much improved earnings and cash flow.Similar to the other three, Unum has been paying a dividend for more than 20 years.

8,72b55ceb-ee33-3c43-9e74-32e0a2e527d3,USB,2023-06-09,Should You Keep KeyCorp (KEY) on Your Radar for Solid Dividend?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/keep-keycorp-key-radar-solid-132500015.html,1686230700,STORY,"['KEY', 'USB']","[Amid the current operating backdrop, with the banking industry facing turmoil due to deposit outflows and expectations of economic slowdown/recession, solid dividend-yielding stocks are highly desirable. Today, we are discussing one such stock, KeyCorp KEY.Headquartered in Cleveland, OH, KEY is a diversified financial service provider, operating a widespread network of more than 950 branches. The bank has been increasing its quarterly dividend on a regular basis, with the last hike of 5.1% to 20.5 cents per share in November 2022.Over the past five years, KeyCorp increased the dividend four times, with an annualized dividend growth rate of 5.9%. Considering the last day’s closing price of $11.02, the company’s dividend yield currently stands at 7.44%. This is impressive compared with the industry average of 4.32% and attractive for income investors as it represents a steady income stream.KeyCorp Dividend Yield (TTM) KeyCorp Dividend Yield (TTM)KeyCorp dividend-yield-ttm | KeyCorp QuoteSo, is the KeyCorp stock worth keeping an eye on to earn a robust dividend yield? Let’s check out the company’s fundamentals to understand risk and rewards. This will help us make a proper investment decision.KeyCorp has been witnessing consistent organic growth. Though tax-equivalent revenues declined in 2019 and 2022, the same witnessed a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.1% over the last six years (2017-2022). The rise was mainly driven by solid loan and deposit balances. During the five-year period ended 2022, loans witnessed a CAGR of 7.5% and deposits saw a CAGR of 7.4%.Supported by steady loan demand and higher rates, along with KEY’s efforts to strengthen fee income, its top line is expected to keep improving. Though we project total revenues to decline 4.2% this year, it will rebound and grow 2.5% and 3.4% in 2024 and 2025, respectively. We project total net loans to grow 2% in 2023 and total deposits to rise 1%.With the Federal Reserve expected to keep interest rates high in the near term to control inflation, KeyCorp’s net interest margin (NIM) is likely to continue growing in the near term (though the pace of growth will slow down a bit on higher funding costs). We anticipate NIM to be 2.47%, 2.44% and 2.33% in 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively.Additionally, KeyCorp’s inorganic expansion efforts are impressive and have been supporting fee income growth. Last year, the company acquired GradFin, which will strengthen its digital offering capabilities. In 2021, it acquired a B2B-focused digital platform, XUP Payments and a data analytics-driven consultancy firm, AQN Strategies LLC.These, along with several past buyouts/expansion initiatives, are expected to strengthen its product suites and market share, as well as help diversify revenues.

Historically, these are bread-and-butter sellers for Target — and key profit-margin enhancers.Alleged organized crime at Target stores is also weighing on results, execs have said.And to add insult to injury, JPMorgan cut its rating on Target's stock on June 1 on a potential sales hit from the restart of student loan repayments in September.Story continues""Target over-indexes to the millennial customer and, should student loan payments come back on, the company is more exposed than others in our coverage,"" JP Morgan analyst Chris Horvers said. ""Buy-side client expectations are in the $6-8 million per month consumer outflow range should this happen, per our conversations, which represents a potential 1-2 point [comparable] headwind to retail spending.""Horvers is now at a Neutral rating on Target, similar to Citi's Lejuez.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

So what do you do if you need access to a large amount of cash and your bank is closed?@lelia_milaya / Twenty20.comHow To Make a Large Withdrawal When Your Bank Is ClosedIf you need to withdraw more money from an ATM than your maximum daily limit, you can call the bank and ask for a temporary increase in your daily allowance. Typically, you would call the number on the back for your debit card to make this request.If your bank doesn't grant your request, there are other ways to get more cash. With most banks, the maximum daily purchase amount you can make on a debit card is significantly higher than the ATM withdrawal maximum. So to get more cash, choose the cash back option when you make a purchase at the store, and request the maximum amount. If you still need more cash, you can get a cash advance from a credit card. However, this should only be used as a last resort because doing this usually comes with high fees and interest rates.$2,000 Quarter?

Wade, activist investors are pushing companies to disclose the impact new abortion rights laws could have their businesses. Yahoo Finance legal reporter Alexis Kennan breaks down what investors want to know.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, the constitutional right to abortion was revoked last year when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade. Now as we follow up on, this activist investors are pushing major companies to disclose the impact the new limitations have on their businesses. Joining us now is Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan to break it all down for us. Hey, Alexis.ALEXIS KEENAN: Hi, Rachelle. So yeah, the number of shareholder proposals that relate to abortion access, they doubled from last year's proxy season to this year's. And the number this year reached about 30. And the big takeaway here is that all of the proposals and Yahoo Finance's counted about 16 of them, all of them that went to a vote, they said no to the idea of requiring that companies explain the financial as well as reputational risks that they face now that women have no constitutional right to abortion.Now take a look at some of the companies that face these types of votes. They go across industries. Meta, Google, Costco, Home Depot, Coca-Cola, Pfizer, Walmart and Comcast as well. Comcast just had its vote yesterday. Preliminary results show also a no there to these issues.Now let's talk specifically about what these measures entail. By and large, these proposals, they sought disclosures from these companies on matters like how companies handle abortion-related customer data in response to law enforcement or potential law enforcement requests, also how their political contributions to candidates conflict with their company's stated values, also how state abortion limitations can impact hiring as well as retaining and relocating workers, and also on the other side of the issue, the potential risks of even supporting abortion.Story continuesSo altogether, Yahoo Finance reviewed about these 30 proposals that were on the table this year. Some of them though were withdrawn before a vote. And in some cases, those withdrawals can be seen as a success by their proponents because they forced companies to make some changes. And one of those is CVS. They faced a proposal, but before it went to a vote, the company agreed to provide some greater protections around their customers' health care data.But certainly this is part of a wider ESG push. But we're seeing on both sides of the political and ideological aisles here, these issues coming to a fore. But just a huge uptick this year in the number of abortion related matters on the table that doubling from last year. Just a significant, significant change despite the fact that these were virtually all no-votes so far. Rachelle?RACHELLE AKUFFO: Certainly a lot of people seeking some clarity here, at least not getting it for now. A big thank you, Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. Thanks so much.]"
17,497f2ba4-698f-4660-8ae5-20381fd43621,JWN,2023-06-09,An open letter to GameStop executive chairman Ryan Cohen: Morning Brief,Yahoo Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/an-open-letter-to-gamestop-executive-chairman-ryan-cohen-morning-brief-100037724.html,1686304837,STORY,"['GME', 'CHWY', 'AMZN', 'JWN', 'BBBYQ']","[Dear Ryan,In this former analyst’s humble opinion, you are failing mightily at GameStop and it's costing average investors major money.Do better. Way better. This is painful to watch.You have a handpicked board of directors — mostly comprised of people you worked with at Chewy. At Chewy, you created an online retailer that millions of people love. Yet, the magic you found there hasn't fixed GameStop. Some would say the business has gotten worse!First quarter 2023 sales: down 10.3% year over year. First quarter 2023 net loss: $50.5 million versus a net loss of $157.9 million a year ago.In 2022 and 2021 combined, GameStop lost $694.4 million according to your latest annual report.You failed at picking a management team and developing them based on the turnover under your kingdomship.For all his miscues, how couldn't a former Amazon exec in Matt Furlong find some form of success at GameStop? One good quarter maybe? The CFO you picked was canned in July 2022 after about a year on the job.While I am at it, why isn’t there any list of C-suite executives on the GameStop investor page? Showing these bios are standard practice for public companies.All of that's on you as a leader, Ryan.The company remains structurally challenged because of increasing digital game downloads. You still have more than 4,000 retail stores open globally despite more people buying goods and services online. Your push into NFTs failed. Your move to open more fulfillment centers has arguably failed due to top line pressures that aren't going away.Sales of collectibles — a key focus area by management — plunged 22% in the first quarter.There is still no reason for the non-gamer to enter a GameStop store. That's a problem, in my view.Of course, I have not created a huge business like you did at Chewy. Nor have I sold a large business to another company like you did when selling Chewy to Petsmart in 2017. I also haven't taken a company public, as Chewy went in 2019.Story continuesI commend you on putting in the late nights to make these things happen. I am a fan of heart and hustle stories.I also don't have the vast wealth — which you earned through Chewy! — available to me, and that means I am unable to overthrow a public company's board of directors and treat a company like a personal playground. Which is what has happened at GameStop, in my view.This bank account means you have more influence in public markets than I do, and could push around your weight. And have. Your past moves in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and Nordstrom — and bizarre tweets — show you are willing to put your money where your mouth is to make a point.It's your money, and you may choose to do with it as you see fit. We live in a capitalistic system, after all.But you are failing GameStop.And perhaps your biggest failure is the lack of communication to the average investor community.A series of 8-minute-long earnings calls the past two years led by Furlong, with no Q&amp;A? Are you kidding?Not a single investor-focused event detailing your grand plan?I get being cryptic for competitive reasons, but you are a public company executive. Investors deserve to know about the vision for a company controlled by you personally and your handpicked board.The average investor has placed a ton of faith in you, Ryan. They have spent hours upon hours reviewing GameStop's financials, supporting you on social media, and the comment sections on Yahoo Finance, among other places.It's time you show them the respect they deserve. The Ryan Cohen we talked with at Yahoo Finance in 2019 seemed to be someone that would at least entertain the thought of caring about the average guy.Be that Ryan Cohen again. Investors deserve it… and have earned it by supporting you blindly for two plus years.Note: A spokesperson for Ryan Cohen didn't return Yahoo Finance's request to make Ryan Cohen available for an interview for this piece.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

The bottom line: It was pretty disappointing.The pace of inflation came in at 4.9% year-over-year in April, while retail sales have only risen 1.6% over the past 12 months. So, the U.S. consumer is feeling the pressure caused by inflation…And as we learned from a round of retailers’ quarterly results, some are feeling the effects of cautious consumers.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, in today’s Market 360, let’s review four of these retailers’ earnings. Then, I’ll share which sector to consider investing in instead.Let’s dig in…Retailers Report Mixed ResultsNordstrom, Inc. (JWN) reported first-quarter earnings on Wednesday, May 31. The company announced earnings of $0.07 per share, up from an earnings loss of $0.06 per share in the same quarter a year ago and beating analysts’ estimates for an earnings loss of $0.08 per share. Revenue fell 11% year-over-year to $3.18 billion, but it also topped analysts’ expectations for revenue of $3.12 billion.For the fiscal first quarter, the company reported a net loss of $205 million, or $1.27 per share, compared with a net income of $20 million, or $0.13 per share, in the same quarter last year.Nordstrom also maintained its full-year outlook. It expects revenue to fall 4% to 6% but expects adjusted earnings per share between $1.80 and $2.20.In the company’s earnings release, CEO Erik Nordstrom said:We are pleased with the progress we’re making against the key priorities we laid out for 2023 as we continue to enhance our overall customer experience, improve Nordstrom Rack performance, increase inventory productivity and optimize our supply chain operations … We’re encouraged by our momentum, especially given the uncertain macroeconomic environment.Shares of the company jumped 8.1% at the market open on Thursday.Macy’s, Inc. (M) released its first-quarter earnings before the opening bell on Thursday, June 1. As I mentioned, Macy’s has experienced a customer pullback – and the company is feeling the consequences.Story continuesMacy’s reported earnings per share of $0.56 and revenue of $4.98 billion, falling 48% and 7% year-over-year, respectively. Analysts expected earnings of $0.45 per share and revenue of $5.04 billion.For the full year, the department store expects adjusted earnings per share between $2.70 and $3.20, down from the previous range of $3.67 to $4.11. The company also expects sales between $22.8 billion and $23.2 billion for the year, also down from a previous range of $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion.The company plans to invest in private brands, open more stores outside of malls, and grow its online business in the hopes of driving up sales.“We planned the year assuming that the economic health of the consumer would be challenged, but starting in late March, demand trends weakened further in our discretionary categories,” Gennette also said in the company’s earnings call. He also stated, “The US consumer, particularly at Macy’s, pulled back more than we anticipated.”Shares of the company fell nearly 6% in early trading on Thursday but bounced back in the afternoon and ended the day up 1.2%.Dollar General Corporation (DG) also reported its first-quarter earnings report Thursday morning. The company announced earnings of $2.34 per share and revenue of $9.34 billion, coming in lower than analysts’ estimates for earnings of $2.38 per share and revenue of $9.46 billion. Revenue did rise about 7% year-over-year from revenue of $8.8 billion in the same quarter last year.For its full-year outlook, Dollar General expects a 3.5% to 5% rise in net sales, down from the previous guidance of 5.5% to 6%. Earnings per share are expected to remain flat or reach a loss of 8% from the year before, compared to company management’s previous projection for a 4% to 6% rise.The discount retailer is pulling back in its expansion of pOpshelf stores (where all merchandise is rounded up to whole numbers), expecting now to only open 90 stores instead of the originally projected 150. The company planned on opening a total of 1,050 new stores in fiscal year 2023 but is now only planning to open 990.CEO Jeff Owen said in the company’s earnings release:While the macroeconomic environment has been more challenging than expected, particularly for our core customer, we are confident in Dollar General’s ability to deliver strong growth in the years ahead, despite the near-term pressure which impacted our first quarter sales results and is anticipated to impact our full-year sales and EPS … We are controlling what we can control and have made significant progress improving our execution on multiple fronts, including on our supply chain recovery efforts and enhancements to the customer experience with our previously announced investment in incremental labor hours.DG fell more than 20% to a new 52-week low of $159.12 following its earnings report on Thursday.Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LULU) released its first-quarter earnings Thursday afternoon. The company reported earnings of $2.28 per share, up 54% from earnings of $1.48 per share in the same quarter last year. Revenue increased 24% year-over-year to $2 billion, up from $1.61 billion a year ago. Analysts expected earnings per share of $1.98 and revenue of $1.93 billion, so the company beat analysts’ expectations on both the top and bottom lines.In the earnings release, Chief Financial Officer Meghan Frank said, “A meaningful acceleration in our China sales trend, coupled with lower air freight, contributed to our better-than-planned financial performance.”Lululemon also increased its revenue and earnings outlook for the full year. The company anticipates revenue to be between $9.44 billion and $9.51 billion, up from previous guidance for revenue of $9.31 billion to $9.41 billion. It also expects full-year earnings to be between $11.74 and $11.94 per share, up from its previous range of $11.50 to $11.72 per share.Shares of Lululemon surged more than 12% on Friday.Where to Invest InsteadThe retail sector has been hurting in the past year; the SPDR S&amp;P Retail ETF (XRT), which tracks retail stocks, is down 2.8%, as I write.Another sector, on the other hand, is booming: tech.The tech-heavy NASDAQ has been outperforming the other major indices this year. As I write this, the NASDAQ is up 26%, while the S&amp;P 500 has gained 12% and the Dow has climbed about 2%.The NASDAQ has been getting a strong push from mega-cap and artificial intelligence (AI)-related stocks, namely Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) and NVIDIA Corp. (NVDA).However, if you’re considering tech stocks, you always want to make sure you’re invested in fundamentally superior companies that consistently grow their earnings – like the companies on my Growth Investor Buy List.I’ve taken steps to align my Growth Investor Buy Lists to prosper in multiple corners of the market, as well as the current AI craze, by “locking and loading” my Buy Lists with stocks with accelerating earnings and sales momentum.If you become a Growth Investor member, you’ll have access to my newest recommendations, as well as my two Buy Lists: High-Growth Investments and Elite Dividend Payers.

24,913c070b-323e-3a4d-900a-5839c4fd8dbc,MET,2023-06-09,11 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-health-insurance-stocks-115951551.html,1686311991,STORY,"['HUM', 'UNH', 'CNC', 'MOH', 'PGR', 'WTW', 'MET', 'CVS', 'BHG']","[In this article we present the list of 11 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), and CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) are a few of the best health insurance stocks to buy now according to some of the most successful money managers in the world.The healthcare industry is one of the strongest safe havens during lean economic periods, as personal health is one of the few things most people are unwilling to compromise on, regardless of the costs. That was certainly evident in 2022, as the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund greatly outperformed the Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500, and Dow Jones.According to the American Medical Association, healthcare industry spending rose by 2.7% in 2021 to hit $4.26 trillion, which accounted for over 18% of U.S. GDP. That latter figure is twice as high as the OECD average when it comes to healthcare costs as a percentage of GDP, which underlines the vital importance of health insurance in the U.S.As healthcare costs in the country have ballooned, making it all but unaffordable out-of-pocket, health insurance has become an absolute necessity. Private health insurance covered $1.21 trillion worth of that $4.26 trillion in healthcare spending in 2021, more than Medicare and Medicaid, while just $433 billion in healthcare costs were paid out-of-pocket. Overall, more than 300 million Americans had some form of at least partial health insurance in 2022, a 40% increase since 1990.Thanks to rising interest rates, the best health insurance stocks to buy have been among the top performing healthcare stocks in the world, with many leaders in the industry raking in record profits in 2022. In the third quarter, Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), and Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC) all grew their quarterly profits by at least 26% year-over-year. In contrast, many of the biggest health system providers like HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) were seeing their profits implode, with HCA’s down 50% year-over-year.Story continuesThat growing profit divide between payers and providers makes the best health insurance stocks to buy some of the most attractive in the entire healthcare industry. Check out the 15 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now for some of the other top names in healthcare that hedge funds are bullish on.With their profits reaching new heights, the best insurance stocks for dividends are also becoming more attractive on the basis of their yields. While they don’t match up to the yields of many of the 14 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks to Buy, their payouts have been growing and in some cases they boast yields that now top 3%.Both fairly-valued and undervalued insurance stocks alike will have plenty of room to grow in the future, as the global health insurance market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.9% between 2022 and 2030 according to Straits Research, hitting $5.28 trillion by 2030. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the fastest-growing during that period, at a 13.8% CAGR, which gives U.S. health insurers that operate in the region, like Cigna, huge growth opportunities.11 Best Health Insurance Stocks to BuyStokkete/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe following best health insurance stocks to buy are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.11 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy11. Bright Health Group, Inc. (NYSE:BHG)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 6 CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) are some of the biggest health insurers in the world and have the hedge fund backing to prove it. One of the lesser known insurers on the market, and by far the least popular of the 11 best health insurance stocks to buy is Bright Health Group, Inc. (NYSE:BHG).Just six hedge funds were long Bright Health Group, Inc. (NYSE:BHG) on March 31, down 75% from the second quarter of 2021, when the Tiger Global-backed insurer first went public through an IPO. Tiger Global has since unloaded its stake in the company, as has another Tiger Cub, Lee Ainslie of Maverick Capital. The stock’s lone significant bull is Jose Fernandez’s Stepstone Group, which owns just over 42 million shares.It’s no wonder hedge funds have bailed on the stock, as Bright Health Group, Inc. (NYSE:BHG) has been in a world of hurt and facing serious liquidity concerns. As a result, the company is exploring the sale of its California Medicare Advantage business. RBC Capital lowered its price target on BHG to $13 from $80 at the end of May, while Goldman Sachs suspended its rating on the company in March (it previously had a ‘Sell’ rating on the stock), citing insufficient information in the company’s Q4 earnings report.10. Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 41 Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) pushed to a new all-time high in hedge fund ownership during the first quarter of 2023 as several funds added the company to their 13F portfolios during the quarter. Among them were Jeffrey Talpins’ Element Capital Management and Alec Litowitz and Ross Laser’s Magnetar Capital.It might surprise some people to know that Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) is the seventh-largest public health insurer in the world with 5.3 million members. While the company’s revenue and membership growth rates each came in at less than 5% year-over-year in Q1, EPS rose by 25.7% to $5.52. Analysts also expect Molina to have one of the best earnings growth rates in the industry over the next five years at a projected 17.8% annually.Carillon Tower Advisers noted the bear case on Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) has been at least partially debunked according to the firm’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) also performed well as sentiment toward health maintenance organizations improved, both as a relatively defensive investment during uncertain times, and as the bear case on the stock was partially debunked with an extension of expanded enrollment for government health insurance programs.”9. Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 42 Unlike Molina Healthcare, hedge funds have been bailing on Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW) over the last year-and-a-half, with smart money ownership of the stock falling by 43% during that time. Jeffrey Smith’s Starboard Value took a stake at the height of the company’s hedge fund popularity but has maintained it since then and noted at the time that the company has underperformed but that it’s also undervalued.Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW), which provides a broad range of insurance products to clients, has undergone numerous transformation initiatives in recent years. The company’s results are steadily improving, with free cash flow, margins, and organic revenue all rising, but the improvements have been slower than expected in some areas. Raymond James recently lowered its price target on WTW to $270 from $275 on the expectations that the company is likely to miss its 2024 revenue and earnings targets.Artisan Partners likes the progress Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW) is making in closing the results gap to its peers, as noted in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW) shares rose 2% in the quarter. This modest increase made it one of our best performers during a difficult quarter. Absent significant news, the business continues to benefit from a hard insurance market. Results are still lagging peers, but the management team seems to be making progress in closing the gap. In the meantime, the company is returning significant amounts of capital to shareholders. Over the past eight months, it has repurchased $4 billion in stock and reduced the share count by 15%. And there is more on the way. This is a good business in a fantastic industry trading at 12X normalized earnings. We believe it is worth much more.”8. MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 43 MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) is nearly as popular with hedge funds today as it was back in 2014, but smart money sentiment has gradually inched up since the final quarter of 2018, when just 25 funds were long MET. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment raised its stake in MetLife by 2,962% during Q1, giving it nearly 1.52 million shares by the end of the quarter.While many health insurers have been enjoying big earnings boosts in recent quarters, that wasn’t the case for MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) in Q1. Adjusted earnings fell by 30% year-over-year and widely missed estimates, while revenue dipped by 9% to $11.5 billion.Analysts are bullish on MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)’s $19.2 billion reinsurance agreement however, with RBC Capital analyst Mark Dwelle noting that it frees up capital, improves the company’s RBC ratio, and will allow it to execute incremental share buybacks. On the latter front, MetLife announced alongside the risk transfer transaction that it will indeed raise its share buyback allowance by a billion dollars to $4 billion.7. Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 61 There’s been a greater than 20% increase in the number of funds long Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC) over the past six quarters with the company in the midst of various transformation initiatives under new leadership. Stephen Dubois’ Camber Capital Management and Marc Majzner’s Clearline Capital are among the funds that added CNC to their 13F portfolios during Q1.Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC)’s medical membership climbed to 28.5 million in the first quarter, an 8.5% increase year-over-year. Its adjusted diluted EPS growth of 15.3% was also strong, though analysts expect a more modest 10.6% annual boost on that front over the next five years, less than the projected earnings growth for the broader industry. Partly due to those muted earnings expectations, CNC shares trade at a forward P/E of just 10.4x, well below the industry average.The Heartland Mid Cap Value Fund is bullish on the steps Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC)’s new management is undertaking to improve efficiency, as relayed in the fund’s Q1 2023 investor letter:“Health Care. During the quarter, we added to our existing position in Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC), one of the largest managed health care insurance providers in the U.S. and the largest player in Medicaid.The stock has underperformed lately, as CNC faces headwinds on the reimbursement front, including a reduction in its 2024 Medicare Advantage reimbursements. The market also seems to fear a potential loss of insured lives when Medicaid eligibility, which was expanded during the pandemic, gets redetermined in 2023-2024.CNC hasn’t historically delivered consistent results compared to other premier managed care companies. More recently, the company upgraded its leadership ranks, including the addition of a CEO, CFO, and COO from better-managed companies with a track record of value creation. The company is undertaking a series of self-help efforts, including expense reductions, divesting noncore assets, share buybacks, and operational improvements.Despite this, the stock trades at just 10 times 2023 earnings and 9 times 2024 profits. We consider that valuation too punitive for a company that we expect to continue growing EPS at a 12-15% compound annual growth rate.”6. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 64 Hedge fund ownership of The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) skyrocketed by more than 50% between the middle of 2021 and the end of 2022, hitting an all-time high at the end of last year. It took a dip in the latest quarter however, with several funds unloading their PGR stakes after a nice run for the stock, which gained 45% between the start of 2022 and the end of March 2023.The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) shares have dipped this year partly due to the surprising uptick in the company’s combined ratio during Q1, which rose to 99%. However, that appears to be primarily due to litigation laws involving lawsuits against insurers being updated in Florida, which led to a temporary surge in lawsuits being brought against insurers before the new laws were passed. Given its lengthy history of having a market-leading combined ratio, it shouldn’t be long before Progressive gets that figure back below its target mark of 96%.The Ariel Appreciation Fund succinctly detailed why it sold off The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) in the fund’s Q1 2023 investor letter:“Meanwhile, we successfully exited personal auto insurer, The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) as it surpassed our estimate of its private market value.” Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) are some of the top insurers in the world that hedge funds love.

U.S. stock futures fell 0.1%, indicating some softness after the S&amp;P 500 entered a technical bull market the day before.Traders now lay 73% odds on the Fed keeping rates steady on June 14, in a range of 5%-5.25%, pausing its most aggressive hiking cycle since the 1980s.Bets for a pause were supported by data on Thursday that showed the number of Americans filing new jobless claims surged to a more than 1 1/2-year high, indicating a loosening labour market that could further quell inflation.Investors also hope the Fed will pause its rate rise campaign as a quirk of the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations has posed a potential a threat to market liquidity.The U.S. government is expected to rush to sell short term debt to replenish its Treasury General Account, potentially at yields so high that banks raise deposit rates to compete for funding, reducing interest in riskier assets like equities.""We're all worried about liquidity,"" said Ben Jones, director of macro research at Invesco. The Fed, he added, ""still wants to tighten,"" policy and therefore may allow the TGA rebuild to drain liquidity from markets without stepping in to provide other support tools.This fear was not dominating trading on Friday, however.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on May 19 it was still unclear if U.S. interest rates will need to rise further, and the risks of overtightening or undertightening had become more balanced.Story continuesYIELDS UPTwo-year Treasury yields, which are extremely sensitive to monetary policy expectations, rose about 4 basis points (bps) to around 4.56%. The 10-year yield edged up 4 bps to 3.753%.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the performance of the U.S. currency against six others, rebounded 0.2% to 103.52.The euro slipped 0.14% to $1.0765, just below Thursday's two-week high of $1.0787.Elsewhere, the Turkish lira extended its decline to a new record low of 23.54 per dollar, even as President Tayyip Erdogan's appointment of a U.S. banker as central bank chief sent a strong signal for a return to more orthodox policy.Erdogan had last week put well-regarded former finance minister Mehmet Simsek back in the post. Simsek said this week that the guiding principles for the economy would be transparency, consistency, accountability and predictability.Leading crypto asset bitcoin briefly dipped before recovering to trade 0.4% firmer at $26,603 after crypto exchange Binance said it was suspending dollar deposits and would soon pause fiat currency withdrawal channels following a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission crackdown.Crude oil edged higher but gains were tempered by a report that the United States and Iran were close to a nuclear deal, although denials from both parties kept it off the previous session's lows.The prospect of a deal, which reportedly included scope for an additional 1 million barrels per day of Iranian supply, initially dented crude prices.Brent crude futures fell by as much as 0.9% at one point, before reversing course to last trade up 0.3% at $76.20 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude was up 0.3% at $71.50 a barrel.(Reporting by Naomi Rovnick and Kevin Buckland; Editing by Gerry Doyle, Andrew Heavens and Chizu Nomiyama)]"

He announced the output cut after the meeting, calling it a ""Saudi lollipop"".Four OPEC+ sources, who were among their countries' delegations involved in policy talks, said they only heard details of the Saudi cut at the Sunday evening news conference – and that the idea of a cut didn't come up during a weekend of discussions on a broader deal to limit supply into 2024.""No information on the additional cut was shared prior to the press conference,"" one of the four sources said. ""It was a surprise one, once again.""Saudi Arabia said it would cut output in July by 10% or 1 million barrels per day (bpd) to 9 million bpd and may extend cuts further if needed. Meanwhile, OPEC+ agreed to extend cuts into 2024 but didn't commit to any fresh cuts in 2023.OPEC+, which groups the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies led by Russia, pumps around 40% of the world's crude.As well as the Saudi cut, OPEC+ lowered its collective production target for 2024 and the nine participating countries extended the April voluntary cuts to the end of 2024.Story continuesThe United Arab Emirates secured a higher output quota that it had long been seeking - an issue that has caused tension between the group and Abu Dhabi, which has been increasing its output capacity.The Saudi Energy Ministry and OPEC's Vienna headquarters did not respond to requests for comment.'CAN'T PUSH THE OTHERS'In the days leading up to the June 4 meeting, two other OPEC+ sources said there was an idea for more cuts by OPEC+ states, although this did not proceed to advanced discussions in Vienna.Saudi Arabia, other OPEC+ sources said, recognised it would be difficult to secure cuts from others such as the UAE and Russia, which according to sources in the days before the meeting was reluctant to cut output further.""The Saudis were cognizant this time they could not push the others,"" an OPEC+ source said. ""The UAE are happy with the new quota and it is a big relief for the Saudis.""Still, Saudi Arabia did manage to persuade other members of OPEC+ that have been unable to produce at required levels due to lack of investment in capacity - notably Nigeria and Angola - to accept lower production targets for 2024 after long meetings.Prince Abdulaziz told Al Arabiya after the meeting the group was tired of giving quotas to countries that were unable to produce them and that Russia needed to be transparent about its output and exports levels.OPEC+ sources said the new targets for Angola and Nigeria were still higher than the countries can realistically pump, which means they do not have to perform real cuts.Russia, whose exports have stayed strong despite Western sanctions, also avoided having to make a further reduction.It is unclear if Saudi Arabia hinted about its possible voluntary cut to some officials in Russia or the African producers to help persuade them to agree a broader deal.Nonetheless, all those producers stand to benefit if they can keep output the same or pump a bit more, especially if the Saudi cut boosts prices.The Saudi cut could also give the kingdom more leverage in coming months to pressure countries that are not cutting output and yet benefit from others' cuts, one OPEC+ source said.""To avoid free rider behaviour, Saudi Arabia could threaten to put 1 million bpd back on the market within 30 days, which would lead to a drop in prices,"" another OPEC+ source said. He did not name which countries this might be directed at.So far, oil prices have risen slightly following the Saudi plan. Brent crude is trading higher than $77 on Thursday, up from Friday's close just above $76.""Saudi cuts are playing second fiddle to worries about the state of the global economy,"" said Stephen Brennock of oil broker PVM, although he added the Saudi cut could widen a supply deficit in July.""Accordingly, it will take a brave man to bet against an eventual uptick in prices.""(Additional reporting by Rowena Edwards, Maha El Dahan and Olesya Astakhova; Editing by Simon Webb and David Evans)]"

The sector had soared 7.3% over the past week on speculation of impending stimulus from Beijing, which has yet to materialise.On Wall Street overnight, gains were led by the tech-heavy Nasdaq, which surged 1.27%. The broader S&amp;P 500 rose 0.62%. E-mini U.S. equity futures in Asia pointed to about a 0.1% lower restart for each of the indexes.Traders now lay 73% odds for the Fed to keep rates steady on June 14, versus 27% probability of a quarter-point increase. However, the market sees an increase as mostly assured by the July 26 decision, putting the chance at about 80%.Bets for a pause were supported by data overnight showing the number of Americans filing new jobless claims surged to a more than 1 1/2-year high.Still, some analysts point to surprise rate increases at the Bank of Canada and Reserve Bank of Australia this week as reasons not to be complacent.""I wouldn't go all in and say we're going to get a rate hike, but I think we should be at least 50% priced,"" said Tony Sycamore, an analyst at IG Markets in Sydney.""I know people can point to Fed Chair (Jerome) Powell's comments as being more supportive of a hold than a hike, but there have been some interesting developments since he last spoke,"" Sycamore added. ""I can't imagine he'd be happy by the increase in core PCE inflation, nor the robust gain in non-farm payrolls.""Story continuesPowell said on May 19 that it was still unclear if U.S. interest rates will need to rise further, and the risks of overtightening or undertightening had become more balanced.Two-year Treasury yields, which are extremely sensitive to monetary policy expectations, were little changed at around 4.53% in Tokyo after a 3 basis-point (bp) decline by the New York close. The 10-year yield edged up to 3.73% after tumbling 7 bps overnight.The U.S. dollar index, which measures the currency against a basket of six major peers, rebounded 0.09% to 103.41, but still close to the low of 103.29 reached on Thursday, a level last seen on May 23.The dollar added 0.3% to 139.355 yen, after earlier slipping to a one-week low of 138.765.The euro was about flat at $1.0777, just below Thursday's two-week high of $1.0787.Elsewhere, the Turkish lira extended its decline to a new record low of 23.54 per dollar, even as President Tayyip Erdogan's appointment of a U.S. banker as central bank chief sent a fresh signal for a return to more orthodox policy.Erdogan had last week put well-regarded former finance minister Mehmet Simsek back in the post, and Simsek said this week that the guiding principles in the economy will be transparency, consistency, accountability and predictability.""The market needs to see it to believe it,"" said Rodrigo Catril, senior currency strategist at National Australia Bank. ""Investors are choosing to shoot first and ask questions later.""Leading cryptocurrency bitcoin briefly dipped by 0.83% before recovering to be little changed at $26,484 after Binance, the world's biggest cryptocurrency exchange,saidit was suspending dollar deposits and would soon pause fiat withdrawal channels as a result of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)'s crackdown.Crude oil remained on the back foot on Friday after a report that the United States and Iran were close to a nuclear deal, although denials from both parties kept it off the previous session's lows.Optimism for a deal, which reportedly included scope for an additional 1 million barrels per day of Iranian production, had knocked down West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude by $3.50 to just shy of $69 at one point on Thursday.WTI futures were last 58 cents weaker than Thursday's close at $70.71.

The country used to be OPEC's second-largest producing country, so any deal to lift export sanctions could seriously impact the current oil supply dynamic.Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia needs higher oil prices to help sustain its high rate of spending on mega projects, with some estimates suggesting the country needs prices above $81 per barrel to breakeven on its current budget plans. And Russia needs higher oil prices to help fund its war on Ukraine.But the White House denied reports that it was nearing a deal with Iran for it to curb its uranium enrichment in exchange for some relief in sanctions.""This report is false and misleading,"" a spokesperson for the White House National Security Council said.West Texas Intermediate crude prices pared losses to about 1.5% following the denial from the White House to $71.53 per barrel.The US and other world powers entered into the Iran nuclear deal during the Obama administration to freeze Tehran's weapons program.

It finished higher 0.1%, the best close since Aug. 16. The Nasdaq Composite added 0.13%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.16%.Over in Europe, the STOXX 600 index lost 0.13%, but MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan jumped 0.74% overnight. Combined with gains on Wall Street, the MSCI's broadest index of world stocks added 0.18% at a 13-month high. For the week, the index for world stocks might notch a 0.6% rise.""As of today, the S&amp;P 500 is back in a bull market,"" said Arthur Hogan, chief market strategist at Briley Wealth, noting that the index finished Thursday with a 20% gain off its recent lows. ""The one thing that could tip over the apple cart is an over-aggressive Fed.""Refinitiv data showed the S&amp;P 500 up 20% from its Oct. 12 closing low. The most commonly accepted definition of a bull market is a 20% rise off a low, and a 20% decline from a high for a bear market, but that is open to interpretation.Traders now lay 73% odds on the Fed keeping rates steady on June 14, in a range of 5%-5.25%, pausing its most aggressive hiking cycle since the 1980s.Bets for a pause were supported by data on Thursday that showed the number of Americans filing new jobless claims surged to a more than 1 1/2-year high, indicating a loosening labour market that could further quell inflation.Investors also hope the Fed will pause its rate rise campaign as a quirk of the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations has posed a potential threat to market liquidity.The U.S. government is expected to rush to sell short-term debt to replenish its Treasury General Account (TGA), potentially at yields so high that banks raise deposit rates to compete for funding, reducing interest in riskier assets like equities.Story continues""We're all worried about liquidity,"" said Ben Jones, director of macro research at Invesco. The Fed, he added, ""still wants to tighten"" policy and therefore may allow the TGA rebuild to drain liquidity from markets without stepping in to provide other support tools.This fear was not dominating trading on Friday, however.Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on May 19 it was still unclear whether U.S. interest rates will need to rise further, and the risks of overtightening or undertightening had become more balanced.YIELDS UPUncertainty about the U.S. rates outlook supported Treasury yields.Two-year Treasury yields, which are extremely sensitive to monetary policy expectations, rose to 4.602%, while the yield on benchmark 10-year notes US10YT=RR climbed to 3.743%.

(NYSE: FE) subsidiary, is completing inspections and conducting proactive equipment maintenance across its 31-county northern and central Pennsylvania service area to help enhance service reliability for customers.Penelec Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)""We proactively inspect and maintain our equipment to help ensure our system is prepared for increased electrical demand when temperatures soar,"" said Scott Wyman, president of FirstEnergy's Pennsylvania operations. ""These important steps help to minimize the length and impact of service interruptions should summer storms cause power outages.""Penelec crews are wrapping up inspections of its local energy delivery system to ensure electrical equipment is ready to perform reliably with elevated summer electrical demand, typically due to air conditioning usage.Substation electricians use thermovision cameras during summer-readiness inspections to capture infrared images, helping to detect potential problems within substations and on power lines that cannot be observed during regular visual inspections. These images can identify equipment issues such as loose connections, corrosion and load imbalances, and utility workers are able to make repairs to prevent potential power outages in the future.In addition, helicopter patrols have completed inspections of more than 2,500 miles of power lines owned by Mid-Atlantic Interstate Transmission, LLC (MAIT), a FirstEnergy transmission subsidiary, located in the Penelec area. The inspections are designed to look for damaged wire, broken cross arms and other hardware problems not visible from the ground. Any potential reliability issues identified during the inspections will be addressed.Penelec is also trimming trees in communities across its eastern Pennsylvania service area. Maintaining proper clearances around electrical equipment can help reduce the frequency and duration of tree-related power outages, especially those associated with severe weather. Since the beginning of the year, tree contractors have trimmed along about 1,600 miles of power lines in the Penelec service area and remain on schedule to complete an additional 2,200 miles of work by year end.Story continuesA team of Penelec and FirstEnergy employees will be conducting storm readiness exercises and drills in the near future to test Penelec's restoration process used to repair storm-related power outages. Storm drills are becoming more common in the utility industry in the wake of severe weather over the last several years.With the summer storm season also comes higher-than-usual temperatures and rising energy costs. Customers can take steps to beat the heat while also managing their electricity bill this summer. The following tips can help customers use electricity wisely during this period of high demand:Set thermostats as high as comfort will allow. Every degree a customer can increase the temperature in their home will result in using about 3% less energy during the summer.Use fans – moving air cools skin faster, resulting in greater comfort on hot days.During sunny weather, close drapes or blinds on windows facing the sun to prevent direct radiant heating from impacting interior temperatures.Use a programmable or smart thermostat to keep temperatures higher when no one is home and to reduce the temperature before arrival back home.Seal any leaks with caulk or weather stripping to prevent hot air from sneaking into your home.Check air conditioner and furnace fan filters. Clogged filters waste energy and money by forcing HVAC systems to work harder than necessary.Avoid using heat-producing appliances during the hottest hours of the day.

(NYSE: FE) subsidiary Penn Power recently completed proactive equipment inspections and maintenance to reinforce the electric system against extreme heat and severe weather this summer. The work builds upon vast equipment and technology upgrades Penn Power has made to its electric grid in western Pennsylvania over recent years to help prevent power outages and reduce many interruptions to just a brief or momentary outage.Penn Power Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)""We proactively inspect, maintain and upgrade our equipment to minimize the length and impact of service interruptions that are often caused by events out of our control, like severe weather,"" said Scott Wyman, president of FirstEnergy's Pennsylvania operations. ""In the past year alone, FirstEnergy invested more than $20 million in new automated technology and equipment upgrades across the Penn Power service area to help keep power flowing to our customers in all types of weather conditions.""Since the fall, Penn Power personnel have installed more than 30 new automated reclosing devices in the substations and along power lines in its service area to help limit the frequency, duration and scope of service interruptions.These electrical devices work like a circuit breaker in a home that shuts off power when trouble occurs, with the added benefit of automatically reenergizing a substation or power line within seconds for certain types of outages to keep power safely flowing to customers. This technology is safer and more efficient because it often allows utility personnel to automatically restore service to customers in lieu of sending a crew to investigate.If the device senses a more serious issue, like a fallen tree on electrical equipment, it will isolate the outage to that area and limit the total number of affected customers. The device's smart technology will quickly pinpoint the location of the fault and help utility personnel better understand the cause of the outage to help speed restoration.Story continuesMore than a dozen automated voltage regulators were also installed to help ensure safe, constant voltage levels along power lines on extremely hot or cold days that create high demand for electricity. In addition to preventing voltage issues for customers, the devices could potentially help provide energy savings by evenly distributing electricity to allow all customers served by a single power line to receive the same flow of safe, reliable power.Other work being completed by Penn Power personnel includes inspecting electrical equipment, like transformers, located along neighborhood power lines and within substations to ensure the infrastructure is ready to perform reliably when demand for electricity increases during the summer, typically due to air conditioning usage.Proactive equipment inspections include using thermovision cameras to capture infrared images of electrical equipment, helping detect potential problems within substations and on power lines that cannot be observed during regular visual inspections. The infrared technology shows heat on a color scale, with brighter colors or ""hot spots"" indicating areas that could need repairs. These images can identify equipment issues such as loose connections, corrosion and load imbalances, and utility workers are able to make repairs to prevent potential power outages in the future.In addition, helicopter patrols have completed inspections of nearly 750 miles of high-voltage power lines owned by American Transmission Systems, Inc., a FirstEnergy transmission subsidiary, located in the Penn Power service area.

(NYSE: FE), is completing equipment inspections, preventive maintenance and tree-trimming work across its Maryland service territory to help reduce potential weather-related outages and improve reliability for customers this summer.Mon Power Logo (PRNewsfoto/FirstEnergy Corp.)""The proactive inspections and maintenance we conduct are a key part of improving service reliability and keeping our customers comfortable as temperatures rise this summer,"" said Linda Moss, president of FirstEnergy's Maryland operations. ""Running air conditioners and fans to stay cool during the summer months creates extra pressure on the electric grid, and our preparation work helps ensure a safe and constant flow of electricity.""Helicopter crews have inspected more than 590 miles of transmission lines located in Potomac Edison's Maryland service territory. The inspections are designed to look for damaged wire, broken crossarms, failed insulators and other hardware problems not visible from the ground. Potential reliability issues identified during the inspection will be prioritized and addressed as quickly as possible.On the ground, Potomac Edison personnel inspected approximately 80 substations earlier this spring and completed needed repairs prior to the summer. Thermovision cameras were used to capture infrared images that can reveal potential problems with equipment. By identifying hot spots, maintenance and repairs can be completed before a power outage occurs. WATCH: FirstEnergy uses infrared thermography to enhance service reliability.Crews also conducted thorough inspections along neighborhood power lines and focused on more than 450 line capacitors in Maryland that maintain proper electric voltage. These devices are especially useful in remote locations because they automatically adjust voltage levels to accommodate changing system conditions.Story continuesTo help minimize the impact of tree-related damages during severe weather, tree contractors plan to clear vegetation along approximately 1,100 miles of power lines in 2023 to help enhance electric service reliability for Potomac Edison customers in Maryland. They have already completed that work along around 500 miles of power lines this spring.As part of the company's investment in vegetation management this year, trees have been inspected and pruned in a manner that helps preserve the health of the tree while maintaining safe clearances near electrical equipment. In some cases, trees that present a danger or are diseased may be removed.  Similar work will be performed along hundreds of miles of the company's high-voltage transmission power lines in Maryland.With the summer storm season also comes higher-than-usual temperatures and rising energy costs.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Big Name Stocks to Buy Now.The US economy and big business giants have a closely intertwined relationship, with these large corporations playing a significant role in shaping the economic landscape. They contribute to the growth of the US economy by driving productivity, innovation, and job creation. These companies invest heavily in research and development, which leads to the development of new technologies, products, and services. Their investments in capital infrastructure and expansion projects stimulate economic activity and create employment opportunities, supporting economic growth at both the national and local levels.Big companies are major employers, providing a significant number of jobs across a wide range of industries. They create both direct and indirect employment opportunities, contributing to lower unemployment rates and promoting economic stability. These companies often offer competitive wages, benefits, and career advancement opportunities, attracting a skilled workforce and enhancing labor market dynamics. Big business giants also have extensive supply chains, encompassing numerous suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and service providers. Their purchasing power and demands can influence the operations and growth of their supply chain partners. As a result, these companies have the ability to support and shape the growth of smaller businesses within their supply chains, contributing to job creation and economic development. Many big companies are multinational corporations that operate globally. Their international operations contribute to the US economy through exports, foreign direct investment, and global market expansion. Their ability to compete globally enhances the competitiveness of the US economy, supporting trade and generating economic gains.Story continuesSurprisingly, the US economy is currently in a healthy state, considering the challenges it has faced, including the global pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and the impact of a war on a major global energy supplier. The labor market conditions alone provide strong support for the belief that the economy can achieve a desired soft landing, which is not uncommon despite claims suggesting otherwise. Although inflation remains a concern, it is much less worrisome than it was a year ago. If US policymakers can avoid any detrimental policy decisions, such as failing to raise the debt ceiling, the outlook is positive that the economy will continue to innovate, generate employment opportunities, and produce goods and services after a few quarters of slower growth. According to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, the current-account deficit of the United States decreased by $12.2 billion, or 5.6%, to reach $206.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. The revised deficit for the third quarter was $219.0 billion. In terms of current-dollar gross domestic product (GDP), the fourth-quarter deficit accounted for 3.2%, which was a decline from 3.4% recorded in the third quarter.The US economy experienced a slowdown in the early months of 2023, with a growth rate of 1.1% on an annual basis. This decline in growth can be attributed to higher interest rates and a banking crisis that had a negative impact on various sectors. The Bureau of Economic Analysis released these latest figures, indicating a significant deceleration at a time when concerns about a recession are already looming, partly due to worries that the banking sector's challenges will restrict lending. In comparison, the US economy had grown at an annual rate of 2.6% during the last quarter of 2022. However, households continue to increase their spending, particularly on services like entertainment and travel, driven by pent-up demand. Business investment remains strong, especially in information-processing equipment and software. Some of the best big name stocks to monitor in this context include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Atlassian Corporation Plc (NASDAQ:TEAM), and Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM). However, investment in nonresidential structures remains weak due to an oversupply of office buildings and retail spaces. The housing market experiences a true recession, with a significant slump. Economic experts believe inflation will gradually settle back by late 2023 as demand for goods slows and businesses address their supply chain issues. However, this decline in inflation might be temporary as wages rise due to the continued strength of the labor market, leading to higher costs and prices. The Federal Reserve, despite its attempts to control inflation in 2022, has found it challenging to slow down the hot labor market enough to have a significant impact, resulting in inflation settling at approximately 6%. Nominal interest rates have reached levels that would have been considered burdensome a few years ago, but the overall economic activity remains relatively strong. Our MethodologyFor this article, we selected big name stocks and ranked them based on overall hedge fund sentiment. Big name stocks are companies that have global brand capital and more than 100 hedge fund holders. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the first quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. 10 Best Big Name Stocks to Buy NowBest Big Name Stocks to Buy Now10. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 116 UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) operates as a diversified healthcare firm.

For the past two decades, the company has consistently paid a dividend to shareholders. These payouts have registered consistent growth in the past thirteen years. On June 7, the firm declared a quarterly dividend of $1.88 per share, an increase of close to 14% from the previous dividend of $1.65 per share. On May 30, JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill maintained an Overweight rating on UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) stock and lowered the price target to $562 from $595, updating models across the managed care coverage. At the end of the first quarter of 2023, 116 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $11.7 billion in UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), compared to 110 in the preceding quarter worth $11.4 billion. Just like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Atlassian Corporation Plc (NASDAQ:TEAM), and Zoom Video Communications, Inc.

Here is what the fund said:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) also contributed to performance during the quarter. United’s operating income grew +3% on difficult year-ago comparisons as benefits members utilized more services compared to last year. Optum Health grew operating income +40% as more patients are enrolled in the Company’s value-based care services. The Company estimates nearly a third of all medical care is unnecessary and represents an opportunity to capture savings for both patients. Optum’s integrated platform of patient data, IT, and service providers are focused on driving out these unnecessary costs and should serve as the engine for long-term, mid-teens earnings per share growth.”9. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) provides technology infrastructure and marketing reach to help merchants, brands, retailers, and other businesses to engage with their users and customers in the People's Republic of China and internationally. It is one of the best big name stocks to buy now. The company, like other tech competitors, is trying hard to capture the AI market. Recent reports suggest that the firm intends to incorporate a ChatGPT-like artificial intelligence technology into its meeting and messaging applications, aiming to enhance user experiences and communication efficiency. On April 23, Susquehanna analyst Shyam Patil maintained a Positive rating on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) stock and lowered the price target to $160 from $175, noting that Chinese macro appears to have improved somewhat and cost discipline continues to pay off.At the end of the first quarter of 2023, 128 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $5.8 billion in Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), compared to 113 in the preceding quarter worth $5.6 billion. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Polen Capital, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is the leading e-commerce company in China. The stock was weak over the quarter as they reported a quarterly revenue decline. The company has been heavily impacted by the continued covid-19 lockdowns throughout China and the aggressive rate increases and a deteriorating outlook for China’s economy have weighed heavily on the stock. The share price has also been under pressure due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s plans to delist Chinese tech stocks in 2024 if they do not provide access to audit files.”8. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 136   Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) provides customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide. It is one of the best big name stocks to buy now. On June 7, the firm announced that it was partnering with Google Cloud in a collaboration that will enable companies to leverage their data and utilize custom machine learning models to predict customer needs.

(NYSE:CRM) stock and raised the price target to $245 from $230, noting that Salesforce margin and free cash flow story remains strong.  At the end of the first quarter of 2023, 136 hedge funds in the database of Insider Monkey held stakes worth $9 billion in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), compared to 117 in the preceding quarter worth $8 billion. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) has become a dominant global player in sales, customer service, commerce and marketing software over the past 20 years. The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.”7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 144Uber Technologies, Inc.

The upside can be linked primarily to strong demand across end markets and PH’s shareholder-friendly policies.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat’s Aiding the Stock?Steady demand across end markets and higher orders are supporting Parker-Hannifin’s growth. Orders were up 2% year over year in the fiscal third quarter. The Diversified Industrial segment is benefiting from continued broad-based growth in the North American region. The segment’s revenues increased 10.8% year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Revenues at the Aerospace Systems segment surged 67% year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 owing to robust original equipment manufacturer and maintenance, repair and operations commercial activity.Benefits from Parker-Hannifin’s Win Strategy, which focuses on innovation, strategic positioning, distribution growth and incentive plan changes to drive organic growth, is expected to have boosted the company’s shares. Thanks to contribution from the Win Strategy, the company’s adjusted EBITDA margin increased 80 basis points year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.The September 2022 acquisition of Meggitt plc is driving growth of the Aerospace Systems segment. Segmental revenues surged 88.9% year over year in the fiscal third quarter. The acquisition has expanded Parker-Hannifin’s presence in the United Kingdom, positioning it well to provide a broader suite of solutions for aircraft and aeroengine components and systems.Considering the benefits of this acquisition and strength across key end markets, Parker-Hannifin improved earnings and organic growth forecast for fiscal 2023. The company expects fiscal 2023 organic sales to increase approximately 10% compared with a rise of 6-8% anticipated earlier. Adjusted earnings are estimated to be between $20.60 and $20.90 per share compared with $19.20-$19.70 estimated earlier.Parker-Hannifin’s commitment to reward shareholders through dividends holds promise. In April, PH hiked its dividend by 11% to $1.48 per share (annually: $5.92). In the first nine months of fiscal 2023, Parker-Hannifin rewarded its shareholders with dividends of $513.23 million, up 29% year over year.Story continuesWill the Uptrend in Shares Last?While a slowdown in the manufacturing sector hints at a softer demand environment for Parker-Hannifin, market watchers predict an improvement in the situation in the second half of 2023. This signals industrial companies, including PH, to prepare for demand recovery in the future. Continued improvements in supply chains and faster deliveries are expected to aid PH’s performance in 2023.Despite a slowdown in manufacturing activities, key end markets have remained strong.

However, mounting expenses and stiff competition across the credit rating industry are headwinds.Looking at the financials, MCO's revenues witnessed a five-year (2018-2022) compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.3%. Though the metric declined in 2022 and the first quarter of 2023 because of weakness in bond issuance volumes, the top line is expected to rise given the improved mix and lower-risk nature of the company’s product portfolio.Moody's continues to pursue growth in areas outside the core credit ratings service. The company has increased its exposure to the banking and insurance industries and is diversifying into professional services and ERS businesses. These constant efforts have added stability to its top-line growth.Moreover, Moody's has grown inorganically and restructured its business from time to time to remain profitable by cross-selling opportunities across products and vertical markets. Last year, it announced a deal to acquire SCRiesgo and acquired 360kompany AG. These, along with other strategic buyouts over the years, are expected to continue helping the company diversify revenues and be accretive to earnings.Further, analysts are bullish about the stock’s earnings prospects. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for MCO's current-year earnings has been revised 4.1% upward over the last 60 days. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).In the past three months, shares of MCO have gained 11% against the industry's 1.3% decline. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research However, Moody's operating expenses have remained elevated over the past several years, with the metric recording a CAGR of 8.6% for the five-year period ended 2022, mainly due to a rise in selling, general and administrative costs. The uptrend in expenses continued in the first quarter of 2023. Overall costs are expected to remain elevated because of inflation and as the company continues to invest in franchises and grow inorganically. It expects 2023 operating expenses to increase in the mid-single-digit percent range.Story continuesThe company faces competition from Fitch, S&amp;P Ratings Services, Morningstar and many other regional providers. In the analytics segment, it faces competition from Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Bloomberg, IBM, Fiserv and many others. In the risk management software market, MCO competes with large software developers including SAS, Oracle, IBM and Mysis.

Summer months are typically when customers use more electricity, primarily for cooling their homes and businesses. Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&amp;E) is encouraging customers to consider no- and low-cost actions today to improve energy efficiency at home and at work to help reduce energy costs.Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PRNewsfoto/Pacific Gas and Electric Company)PG&amp;E offers resources all customers can use to help manage energy bills, as well as assistance programs for income-eligible customers.""The summer is historically a period when customers use more energy and experience higher energy bills, especially in warmer climate zones where air conditioner (AC) units provide relief from the extreme heat. We're here to help our customers prepare and raise awareness of ways we can all use energy more efficiently and reduce costs,"" said Vincent Davis, PG&amp;E's Vice President of Customer Operations and Enablement.Air Conditioner ChecklistThe air conditioner accounts for more than 40% of summer energy use.

Also, maintain blinds, drapes and curtains to help shade living spaces from the sun and keep the home cooler. Keeping blinds or drapes closed on sunny days can help to block the heat and save up to $30/year.Remove any dust from refrigerator coils or consider replacing an old fridge made prior to 2001 with a newer, energy-efficient model. Upgrading to an energy-efficient refrigerator could save up to $40/year.Make sure light fixtures are equipped with LED bulbs, which emit less heat, use less energy and could help save up to $260/year.Apply weatherstripping to doors, caulk around windows and doors, and install a door sweep on the garage door(s). Sealing these gaps can help to limit the flow of warm outside air into the home, keep the cool air inside, and help save up to $120/year.Story continuesOutdoor Pool Summer PrepLimit the amount of time the pool pump runs, and consider investing in a variable speed pool pump, which could help save up to $625/year.Use a pool cover to help keep your heated pool warm and reduce the amount of energy needed for heating.

In that report, analysts expect Marathon Oil to post earnings of $0.58 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 56.06%. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $1.65 billion, down 28.52% from the prior-year quarter.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $2.71 per share and revenue of $6.9 billion, which would represent changes of -39.51% and -14.14%, respectively, from the prior year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Marathon Oil.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So when we looked at Marathon Oil (NYSE:MRO) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Marathon Oil is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$3.2b ÷ (US$20b - US$2.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Marathon Oil has an ROCE of 18%.  In absolute terms, that's a pretty normal return, and it's somewhat close to the Oil and Gas industry average of 23%. See our latest analysis for Marathon Oil roceIn the above chart we have measured Marathon Oil's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Marathon Oil.What Does the ROCE Trend For Marathon Oil Tell Us?Marathon Oil has broken into the black (profitability) and we're sure it's a sight for sore eyes. While the business was unprofitable in the past, it's now turned things around and is earning 18% on its capital. Interestingly, the capital employed by the business has remained relatively flat, so these higher returns are either from prior investments paying off or increased efficiencies. With no noticeable increase in capital employed, it's worth knowing what the company plans on doing going forward in regards to reinvesting and growing the business. So if you're looking for high growth, you'll want to see a business's capital employed also increasing.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTo bring it all together, Marathon Oil has done well to increase the returns it's generating from its capital employed. Considering the stock has delivered 21% to its stockholders over the last five years, it may be fair to think that investors aren't fully aware of the promising trends yet. So exploring more about this stock could uncover a good opportunity, if the valuation and other metrics stack up.Since virtually every company faces some risks, it's worth knowing what they are, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for Marathon Oil   (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) that you should know about.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:MSI) Looks Interesting, And It's About To Pay A Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/motorola-solutions-inc-nyse-msi-101110119.html,1686305470,STORY,['MSI'],"[It looks like Motorola Solutions, Inc. (NYSE:MSI) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Accordingly, Motorola Solutions investors that purchase the stock on or after the 14th of June will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 14th of July.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.88 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$3.52 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Motorola Solutions has a trailing yield of approximately 1.3% on its current stock price of $279.21. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether Motorola Solutions has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut. Check out our latest analysis for Motorola Solutions Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Motorola Solutions paid out a comfortable 41% of its profit last year. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. Fortunately, it paid out only 39% of its free cash flow in the past year.It's positive to see that Motorola Solutions's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Story continuesClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Motorola Solutions's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 24% per annum for the past five years. Earnings per share have been growing very quickly, and the company is paying out a relatively low percentage of its profit and cash flow. This is a very favourable combination that can often lead to the dividend multiplying over the long term, if earnings grow and the company pays out a higher percentage of its earnings.Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, Motorola Solutions has lifted its dividend by approximately 13% a year on average. It's exciting to see that both earnings and dividends per share have grown rapidly over the past few years.Final TakeawayIs Motorola Solutions an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Motorola Solutions has been growing earnings at a rapid rate, and has a conservatively low payout ratio, implying that it is reinvesting heavily in its business; a sterling combination. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.So while Motorola Solutions looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Motorola Solutions you should know about.Generally, we wouldn't recommend just buying the first dividend stock you see.

61,10d22273-7982-31f7-a3ee-be926d090f57,MSI,2023-06-09,Motorola (MSI) Solutions Halve Misrouted 9-1-1 Calls in Utah,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/motorola-msi-solutions-halve-misrouted-163600098.html,1686242160,STORY,['MSI'],"[Motorola Solutions, Inc. MSI recently announced that it has reduced misrouted 9-1-1 calls for public safety answering points (PSAPs) by about 50% in Utah, enabling faster response time for people in distress. Leveraging the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) i3-compliant 9-1-1 Next Generation Core Services (NGCS) call routing technology, the company has significantly improved emergency response to help save countless lives.The NENA i3 standard defines how emergency IP-based 9-1-1 calls from originating service providers should be routed to determine the most appropriate PSAP to receive the call based on its location. It also determines how different NGCS networks must interconnect to allow NG 9-1-1 calls to be exchanged between the networks.Motorola is among the pioneers to offer 9-1-1 call routing technology based on NENA i3 standards. Its NGCS call routing technology uses the wireless caller’s location to deliver the 9-1-1 call to the correct PSAP for prompt deployment of emergency local resources. It is faster than legacy methods that route the call based on the location of the wireless carrier tower that the caller is connected to, which often directs the call to a PSAP outside the caller’s area. This often leads to a delayed response as precious time is wasted in call waiting and subsequent transfer to the correct PSAP.The interoperable, resilient next-generation 9-1-1 systems are being increasingly deployed across the nation for faster emergency support. For the record, Motorola’s next-generation 9-1-1 call routing is reportedly being deployed by several North American agencies serving more than 44.7 million people.As one of the top providers of mission-critical communication products and services, Motorola has ensured a steady revenue stream from this niche market. This communications equipment maker intends to augment its position in the public safety domain by entering into alliances with other players in the ecosystem. It is poised to benefit from organic growth and acquisition initiatives, disciplined capital deployment and a favorable global macroeconomic environment.Motorola expects to witness strong demand across land mobile radio products, services and software. These systems drive demand for additional device sales and promote software upgrades and infrastructure expansion. The comprehensive suite of services ensures continuity and reduces risks related to critical communications operations.The stock has gained 31.1% over the past year against the industry’s decline of 12.3%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMotorola currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

That means Activision will also be able to make their case to the tribunal.At a preliminary hearing in May, Microsoft's lawyers accused the CMA of being a global ""outlier"" for blocking the Activision takeover, which has been approved by regulators including the European Union's competition authority.The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has also blocked the deal, a decision which is under appeal by Microsoft.Microsoft's president Brad Smith, who met Britain's finance minister for talks on Tuesday, said earlier this week that the company wants to address regulators' concerns about the Activision acquisition.(Reporting by Sam Tobin; editing by William James)]"

Yardeni Research President Ed Yardeni joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the trends seen across the tech space and the potential to broaden out to other industries.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]SEANA SMITH: The era of mega cap stocks is here with market leadership dominated by just eight names. And as these stocks break away from the rest of the pack, we're certainly seeing a shift in market behavior. Here to join us now with more on that, whether or not that can continues, Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. Ed, it's good to see you again. You're out with a recent note, first line. And this is all the AI euphoria leading the stock market into another mother of all melt-ups. What do you think?ED YARDENI: Well, I think we've already had a significant melt-up in the MegaCap-8 since they bottomed in early January. We're up about 58% since that bottom. So that is quite a melt-up in these stocks. And these are big cap names that usually don't move like that. Usually, it's small cap names that have those kind of moves. But clearly, investors feeling very, very comfortable with those stocks in an environment where there's still a lot of pessimism, still a lot of bearishness.AKIKO FUJITA: At what point do we start to see those gains be broadened out a bit more?ED YARDENI: Well, I think the bears have been saying that, because this market is so narrowly focused on just a few stocks, that it's still a bear market. And that it's going to mean a sell-off. But I think the market could just as well broaden out. I think it may very well be broadening out.Let's not forget that the big run for some of these mega cap names really occurred with the banking crisis when people wanted to bail out of the banks. And they figured that if we're going to have a financial crisis, that can't be good for energy stocks. So they bailed out of energy stocks. But they still wanted to be in the market. And they figured out that the MegaCap-8 stocks have a lot of cash flow, don't need to go to the banks, and have a lot of technology upside.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: And there's discussion about whether or not this new market narrative, what we're seeing in terms of the leadership. If that's going to last, even if we do start to see broader participation, broadening out of the market leaders, I guess, how big-- how critical is the AI rallies, AI story to the continued success of so many of these larger tech names that have a heck of a lot of other things that are going into their businesses, and AI is only a very small part?ED YARDENI: It's right. And it's just starting. There's a certain amount of hype. Nobody really knows the extent to which this really is going to be a huge technology. But everybody seems to figure it out that the MegaCap-8 stocks are going to be at the forefront of this technology and other technologies that are out there. It's not as though AI is the only technology that we have out there. We've got robotics. We've got automation. We've got nanotechnology. There's a tremendous amount of technologies that can be integrated to increase the productivity of the brain.In the past, technology or innovations increased the productivity of brawn, of the ability to lift things, to move things. This, I mean, the ability to kind of remember everything that's known in history and recall it through AI is just an awesome development. But I think it's-- the market is just trying to figure out who else is going to benefit. The answer is everybody. I think you had a guest on before that basically said that.and the idea that I-- that I'm toying with is that we increasingly have to think about every company as a technology company, because, if you're not using technology to increase your productivity, your efficiency, and it's not just AI, but if you aren't doing that, you're going to be left behind.AKIKO FUJITA: You've been targeting 4,600 on the S&amp;P 500 by the end of the year. You know, that's still a lot of upside from where current levels are right now. How much of that is going to be driven by this tech rally we've been seeing? How much of it ultimately you think comes down to where the Fed moves?ED YARDENI: We have-- like the bears, I would feel more comfortable if the market broadened out. The bears are saying that it's not going to broaden out and instead we're going to have a sell off. I think it is going to broaden out. And I think we'd all feel better about the market if it broadens out. And I think one of the areas where it could broaden out would be in financials, the other energy, the ones that have been lagging behind here, the ones that have been viewed as potentially being vulnerable to a recessionary environment.I think as investors calm down about the recession scare, I realize that we've been in a recession. It's just been a rolling recession, affecting different industries at different times. And on balance, the economy continues to grow around 1% to 2%. And earnings probably bottomed in the second quarter right now. And I think the market is looking already past the here and now to 2024. And that looks pretty good.SEANA SMITH: So what does that mean then for the Fed? They're in a pretty tough spot just in terms of they're still in the fight against inflation much higher than where the 2% target where they would like it to be. Lots of questions just about how much of that work has already been done, and we need more time in order to see it work its way through the system. Are you expecting another hike? And how much of that is priced in?ED YARDENI: I'm not. I'm thinking that Fed officials actually did a good job of telling us what they were going to do, what they wanted to do, what they wanted to achieve. And what they wanted to do, as they've been saying for months now, is they wanted to get the federal funds rate up to a restrictive level, restrictive enough to slow the economy down and bring inflation down.I think 5%, 5 and a 1/4% on the Fed funds rate is proving to be restrictive enough. It seemed to have generated a mini-banking crisis, so we don't want to go there again and have it broadened out. So I think it would be a mistake for the Fed to raise rates. And, you know, they have said that they expect to be keeping the Fed funds rate at a restrictive level. Markets have been thinking they're going to bring it down. But I think they may very well achieve what they wanted-- keep it at 5%, 5 and 1/4% through the end of the year and then reassess things.But it all adds up, I think, to a continuation of economic growth. I think inflation is going to continue to moderate. And it's not just about tight monetary policy, it's also that the pandemic caused a lot of the inflation. And the shock and the aftershocks of the pandemic are wearing off.SEANA SMITH: Treasury now betting about a 70% chance that the Fed will keep rates steady at the meeting next week. Ed Yardeni, great to have you, president of Yardeni Research.ED YARDENI: Thank you.]"

Just don’t tell Apple that.The company went to great pains to distance itself from the broader AR/VR headset market and, more specifically, its now rival Meta (META). Not only did Apple price the Vision Pro well beyond Meta’s Quest line of devices, it didn’t even call the Vision Pro a headset. Instead, Apple refers to its latest product as a “spatial computer.”Apple’s messaging is clear. The company isn’t looking to associate itself with an industry that’s yet to take off, despite years of efforts from the likes of Meta, HTC, Magic Leap, and others. And don’t expect Apple to ever talk about the metaverse.Instead, the company is selling its own spin on the headset category. But despite its best efforts to initially market the Vision Pro as a product unto itself, the reality is, it’s as much a headset as any of its competitors’ offerings.Spatial computingApple’s push to separate itself from the AR/VR herd is to simply not to call the Vision Pro exactly what it is…a headset. Read through the company’s press release and you won’t find a single trace of the word headset. Rewatch the roughly 40-minute Vision Pro portion of Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference 2023 keynote, and you won’t hear anyone utter the term “headset.”Instead, Apple wants you to think of the Vision Pro as a “spatial computer.” Something that allows you to interact with augmented reality versions of the apps you already use on your iPhone, iPad, and Mac including Messages, Photos, and Safari.The Apple Vision Pro headset is displayed in a showroom on the Apple campus Monday, June 5, 2023, in Cupertino, Calif. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)Apple also goes out of its way to dance around the term “virtual reality.” Instead, the company refers to levels of immersion when using the Vision Pro. One example is the Environments app, which allows you to view virtual reality versions of places like Mount Hood in Oregon. Rather than saying you can move between augmented reality and virtual reality in the app, Apple talks up being able to control how immersed you are in the app.Story continuesMark Zuckerberg, meanwhile, specifically shouted out the Meta Quest 3’s virtual reality capabilities and referred to it as a headset in an Instagram post announcing the product just days before Apple’s WWDC.It’s not just balking at calling the Vision Pro a headset or that it offers virtual reality capabilities, either.No metaverse for AppleUnlike Meta, Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT), Apple has never talked about jumping into the metaverse. And if you thought the company’s Vision Pro was going to kickstart that effort, you were sorely mistaken.Apple avoided mentioning any ideas remotely similar to Meta’s concept of the metaverse, which is a series of interconnected worlds that allow you to interact with other people wearing headsets. In fact, it tried to make the case that its offering is more about maintaining connections with the people around you.That’s the purpose of the Vision Pro’s EyeSight feature. The capability will allow other people in the room with you to see a digital projection of your eyes on the Vision Pro’s external display when you’re wearing it.A Meta employee demonstrates the Meta Quest Pro VR Headset. (Photo by ROBYN BECK/AFP via Getty Images) (ROBYN BECK via Getty Images)How exactly that will work, and whether it will actually make wearing a headset feel less isolating remains to be seen, since I wasn’t able to try the feature during my Vision Pro demo. But it’s clear Apple is more interested in connecting people in the real world rather than connecting via the metaverse. Or at least trying to.Zuckerberg already has his knives out for Apple's headset and its price. According to The New York Times, the Meta CEO criticized the Vision Pro during a town hall meeting with employees.""I was really curious to see what they’d ship, and it’s a good sign for our own development that they don’t have any magical solutions to the laws of physics that we haven’t already explored,"" he said.""Our vision of the metaverse and presence is fundamentally social and about people interacting and feeling closer in new amazing ways. By contrast, every demo Apple showed was someone sitting on a couch by themselves.""Not exactly priced to moveIf avoiding using the same terms and trends as its competitors isn’t enough to convince you Apple is trying to separate itself from the pack of AR/VR headset makers out there, then consider the Vision Pro’s price.At $3,499, the Vision Pro is far more expensive than Meta’s Quest Pro, $999, and Quest 3, $499; and easily eclipses Sony’s (SONY) $549 PlayStation VR2 and HTC’s $1,249 Vive Pro 2. In fact, Apple’s pricing scheme is only matched by Microsoft’s Hololens 2, which costs $3,500.Apple is positioning its headset as a premium device that’s less a high-priced toy and more an ultra-premium device that will lead the company into a new era.The question now is whether trying to differentiate itself from the pack will prove successful for Apple’s Vision Pro sales in the long term. We’ll learn more when the Vision Pro launches sometime early next year.Daniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

On the same day GameStop Corporation (NYSE: GME) reported its revenue contracted and its loss narrowed YoY in its fiscal first quarter, shares have plummeted more than 20% in extended trading after the gaming company revealed in a filing it fired CEO Matthew Furlong without providing a reason for his termination. Ryan Cohen has been appointed as the new executive chairman.The Remake Of The Gaming GameEven the gaming scenery is evolving. As sales of video games continue falling from month to month, there’s the promise of cloud gaming, one that remains unfulfilled after already a decade of development. GameStop has intense competitors in this game, no other than titans themselves, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE: SONY). Sony was among the first players to enter the field, and its CEO Kenichiro Yoshida admits of still being technically difficult. This is also a difficult challenge for even Microsoft who rattled the gaming industry with its intention to purchase Activision. Although Microsoft got blocked from UK regulators, the regulatory response has been mixed as EU regulators cleared the purchase on the basis of Microsoft alleviating the concerns. All in all, Microsoft still has a shot at cementing its dominance on this front, as the deal would make the tech titan the third biggest in gaming by revenue, behind Tencent and Sony. Despite the difficulties and Microsoft’s bet, Sony is not giving up on its attempt to remake the gaming industry.GameStop’s First Quarter HighlightsFor the quarter that ended on April 29th, GameStop generated revenue of $1.24 billion, which is a drop compared to last year’s comparable quarter when revenue amounted to $1.38 billion. The resulting net loss amounted to $50.5 million or 17 cents per share, which is an improvement from last year’s Q1 when it amounted to $157.9 million, or 52 cents a share, showing that management is doing a good job at lowering costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were lowered from $452.2 million in the year-ago quarter to $345.7 million for the quarter. Transactions costs from restructuring efforts amounted to $14.5 million and GameStop warned of further transaction charges in the undergoing quarter.Story continuesAlthough European sales expanded 26.2% YoY, revenue in the U.S. Canada and Australia tanked 16.4%, 18.5% and 8.9%, respectively. The drop was contributed to currency fluctuations, fewer significant gaming title launches and soft sales in pre-owned software and hardware and collectibles where the company has the potential for long-term growth. The collectibles unit contracted from last year’s Q1 when revenue amounted to $220.9 million to $173 million it generated during this year's first quarter.Firing Of The CEOThe decision to part ways with Furlong comes only months after GameStop reported its first quarterly profit in two years which is when Furlong got behind the wheel to execute the company’s turnaround. The ex Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) executive was supposed to equip the gaming retailer to compete with Microsoft, Sony and even Walmart Inc (NYSE: WMT). On the same day the decision was announced, Furlong also resigned from the company’s board which now has five members. Without a comment, the filing simply stated the company is making efforts to both stabilize and optimize its core business, as well as achieve sustained profitability through efficient capital allocation, and therefore believes Mr. Cohen’s leadership will further unlock value over the long-haul. Cohen’s investment firm, RC Ventures, currently owns a 11.9% stake in GameStop.All in all, if sales of video games continue to fall, management needs to continue lowering costs so GameStop can remain in the game. But if GameStop wants to play for keeps, it will need to show more of that long-term value creation.DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

71,8ef02f89-702c-3fee-8a91-3e0ffd4ec4aa,SIG,2023-06-09,There’s now proof of the loneliness epidemic and how COVID devastated dating—a drop in Signet engagement ring sales,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-proof-loneliness-epidemic-covid-215858383.html,1686261538,STORY,['SIG'],"[It’s been 21 months since the COVID vaccine debuted, and love still isn’t in the air. Signet Jewelers stock slid 10.6% on Thursday after the company reported a 9.3% year-over-year decline in sales, and CEO Gina Drosos says lingering loneliness owing to the pandemic is partly to blame.Drosos attributed the company’s disappointing quarter to two factors. The first are economic pressures on consumers such as regional bank failures, lower tax refunds, and a “continued narrative from the Fed” of reining in inflation by pushing unemployment higher through interest rate hikes. But the second factor isn’t economic—it’s that Americans are still struggling to find love despite the federal government declaring the national pandemic emergency over.“We’re seeing a temporary lull in engagements,” Drosos said on CNBC. “People weren’t dating, they weren’t able to with the COVID lockdowns about three years ago, and so that’s a lull that we expect to continue, but really start to rebound toward the end of the calendar year.”Signet’s revenue declined during the pandemic, but began to rise again in 2021. However, the rebound has recently cooled, causing revenue to fall 9.2% since this quarter last year.In another sign of trouble, the company on Thursday slashed its 2024 sales forecast from $7.67 billion to $7.84 billion to $7.1 billion to $7.3 billion, citing the COVID dating dry spell and increasingly frugal consumers.After the string of disappointing news, Signet’s shares fell nearly 12% on Wednesday, the most since September, followed by more losses today.Signet, which owns Zales and Kay Jewelers, is not the only bridal retailer experiencing difficulty. In April, David’s Bridal, the largest bridal firm in the U.S., filed for bankruptcy.Loneliness and isolation, lately reaching epidemic levels, are linked to premature death, a May report from the surgeon general found. The 82-page study revealed that young people in particular are more isolated than ever—socially interacting 70% less than two decades ago. The report also warned of the physical consequences of loneliness, including increased risk of dementia, stroke, and infectious disease.Story continues“It’s hard to put a price tag, if you will, on the amount of human suffering that people are experiencing right now,” Dr. Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, said last month on NPR.After quarantine, masking, and remote work and learning, many people felt like they had to relearn how to navigate social life. Logan Ury, director of relationship science at dating app Hinge, applied this phenomenon to dating with the term FODA: fear of dating again.“We’re creatures of habit, so when we had to isolate for so long, and we were told to be wary of other people who are not in our bubble, that sticks with us and has a lasting impact,” psychologist Justin Puder told Fortune. “So when you’re going out and dating people you don’t know, I can understand people having some apprehension.”Puder added that COVID lockdowns caused many people to transition to online modes of connection and dating, and that while dating apps make it easier to “match” with people than ever, it can make dating harder when the relationship has to migrate to in-person interaction.The pandemic exacerbated an existing 50-year trend in marriage decline. Since the 1970s, the marriage rate has dropped nearly 60% as younger generations forgo tying the traditional knot. Puder said that this may be caused by financial pressures, as younger generations are finding it harder to make ends meet. Engagement rings are expensive, and even couples ready to marry may not be ready to spend thousands on a piece of jewelry. Puder, who is a millennial, said that many people of his generation struggle just to afford housing, so marriage is often unaffordable, too.“Financing for the ring, financing to buy property, many things that don’t have to but might go along with marriage, are hard to acquire,” Puder said. “All these stressors weigh on you when you’re trying to make the choice of ‘Am I at a place right now to be married?’”While it’s uncertain which combination of factors has perpetuated the loneliness epidemic and dating difficulty, the surgeon general’s report recommended limiting “disproportionate time in front of screens instead of people.” Puder echoed this suggestion, saying that people should increase their in-person interactions as much as possible by spending time with friends or joining interest-based communities.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

It is a vital component of the agricultural sector and has a substantial impact on the nation's overall economy. The beef industry encompasses various activities, including cattle farming, meat processing, distribution, and retail. The United States is known for its high-quality beef production, and the industry has evolved over the years to meet domestic and international demand. The United States is one of the world's largest producers of beef, with a well-established cattle industry.  Cattle production involves raising and breeding cattle primarily for beef production. Different breeds of cattle are raised in various regions, with notable ones including Angus, Hereford, and Holstein.Beef is a staple in the American diet, and domestic consumption remains high. Additionally, the United States exports a significant amount of beef to countries around the world. Export markets are crucial for the industry's growth, and the United States is one of the largest beef exporters globally. The beef industry contributes significantly to the US economy, providing employment opportunities and generating revenue. It supports various sectors, including agriculture, transportation, retail, and food service. The industry's economic impact extends beyond cattle farming to industries such as feed production, veterinary services, equipment manufacturing, and more.The beef industry creates employment opportunities, particularly in rural areas where cattle farming and meat processing facilities are located. It supports a range of jobs, from farmers and ranchers to meatpackers, butchers, truck drivers, and retail staff. Beef is a vital source of protein and nutrients in the American diet, contributing to food security and nutrition. The industry plays a crucial role in meeting the protein needs of the population and providing a diverse range of beef products. The export of beef products contributes to the country's trade balance and promotes economic growth. By tapping into international markets, the US beef industry strengthens its competitiveness and expands its customer base.Story continuesInvestors eager to own a piece of the food industry should consider stocks like Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX), McDonald’s Corporation (NYSE:MCD), and Yum!

The segment’s revenues increased 10.8% year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2023. Revenues at the Aerospace Systems segment surged 67% year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2023 owing to robust original equipment manufacturer and maintenance, repair and operations commercial activity.Benefits from Parker-Hannifin’s Win Strategy, which focuses on innovation, strategic positioning, distribution growth and incentive plan changes to drive organic growth, is expected to have boosted the company’s shares. Thanks to contribution from the Win Strategy, the company’s adjusted EBITDA margin increased 80 basis points year over year in the first nine months of fiscal 2023.The September 2022 acquisition of Meggitt plc is driving growth of the Aerospace Systems segment. Segmental revenues surged 88.9% year over year in the fiscal third quarter.

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like Sysco (NYSE:SYY), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. See our latest analysis for Sysco How Quickly Is Sysco Increasing Earnings Per Share?The market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Over the last three years, Sysco has grown EPS by 5.8% per year. That might not be particularly high growth, but it does show that per-share earnings are moving steadily in the right direction.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While we note Sysco achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 15% to US$76b. That's encouraging news for the company!The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. For finer detail, click on the image.earnings-and-revenue-historyWhile we live in the present moment, there's little doubt that the future matters most in the investment decision process. So why not check this interactive chart depicting future EPS estimates, for Sysco?Story continuesAre Sysco Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Sysco, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Given insiders own a significant chunk of shares, currently valued at US$63m, they have plenty of motivation to push the business to succeed. That's certainly enough to let shareholders know that management will be very focussed on long term growth.Is Sysco Worth Keeping An Eye On?One positive for Sysco is that it is growing EPS. That's nice to see. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. These two factors are a huge highlight for the company which should be a strong contender your watchlists. We don't want to rain on the parade too much, but we did also find 2 warning signs for Sysco that you need to be mindful of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So when we looked at Archer-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) and its trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Archer-Daniels-Midland, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.12 = US$4.4b ÷ (US$59b - US$23b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Archer-Daniels-Midland has an ROCE of 12%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Food industry average of 9.7% it's much better. Check out our latest analysis for Archer-Daniels-Midland roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Archer-Daniels-Midland compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Archer-Daniels-Midland here  for free.What Does the ROCE Trend For Archer-Daniels-Midland Tell Us?The trends we've noticed at Archer-Daniels-Midland are quite reassuring. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 12%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 30%. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at Archer-Daniels-Midland thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn summary, it's great to see that Archer-Daniels-Midland can compound returns by consistently reinvesting capital at increasing rates of return, because these are some of the key ingredients of those highly sought after multi-baggers. And with a respectable 86% awarded to those who held the stock over the last five years, you could argue that these developments are starting to get the attention they deserve. With that being said, we still think the promising fundamentals mean the company deserves some further due diligence.Like most companies, Archer-Daniels-Midland does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign  that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

Since 2008, PMI has invested more than USD 10.5 billion to develop, scientifically substantiate and commercialize innovative smoke-free products for adults who would otherwise continue to smoke, with the goal of completely ending the sale of cigarettes. This includes the building of world-class scientific assessment capabilities, notably in the areas of pre-clinical systems toxicology, clinical and behavioral research, as well as post-market studies.

Excluding the negative currency impact, sales rose 13%. The upside was driven by strategic pricing actions undertaken by management during the quarter, sales from the newly-acquired HRA Pharma and the acquisition of the U.S. &amp; Canadian GoodStart infant formula brand. These were partially offset by unfavorable currency movements and divested Latin American businesses. Organic net sales (excluding the effects of acquisitions and divestitures and the impact of currency) were up 6.4% year over year.Segment DiscussionCSCA: The segment’s net sales in the first quarter of 2023 came in at $763.7 million, up 7.6% year over year, driven by acquisitions and strategic price increases. However, the upside was partially offset by two voluntary recalls during the quarter — one for a major national brand infant formula and another for an OTC product.CSCI: The segment reported net sales of $418.1 million, up 14.7% from the year-ago period’s levels. At constant-currency (cc) rates, sales were up 23.6% year over year. Organically sales increased 4.0%. Segment revenues benefited from the higher sales of HRA Pharma brands and strategic pricing actions.

RMD is gaining investors’ confidence, backed by the prospect of the company’s digital health solutions. During the fiscal third quarter earnings update, the company provided impressive updates on its top three strategic priorities. Within the respiratory care business, the adoption of bilevel and other non-invasive ventilator solutions continue to drive growth. Yet, escalated expenses and reimbursement headwinds are concerning for the company.In the past year, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has increased 3.7% against the 28.5% decline of the industry and a 8.8% rise of the S&amp;P 500 composite.The renowned medical device company has a market capitalization of $32.62 billion. RMD has an earnings yield of 2.92% against the industry’s yield of -2.29%. The company’s earnings surpassed estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and matched the same in one quarter, delivering an average surprise of 2.86%.Let’s delve deeper.UpsidesPotential in Digital Health:  Amid the pandemic, ResMed saw increased demand for its digital health solutions globally with the robust adoption of remote patient engagement and population health management. During its earnings call for the fiscal third quarter, ResMed noted that it has over 14.5 billion medical data in the cloud and over 20.5 million cloud-connectable medical devices on bedside tables in 140 countries worldwide.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchDuring the last 12 months, the company improved over 156 million lives with its device platforms, full mask systems and software solutions in digital health. Meanwhile, the launch and market reaction toward the AirSense 11 device platform has been favorable. ResMed continued to work through some supply chain constraints and expects to steadily improve the global availability of AirSense 11 over the next several quarters.Progress in Three-Horizon Growth Strategy: ResMed had identified three horizons for future growth — to grow and differentiate core sleep apnea, COPD and asthma businesses; to deliver advanced medical devices as well as globally scalable digital health solutions; and to innovate advanced software solutions for care delivered digitally.Story continuesWe are impressed to see the strong adoption of the myAir patient app. The company noted that AirSense 11 adoption rates of myAir are more than double the adoption rate of myAir on the AirSense 10 platform. Increasing production and global availability of the AirSense 11 platform remains a top priority for ResMed.The company is continuously transforming out-of-hospital health care at scale, leading the market in digital health technology across the business. Meanwhile, the strong and sustainable growth of the core SaaS business is encouraging. The reported quarter witnessed high single digit growth in SaaS organic revenues across its portfolio.COVID-19-Led Critical Care Drives Demand for Products: ResMed continued to drive growth, banking on the strong adoption of bilevel and other non-invasive ventilator solutions globally. The company invested in newer-to-market technologies for patients with neuromuscular disease, COPD and asthma and beyond. During the fiscal third quarter, ResMed announced a pilot collaboration between its digital therapeutics team under the Propellor health brand and the University of California Davis Health System.The partnership allows eligible UC Davis Health patients to access Propellor’s digital therapeutics platform, including sensors for inhaled medications, a mobile app, a web portal, as well as on-going patient support.DownsidesMounting Expenses: The decline in the fiscal third quarter’s adjusted gross margin is attributed to an unfavorable product mix and higher component costs. Both selling, general and administrative expenses and research and development expenses rose in the quarter, resulting in a contraction in the adjusted operating margin.Reimbursement Headwind: ResMed's ability to sell its products largely depends on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for its products will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. These third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and can, deny coverage for treatments that may include the use of its productsEstimate TrendResMed has been witnessing a positive estimate revision trend for 2023. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has moved from $6.46 to $6.48 in the past 30 days.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $4.20 billion, up 17.3% from the year-ago reported figure.Key PicksSome better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Zimmer Biomet ZBH, Penumbra PEN and Hologic, Inc.

NARI recently announced the commercial launch of two new purpose-built products, the RevCore thrombectomy catheter and the Triever16 Curve catheter. RevCore is currently the first mechanical thrombectomy device designed to address venous in-stent thrombosis, whereas the Triever16 Curve catheter is the latest addition to Inari Medical’s FlowTriever platform.The latest launches are expected to significantly solidify Inari Medical’s foothold in the Venous Stent Thrombosis and Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) treatment space globally.Significance of the LaunchPer Inari Medical’s estimates, approximately half a million venous stents have been placed in the United States in the past few years. However, the company also confirmed that venous in-stent thrombosis is an increasingly common occurrence, affecting more patients every year. Inari Medical believes that RevCore will likely be able to address this issue as this is a solution for an entirely new patient pool, which is not currently addressed by the ClotTriever or FlowTriever platforms.Per Inari Medical, the Triever16 Curve catheter, which features a pre-shaped curve for targeted aspiration, is purpose-built to be versatile for both pulmonary embolism and peripheral thrombectomy. Triever16 Curve offers unique advantages over 16F continuous aspiration catheters, including compatibility with the FlowSaver blood return system and simple access to larger, more powerful 20F or 24F catheters within the company’s price-per-procedure model.An expert familiar with RevCore believes that it is an innovative tool as it physically removes in-stent thrombus and restores flow. It could also potentially reduce the need for additional reintervention. Another medical personnel commented that with the availability of the Triever16 Curve catheter, a wider VTE patient population will likely be served.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Future Market Insights, the global VTE treatment market was estimated to be $1.53 billion and is anticipated to reach $1.91 billion in 2029 at a CAGR of 3.7%. Factors like the increasing pervasiveness of cardiovascular diseases and cancer due to the adoption of smoking and increasing obesity rate, the rising elderly population and technological advancements are likely to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the commercial launches are likely to provide a significant boost to Inari Medical’s business globally.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, Inari Medical announced planned enrollment of the PEERLESS II trial, its third randomized controlled trial (RCT) in VTE. PEERLESS II is a prospective, global, multi-center RCT comparing the outcomes of intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) patients treated with the FlowTriever system versus anticoagulation alone.The same month, Inari Medical announced its first-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered a solid uptick in its year-over-year revenues. Management also confirmed the receipt of FDA clearances for several new products that are expected to drive market expansion while safeguarding the company from both existing and future competition.In March, Inari Medical announced positive results from the FLAME study in high-risk/massive PE. FLAME is the largest prospective study of interventional treatment in high-risk PE, a patient population with a historical mortality rate of 25-50%.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 6.7% in the past year against the industry’s 4.3% rise and the S&amp;P 500's 6.4% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Inari Medical carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

Yardeni Research President Ed Yardeni joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the trends seen across the tech space and the potential to broaden out to other industries.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]SEANA SMITH: The era of mega cap stocks is here with market leadership dominated by just eight names. And as these stocks break away from the rest of the pack, we're certainly seeing a shift in market behavior. Here to join us now with more on that, whether or not that can continues, Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. Ed, it's good to see you again. You're out with a recent note, first line. And this is all the AI euphoria leading the stock market into another mother of all melt-ups. What do you think?ED YARDENI: Well, I think we've already had a significant melt-up in the MegaCap-8 since they bottomed in early January. We're up about 58% since that bottom. So that is quite a melt-up in these stocks. And these are big cap names that usually don't move like that. Usually, it's small cap names that have those kind of moves. But clearly, investors feeling very, very comfortable with those stocks in an environment where there's still a lot of pessimism, still a lot of bearishness.AKIKO FUJITA: At what point do we start to see those gains be broadened out a bit more?ED YARDENI: Well, I think the bears have been saying that, because this market is so narrowly focused on just a few stocks, that it's still a bear market. And that it's going to mean a sell-off. But I think the market could just as well broaden out. I think it may very well be broadening out.Let's not forget that the big run for some of these mega cap names really occurred with the banking crisis when people wanted to bail out of the banks. And they figured that if we're going to have a financial crisis, that can't be good for energy stocks. So they bailed out of energy stocks. But they still wanted to be in the market. And they figured out that the MegaCap-8 stocks have a lot of cash flow, don't need to go to the banks, and have a lot of technology upside.Story continuesSEANA SMITH: And there's discussion about whether or not this new market narrative, what we're seeing in terms of the leadership. If that's going to last, even if we do start to see broader participation, broadening out of the market leaders, I guess, how big-- how critical is the AI rallies, AI story to the continued success of so many of these larger tech names that have a heck of a lot of other things that are going into their businesses, and AI is only a very small part?ED YARDENI: It's right. And it's just starting. There's a certain amount of hype. Nobody really knows the extent to which this really is going to be a huge technology. But everybody seems to figure it out that the MegaCap-8 stocks are going to be at the forefront of this technology and other technologies that are out there. It's not as though AI is the only technology that we have out there. We've got robotics. We've got automation. We've got nanotechnology. There's a tremendous amount of technologies that can be integrated to increase the productivity of the brain.In the past, technology or innovations increased the productivity of brawn, of the ability to lift things, to move things. This, I mean, the ability to kind of remember everything that's known in history and recall it through AI is just an awesome development. But I think it's-- the market is just trying to figure out who else is going to benefit. The answer is everybody. I think you had a guest on before that basically said that.and the idea that I-- that I'm toying with is that we increasingly have to think about every company as a technology company, because, if you're not using technology to increase your productivity, your efficiency, and it's not just AI, but if you aren't doing that, you're going to be left behind.AKIKO FUJITA: You've been targeting 4,600 on the S&amp;P 500 by the end of the year. You know, that's still a lot of upside from where current levels are right now. How much of that is going to be driven by this tech rally we've been seeing? How much of it ultimately you think comes down to where the Fed moves?ED YARDENI: We have-- like the bears, I would feel more comfortable if the market broadened out. The bears are saying that it's not going to broaden out and instead we're going to have a sell off. I think it is going to broaden out. And I think we'd all feel better about the market if it broadens out. And I think one of the areas where it could broaden out would be in financials, the other energy, the ones that have been lagging behind here, the ones that have been viewed as potentially being vulnerable to a recessionary environment.I think as investors calm down about the recession scare, I realize that we've been in a recession. It's just been a rolling recession, affecting different industries at different times. And on balance, the economy continues to grow around 1% to 2%. And earnings probably bottomed in the second quarter right now. And I think the market is looking already past the here and now to 2024. And that looks pretty good.SEANA SMITH: So what does that mean then for the Fed? They're in a pretty tough spot just in terms of they're still in the fight against inflation much higher than where the 2% target where they would like it to be. Lots of questions just about how much of that work has already been done, and we need more time in order to see it work its way through the system. Are you expecting another hike? And how much of that is priced in?ED YARDENI: I'm not. I'm thinking that Fed officials actually did a good job of telling us what they were going to do, what they wanted to do, what they wanted to achieve. And what they wanted to do, as they've been saying for months now, is they wanted to get the federal funds rate up to a restrictive level, restrictive enough to slow the economy down and bring inflation down.I think 5%, 5 and a 1/4% on the Fed funds rate is proving to be restrictive enough. It seemed to have generated a mini-banking crisis, so we don't want to go there again and have it broadened out. So I think it would be a mistake for the Fed to raise rates. And, you know, they have said that they expect to be keeping the Fed funds rate at a restrictive level. Markets have been thinking they're going to bring it down. But I think they may very well achieve what they wanted-- keep it at 5%, 5 and 1/4% through the end of the year and then reassess things.But it all adds up, I think, to a continuation of economic growth. I think inflation is going to continue to moderate. And it's not just about tight monetary policy, it's also that the pandemic caused a lot of the inflation. And the shock and the aftershocks of the pandemic are wearing off.SEANA SMITH: Treasury now betting about a 70% chance that the Fed will keep rates steady at the meeting next week. Ed Yardeni, great to have you, president of Yardeni Research.ED YARDENI: Thank you.]"

The company might give Prime subscribers the option to pay more for an ad-free alternative if it introduces ads in Prime Video.Per the reports, advertisers are eagerly waiting for Amazon to execute this plan and have shown more interest in premium movies and popular content having a huge viewer base.Also, the company has approached Warner Bros. Discovery and Paramount Global to introduce the ad-based tiers of the latter two on Prime Video Channels.Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and ConsensusAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote Amazon to BenefitThe latest Amazon plan is expected to drive its top-line growth primarily through execution.Moreover, it will aid the company in countering the impacts of rising inflationary pressure that has led to a slowdown in customers’ discretionary expenses, which, in turn, has hurt the rate of new sign-ups in the streaming industry.The extra charges customers would pay for the ad-free alternative of Prime Video will likely contribute well.Further, the ad revenues that it will generate from Prime Video will drive the company’s overall ad revenues, thus strengthening its ad business, which has been acting as a key catalyst.In first-quarter 2023, Amazon generated $9.51 billion in sales from advertising services, which increased 21% year over year.Growing ad revenues will then accelerate Amazon’s overall revenue generation as well as the financial performance of the company. This, in turn, will instill investor optimism in the stock.For 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net sales is pegged at $560.37 billion, reflecting growth of 9% from 2022.Amazon has gained 44% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the industry’s growth of 29.8%.Story continuesRising BattleAmazon’s strong contenders in the streaming market — Netflix NFLX and Disney DIS — have already introduced their respective ad-based tiers.Late last year, Netflix launched its ad-supported plan, namely Basic with Ads, in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Australia, Japan, Korea and Brazil.Notably, Basic with Ads is $13 less than Netflix’s Premium plan, nearly $9 less than the Standard plan and $3 less than the Basic plan.Meanwhile, Disney unveiled the ad-supported Disney+ plan in December 2022 in the United States, with more than 100 advertisers. The ad-supported plan includes Disney+’s exclusive originals and library content.The plan also supports up to seven profiles per account and streaming on up to four supported devices simultaneously.In addition, other major streaming services that offer ad-supported options include Hulu, HBO Max, Paramount+ and Peacock.Zacks Rank &amp; A Stock to ConsiderCurrently, Amazon carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

The series will follow the former Jedi Knight Ahsoka Tano as she investigates an emerging threat to a vulnerable galaxy, after the fall of the Empire.Disney+ has been a game-changer for Disney, thanks to its strong content portfolio. The service offers nearly 700 movies and 11,700 episodes of television shows from brands such as Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars and National Geographic and Disney+ originals.Disney+, as of Apr 1, 2023, had 157.8 million paid subscribers compared with 161.8 million as of Dec 31, 2022. Disney+ core subscribers grew modestly, with more than 600,000 net additions. Core international subscribers increased by close to $1 million.Domestic core subscribers declined slightly due to price increases. However, domestic average revenues per user increased 20% sequentially, reflecting strong subscription revenue growth.  The company also plans to increase the price of its ad-free tier by the end of this year.Following the footsteps of Netflix NFLX, Disney started offering an ad-supported tier on Dec 8, 2022. It has added more than 1,000 advertisers over the past year and now has 5,000 advertisers across its streaming platforms. Disney now plans to launch an ad tier on Disney+ in Europe by the end of 2023. The Walt Disney Company Price and ConsensusThe Walt Disney Company price-consensus-chart | The Walt Disney Company QuoteWhat to Expect From Disney in the Rest of 2023Disney shares have outperformed the Zacks Media Conglomerates industry on a year-to-date basis. However, it has underperformed its closest peer, Netflix. While Disney shares have gained 6.5%, the industry has returned 9.2% and Netflix shares have surged 35.6% over the same timeframe.A strong lineup of movies, including The Little Mermaid, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, The Boogeyman, Elemental and Haunted Mansion, bodes well for the Media and Entertainment Distribution segment.Revival in Parks, Experiences and Products businesses is encouraging. Theme Park business is likely to gain from strong demand across both domestic and international parks.Disney still expects fiscal 2023 revenues and operating income to grow in the high single-digit percentage range.

This move can be attributable to notable volume with a higher number of shares being traded than in a typical session. This compares to the stock's 13.6% gain over the past four weeks.Roku is benefitng from increased user engagement on The Roku Channel and continued popularity of the Roku TV program. The recent upswing can also be attributed to news that Amazon is planning to add ad-tier in its Prime service.This video streaming company is expected to post quarterly loss of $1.28 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -56.1%. Revenues are expected to be $769.61 million, up 0.7% from the year-ago quarter.Earnings and revenue growth expectations certainly give a good sense of the potential strength in a stock, but empirical research shows that trends in earnings estimate revisions are strongly correlated with near-term stock price movements.For Roku, the consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. And a positive trend in earnings estimate revision usually translates into price appreciation.

(NFLX): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-netflix-inc-130013593.html,1686229213,STORY,['NFLX'],"[Netflix (NFLX) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this internet video service have returned +19.2%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, which Netflix falls in, has gained 15.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Netflix is expected to post earnings of $2.79 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.6%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.14 points to a change of +12% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.4%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $14.52 indicates a change of +30.3% from what Netflix is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.3%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Netflix.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Netflix, the consensus sales estimate of $8.24 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +3.4%. The $33.77 billion and $37.87 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +6.8% and +12.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryNetflix reported revenues of $8.16 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +3.7%. EPS of $2.88 for the same period compares with $3.53 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.18 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.25%. The EPS surprise was +1.77%.Over the last four quarters, Netflix surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Netflix is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Netflix. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NYSE:TJX) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for TJX Companies The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At TJX CompaniesIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Chairman, Carol Meyrowitz, sold US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$67.62 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$77.76. When an insider sells below the current price, it suggests that they considered that lower price to be fair. That makes us wonder what they think of the (higher) recent valuation. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 21% of Carol Meyrowitz's holding.TJX Companies insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

Specifically, Senior Executive Vice President of Finance Scott Goldenberg ditched US$2.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of TJX CompaniesLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. TJX Companies insiders own about US$91m worth of shares. That equates to 0.1% of the company. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About TJX Companies Insiders?An insider hasn't bought TJX Companies stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since TJX Companies is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

119,94ecec33-b909-300e-95ec-25977be11a0a,TJX,2023-06-09,Here's Why Abercrombie (ANF) is Marching Ahead of the Industry,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-abercrombie-anf-marching-134200046.html,1686231720,STORY,"['ANF', 'TJX']","[Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co. ANF has been gaining from the continued momentum in the Abercrombie brand and sequential improvement in the Hollister brand. The apparel retailer undertook efforts to improve its inventory across all labels, thereby attracting customers to shop for a diverse range of products like dresses and cargo. Also, strategic investments across stores, digital and technology via its Always Forward Plan bodes well.This led to impressive first-quarter fiscal 2023 results, wherein the bottom and top lines surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Adjusted earnings of 39 cents per share in the first quarter increased 44.4% from the year-ago period’s 27 cents. Net sales of $836 million rose 3% year over year. Net sales grew 4% on a constant-currency basis.Its gross margin expanded 570 bps to 61% driven by 760 basis points from lower freight costs and 230 basis points from robust AUR growth, partly offset by 320 basis points from higher cotton and raw material costs, and 100 basis points from the adverse currency. Also, the adjusted operating income was $38.4 million against a loss of $6 million in the year-ago period.The company is working toward rationalizing its store base by reducing dependence on underperforming tourist driven locations. As part of its store optimization plans, Abercrombie plans to reposition larger format flagship locations to smaller omni-channel enabled stores. Progressing on these efforts, the company opened six stores, including three Hollister and Abercrombie stores each in the fiscal first quarter. It closed seven Hollister and three Abercrombie stores.ANF remains on track with its 2025 Always Forward plan focuses on brand growth, leveraging its omnichannel capabilities, and expanding digital penetration and financial discipline. As part of this plan, the company earlier provided a financial outlook for fiscal 2025 and a long-term view. It anticipates annual revenues of $4.1-$4.3 billion and an annual operating margin rate of 8% or more by the end of fiscal 2025. For the long term, management expects annual revenues of $5 billion and an annual operating margin rate of 10% or more.The company also predicts the Abercrombie &amp; Fitch and abercrombie kids brands to deliver a 6-8% sales CAGR over the next three years, with Hollister and Gilly Hicks brands likely to generate a flat-to-2% and 15% sales CAGR. Notably, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch adults are forecast to be the major driver.Also, Abercrombie intends to accelerate its digital revolution via Knowing Their Customer Better and Wowing Them Everywhere initiatives. Increased investment in customer analytics to meet and outpace customer demand bodes well. Lastly, it plans to generate at least $600 million of free cash flow in the next three years to deliver healthy shareholder returns, and drive omnichannel growth across digital and physical stores.Driven by these factors, management envisions fiscal 2023 net sales to grow 2-4% year over year, up from the prior guidance of 1-3% growth. It expects the Abercrombie brand to outperform Hollister. Region-wise, the United States is likely to outperform International. Also, fiscal 2023 includes a 53rd week, which is estimated to benefit sales by $45 million. Abercrombie expects an operating margin of 5-6%, up from the earlier stated 4-5%. This includes gains of 250 bps from reduced freight and raw material costs, somewhat offset by inflation and increased operating expense investment for the 2025 Always Forward Plan initiatives.For second-quarter fiscal 2023, the company expects sales growth of 4-6%. The operating margin is envisioned to be 2-3% compared to breakeven in the prior-year quarter. This is likely due to lower freight and raw material costs, partly offset by a marginal decline in the operating margin from inflation and increased operating expense investment for the 2025 Always Forward Plan initiatives.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Consequently, shares of this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company gained 22% in the past three months against the industry’s decline of 13.8%.ConclusionAll said, we hope that Abercrombie’s brand strength, store optimization efforts and other growth strategies are likely to aid growth further.  Notably, the earnings estimate for the current financial year have increased 32.9% to $1.90 over the past seven days. Topping it, a VGM Score of A reflects its inherent strength.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks that investors may consider are Tecnoglass TGLS, Kroger KR and TJX Companies TJX.Tecnoglass manufactures and sells architectural glass and aluminum products for the residential and commercial construction industries.

(NYSE:M) For Its Upcoming Dividend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dividend-investors-dont-too-quick-104805156.html,1686307685,STORY,['M'],"[It looks like Macy's, Inc. (NYSE:M) is about to go ex-dividend in the next four days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. In other words, investors can purchase Macy's' shares before the 14th of June in order to be eligible for the dividend, which will be paid on the 3rd of July.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.17 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.66 per share to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Macy's has a trailing yield of 4.1% on the current share price of $16.02. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Macy's's dividend is reliable and sustainable. That's why we should always check whether the dividend payments appear sustainable, and if the company is growing. See our latest analysis for Macy's Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Macy's paid out just 17% of its profit last year, which we think is conservatively low and leaves plenty of margin for unexpected circumstances. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Macy's paid out more free cash flow than it generated - 122%, to be precise - last year, which we think is concerningly high. We're curious about why the company paid out more cash than it generated last year, since this can be one of the early signs that a dividend may be unsustainable.Story continuesMacy's paid out less in dividends than it reported in profits, but unfortunately it didn't generate enough cash to cover the dividend. Were this to happen repeatedly, this would be a risk to Macy's's ability to maintain its dividend.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with shrinking earnings are tricky from a dividend perspective. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see Macy's's earnings per share have dropped 5.6% a year over the past five years. Ultimately, when earnings per share decline, the size of the pie from which dividends can be paid, shrinks.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Macy's's dividend payments per share have declined at 1.9% per year on average over the past 10 years, which is uninspiring.The Bottom LineShould investors buy Macy's for the upcoming dividend? It's disappointing to see earnings per share declining, and this would ordinarily be enough to discourage us from most dividend stocks, even though Macy's is paying out less than half its income as dividends. However, it's also paying out an uncomfortably high percentage of its cash flow, which makes us wonder just how sustainable the dividend really is. With the way things are shaping up from a dividend perspective, we'd be inclined to steer clear of Macy's.Although, if you're still interested in Macy's and want to know more, you'll find it very useful to know what risks this stock faces. To help with this, we've discovered 3 warning signs for Macy's that you should be aware of before investing in their shares.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

Beauty ELF as the Bull of the Day and Macy’s M as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation BVH, Inspired Entertainment, Inc. INSE and VirTra, Inc. VTSI.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:e.l.f. Beauty is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that operates as a cosmetic company. The company offers eye, lip, face, face, paw, and skin care products.The stock has had an amazing run, up over 300% since June of 2022. The move started in the back half of last year, but continued in 2023, helping ELF up over 90% year to date.The question for investors after this move is if there is any meat left on the bone. And if so, what are some good entry points for investors to get in.About the CompanyELF was formerly known as J.A. Cosmetics Holdings and changed its name to e.l.f. Beauty in April 2016. The company was started in 2004 and is headquartered in Oakland, California.The stock has a Zacks Style Score of “A” in Growth and “A” in Momentum. Value investors will shy away from this one as the Forward PE is 60. This gives the stock a Zacks Style Score of “F” in Value.ELF employs over 300 employees and sells its products through national and international retailers and direct-to-consumer channels, which include e-commerce platforms.Q1 Earnings BeatIn late May, ELF beat earnings by 110%. This was the ninth straight EPS beat that stretches back to 2021.Looking at the quarter, the company reported EPS of $6.88 v the $6.76 expected. Revenues came in at $2.63B v the $2.61B and the company affirmed its outlook. Same Store Sales were up 9.3% and management cited the strength of the beauty category, business model, product line, and loyalty program as reasons for the outperformance. The company affirmed its FY23 EPS, SSS, capex, and store openings.Story continuesMerchandise inventories did increase, but management commented this was to support higher demand, product cost increases, 41 net new stores, new brand launches, and brand expansions.Analyst EstimatesAnalysts loved the quarter and took their estimates and price targets higher.Since earnings, estimates for the current quarter have gone from $0.47 to $0.56 or 19%. However, for the next quarter, we see only a 5% jump over that same time frame.Looking at the current year, we see estimates heading 10% higher over the last month. Analysts have hiked from $1.62 to $1.78 since earnings were reported. For next year, numbers have been taken to $2.08 from $1.98 a month ago. This is a move of 5% to the upside.Since earnings, multiple analysts have taken price targets higher for ELF:JPMorgan Chase reiterated ELF with Overweight taking their price target to $102 from $87.TD Cowen reiterated ELF with Market Perform, lifting their price target to $105 from $70.DA Davidson maintained a Buy and raised the price target from $121 to $124.The TechnicalsThe stock has gone up at a 45-degree angle since June of last year.Recently making highs of $108.43, most of the short sellers have been taken out of the name. In fact, the short interest is only at 4% of the float. While the stock might go higher from here, at some point we will see a sell-off so let’s look at some buyable levels.The $96 level is where the 21-day resides. If the recent highs hold, this level would align with a halfway-back retracement drawn from the pre-earnings levels to highs. If this spot were to fail, watch the $91 level, which is the 50-day moving average.For those looking for a larger move, the 200-day is at $63. This is not likely unless we get a broad market move lower.Bottom LineCosmetics have been one of the hottest segments of the market over the last year. The momentum is strong and ELF likely continues higher over the near term.Its hard to chase at current levels, so investors should watch for buyable pullbacks to take advantage of the long-term trend.Bear of the Day:Macy’s is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that is an omni-channel retail organization, that operates stores, websites, and mobile applications. The company trades in a wide range of merchandise, including men’s, women’s, and children’s apparel and accessories, cosmetics, home furnishings, and other consumer goods.The stock is bouncing after a bad earnings announcement late last week.

There is likely more selling to show itself after the squeeze higher is over.Additional content:What's Common Between BVH, INSE and VTSI?When stocks appreciate notably in a relatively short period of time, it makes sense to ask ourselves why did it happened. For all you know, this will help you stumble upon opportunity that your normal screening activity didn’t pull up. That’s what had me taking a closer look at Bluegreen Vacations Holding Corporation, Inspired Entertainment, Inc. and VirTra, Inc..BVH’s share price jumped 5.8% during the course of the past week, INSE jumped 5.9% while VTSI did the best of the lot, with a markup of 7.0%.As the next step, I wanted to check out what brokers think about these companies. Because brokers often have field knowledge/experience and prepare advanced models that help them understand the fundamentals of a company and calculate/project the performance of its stock, consulting broker opinions is always a good idea. And so, I discovered that the average broker rating on all three stocks is 1, which translates into a Strong Buy rating. Hurray. That means brokers are thrilled with these stocks.If brokers are rooting for these stocks, in all probability, they will be raising their estimates on them. Most of us who have been following the markets for some time have figured out that it is these estimate revisions that tend to push up share prices. Even if it doesn’t happen immediately – in fact in many cases it doesn’t happen immediately – share prices definitely do ride up higher in response to positive estimate revisions. Here too I wasn’t disappointed. In just a period of 30 days, 2023 estimates for Bluegreen, Inspired Entertainment and Virtra have climbed a respective 2.5%, 14.6% and 95.7%. Virtra estimates for 2024 are only just available now, but Bluegreen and Inspired estimates are showing increases of 3.3% and 11.9%, respectively. Alright, VTSI looks most attractive from this perspective and BVH the least. But they’re all still worth considering.For additional drivers, I decided to check the industries to which these companies belong. As most of us already know, there are certain factors within an industry that tend to lift all players, or at the very least, these factors make a difference in the company’s overall operation. They could make life easier or tougher for the players.Bluegreen for example, belongs to the Leisure and Recreation Services industry. This is the summer and everyone is going on vacation. Need I say more! But here at Zacks, there’s also a system of rating industries. And Zacks says this industry deserves to be in the top 23% of the 250 odd industries that it classifies. Again, Inspired Entertainment belongs to the Technology Services industry, which Zacks has placed in the top 43%. While still in the upper hemisphere, this position is obviously not as exciting as the first. But we can take heart from the fact that historically, it has been seen that the bottom half underperforms the top half by approximately 1:2.That brings us to Virtra, which is placed in the Electronics – Military industry, which is the cream of the cream (top 1%).No prizes for guessing the winner here!Finally, let’s turn to valuation. Because no matter how great a stock is, this may not be the best time to buy it. It’s best to always pick stocks that are appreciating although still undervalued (which means that they are trading below their potential). There are a number of ways to check a stock’s valuation, some more complicated than others. But we’ll stick to the simplest method, i.e. price-to-earnings ratio (P/E). So let’s get down to it:Bluegreen’s 7.79X P/E trades at a 69.0% discount to the industry’s 25.11X P/E and a 59.0% discount to the S&amp;P’s 18.98X. While trading at a 17.5% premium to their median value, the shares should not be considered overvalued because this is well below the annual high, especially given that the company’s prospects continue to improve.As far as Inspire Entertainment is concerned, its not surprising that its P/E of 12.59X hugely trails the industry’s 46.0X because the industry valuation appears very high. Therefore, it’s encouraging that the shares also trade at a 33.7% discount to the S&amp;P 500. They also happen to be trading somewhere between their median and high points over the past year, indicating that upside potential cannot be ruled out.Virtra shares trade at 16.18X P/E, a 14.8% discount to the S&amp;P 500 and a 1.3% discount to the industry’s 16.39X. They’re also trading at a discount of 17.5% to their own 12.59X median value over the past year. Therefore, the shares are definitely undervalued. Finally, all three carry a Zacks Rank #1, which is a Strong Buy rating from Zacks. Therefore, there’s only one way to conclude this piece and that is by recommending you go for these stocks.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

130,2ccd643a-e859-392b-8664-eb4737e0fbcb,GD,2023-06-09,Is Now The Time To Look At Buying General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-time-look-buying-general-110016229.html,1686308416,STORY,['GD'],"[General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$233 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$204. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether General Dynamics' current trading price of US$214 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at General Dynamics’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for General Dynamics Is General Dynamics Still Cheap?Good news, investors! General Dynamics is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $306.40, but it is currently trading at US$214 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Another thing to keep in mind is that General Dynamics’s share price may be quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What does the future of General Dynamics look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 28% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for General Dynamics. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since GD is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GD for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy GD. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the track record of its management team, in order to make a well-informed buy.If you'd like to know more about General Dynamics as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

131,e2fc6064-a5ed-3581-9e80-0550774dc3e7,GD,2023-06-09,General Dynamics (GD) Arm Wins $11.8M Deal for Knifefish UUV,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-dynamics-gd-arm-wins-164300007.html,1686242580,STORY,['GD'],"[General Dynamics Corporation’sGD business unit, Mission Systems, recently clinched an $11.4-million modification contract involving Knifefish unmanned undersea vehicle (UUV).Per the deal, GD will provide services for the Knifefish Block 0 to Block 1 retrofit performance. Majority of work related to the deal will be performed in Quincy, MA.The contract, which is expected to be completed by June, 2024, has been awarded by the Naval Sea Systems Command, Washington, D.C.Significance of Knifefish UUVKnifefish is a medium-class Mine UUV designed for deployment off the Littoral Combat Ship. The Knifefish UUV provides the mine warfare commander with enhanced mine-hunting capability by detecting, classifying and identifying buried mines and mines in high clutter environments.Knifefish gathers environmental data to provide intelligence support for other mine warfare systems. Such remarkable features that encourage intelligence support for mine warfare systems may have led to multiple order wins for GD involving the Knifefish, like the latest one. Such contract wins should boost General Dynamics’ revenue generation prospects from the UUV business arena.What’s Favoring General Dynamics?Military spending witnessed a stark increase in the past few years to modernize and upgrade nations’ defense system, across the globe, to meet the current warfare requirements. In such a scenario, the demand for mine countermeasures system for the littoral combat ship also increased manifold.Per the reports from Markets and Markets, the UUV market is anticipated to witness a CAGR of 16% from 2022-2027 period. General Dynamics stands to benefit from the solid growth prospects that the UUV market is offering, with the company being the prime contractor of the Knifefish UUV that offers advance mission-critical solutions for the navy.Another defense stock that is likely to benefit from the expanding UUV market is:BoeingBA: Its Echo Voyager is a fully autonomous extra-large unmanned undersea vehicle (XLUUV) class UUV that can be used for a variety of missions that were previously impossible due to traditional UUV limitations. Echo Voyager is complete with an extensive internal and external payload volume and available energy capacity, expanding the parameters of what is possible in current unmanned undersea systems.Story continuesThe long-term earnings growth rate of Boeing is pegged at 4%.

Yahoo Finance Live takes a look at the market as the closing bell rings.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]SEANA SMITH: So let's do the check-in on the markets. Just about two minutes to go until the closing bell, we're looking at gains across the board. The Dow up at just shy of 200 points. S&amp;P adding to the gains just below that 4,300 level that many on the Street are closely watching. The NASDAQ adding just about 1% today.When you take a look at the sector action technology, one of the outperformers in today's trading action, consumer discretionary, not too far behind. But Akiko, a lot of investors out there, traders, just questioning this hype, this outperformance that we have seen in technology since the start of the year. A lot of that driven by the excitement around AI and whether or not there's enough momentum to continue here to the upside.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I feel like we've heard the word ""bubble"" a few times this week. But it really is about, you know, how much-- how can you really differentiate between some of these names that have claimed to be sort of right at the foundation of AI. Nvidia 1 obviously, that's gotten a lot of attention, the Microsofts, the Alphabets. But some of these other names that are sort of smaller players in AI, but that is going to continue. We have heard companies sort of push out the word to try and sort of get the hype going. So we're going to continue to watch that as well.I should point out some other sectors that we're watching today. Energy, another one. Oil, we did see it down about 2% here, Brent crude at $75 a barrel. Oil WTI at 71. And this is kind of, you know, on the back of the OPEC discussion that we continue to see. The $80 a barrel level is where OPEC would like it. But we're still seeing some downward pressure on that front.Story continuesOverall, on the day, though, some positive gains, as Seana pointed out, across all three majors with tech and consumer discretionaries leading the gains.[BELL RINGING]SEANA SMITH: All right. Well, that calls today's trading day. Again, all three of the major averages ending to the upside the Dow up 167 points off the highs of the session. S&amp;P up about 6/10 of a percent. NASDAQ outperform on the day, up just about 1%.The chicken on some of the individual movers. And first up, casino stocks. Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands closing the day lower. They were downgraded to hold from Bae at Jefferies. Analyst there, David Katz, citing the new normal in casino stock, saying that the recovery in the gambling hug hub has been, quote, ""approximately priced in at these current levels."" We're seeing a bit of pressure today. Akiko, Las Vegas Sands has outperformed since the start of the year, up just about 20%. But I guess, he sees the recovery already priced into this stock.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. I mean, a lot of this is really about their exposure to the Chinese market, specifically Macau, which is increasingly a bigger chunk of the revenue. And, you know, to the point that you just made, Jefferies saying that a lot of that has already been baked in. There's been concern about how quickly that recovery has been picking up, not as quickly. But we've heard over and over in the second half of the year, at least the China reopening story is likely to accelerate.Now, [INAUDIBLE] lot of that has already been priced in, at least according to the analyst at Jefferies. And you see right there, hold rating with a price target of $65 a share on Las Vegas Sands.]"
133,fe57924c-e934-3947-a977-d4455987f8ac,WYNN,2023-06-09,Carvana & Lucid shares rise: Top tickers,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/carvana-stock-rises-lucid-shares-202629472.html,1686255989,VIDEO,"['LVS', 'CVNA', 'WYNN', 'LCID']","[Carvana shares rise after the company reported an updated outlook for the year. Lucid shares also rose after Reuters reported the company plans to join the EV market in China. Yahoo Finance Live breaks it all down.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Let's take a look at shares of Lucid, closing the day lower today, down nearly 2% after the US luxury electric vehicle maker's head of China operations said the company was preparing to enter the world's largest car market. According to a ""Reuters"" report, Lucid will sell imported cars in China, may even consider opening a production plant there.The natural question, I think, that comes to mind is, OK, how big of a threat is this to Tesla? We should point out Lucid has a very, very high price tag. This is sort of the top tier of the EV market.But when you think about how many cars were sold last year alone with Lucid, we're talking 4,300 vehicles in 2022. So we're still talking about a very small footprint. But it is interesting to see how they're trying to compete in the Chinese market, at least according to this report, and potentially produce cars there too.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, well, can certainly be a huge growth opportunity here for Lucid, which has been struggling to really capitalize on some of their momentum here. When you take into account the fact that China is the largest market out there for cars, obviously, entrants into this space would be good news here for investors. You've got to question, though, demand right now.Recovery in China has been slower than we had initially expected it to be. The numbers that Lucid is going for is still low, especially when you compare it to so many of the other EV makers, Tesla there, but also the Chinese EV makers as well. They're planning to produce more than just around 10,000 cars this year.So they've got a long runway just in terms of when they make a larger footprint, larger impression within the EV space. But unlocking that potential in China would be very, very welcome news, and huge opportunity here for Lucid.Story continuesAKIKO FUJITA: I mean, premium, premium price tag.SEANA SMITH: Very, very top of the line. [INAUDIBLE]AKIKO FUJITA: All right, Carvana is getting a big boost today, closing the day well in the green after the company updated its financial outlook-- now expecting total gross profit per unit above $6,000 in Q2 and adjusted EBITDA above $50 million. Let's bring in Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre for more. Quite the stock today, Ines.INES FERRE: Yeah, that's right. Well, Akiko, a record gain today for Carvana in a one day gain, up 56% today after the company updated its outlook. Now, Carvana had said before that it would reach positive adjusted earnings in Q2 in 2023. But the outlook that was given today put in a figure on that-- that would be above $50 million, as you just mentioned.And what this is showing, really, is that the company has been on a cost cutting plan, strategy. It laid off workers last year. Last year, the stock had gotten completely decimated over concerns of a bankruptcy-- possible bankruptcy, over concerns of tightening credit. Now, that's the headline, right?But what happened was with the stock, as you see a headline like this, the stock goes up, and the short sellers get squeezed. So you saw a short squeeze on this stock, because it is-- Carvana continues to be a heavily shorted stock-- more than-- around 60% of the float. So, , look the stock had entered the year at around $4 a share. It is up 425% year to date.We have seen these short squeezes before with this stock. When there's a positive headline, the short sellers that are betting that the stock will go down-- when the stock goes up, they're forced to cover their positions, buy back those shares, and, therefore, that exacerbates the price to the upside.

CEO Elon Musk.“This really needs to stop. Killing some cows doesn’t matter for climate change,” he wrote in a tweet.Climate change is a pressing global issue that requires immediate attention, but instead of culling cattle, there are alternative approaches to address this challenge. Here’s a look at three green stocks that are actively tackling the issue.Check out:Elon Musk has reportedly bought 6,000 acres of land just outside of Austin. Here's how to invest in the city's growth before he floods it with new tech workers.Investing in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. With as little as $100, average investors are becoming landlords thanks to this Jeff Bezos-backed startup.Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA)According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), 28% of America’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 came from the transportation sector — and particularly from burning fossil fuels for cars, trucks, ships, trains and planes.The EPA estimates that a typical passenger vehicle emits approximately 4.6 metric tons of carbon dioxide per year.Tesla is helping resolve the issue by producing electric vehicles (EVs), which have no tailpipe emissions.The company is making an impact. In the second quarter of 2023, it delivered 466,140 vehicles, representing an 83% increase year over year.Tesla has been one of the more volatile names in the stock market. Shares fell a staggering 65% in 2022 but are up 145% in 2023.Story continuesFirst Solar Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR)Solar energy can play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. One reason is that it produces no emissions during the power generation process. And according to the United Nations, life-cycle assessments of solar power “clearly demonstrate that it has a smaller carbon footprint from ‘cradle-to-grave’ than fossil fuels.”First Solar’s solutions help humans harness the power of the sun. The company produces solar panels, including those used in utility-scale solar power plants.The business brought in $548 million in net sales in the first quarter of 2023. For the full year, net sales are projected to be between $3.4 billion and $3.6 billion.The stock market had a choppy ride over the past year, but First Solar investors probably aren’t complaining. Over the past 12 months, shares have surged more than 170%.Nextera Energy Partners LP (NYSE: NEP)NextEra Energy Partners was created by energy company NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE: NEE) to own, manage and acquire clean energy projects that generate steady cash flows.Today, NextEra Energy Partners’ portfolio holds interests in wind, solar and energy storage projects in the U.S., along with natural gas infrastructure assets in Texas and Pennsylvania.Because natural gas is not considered a renewable energy source, NextEra Energy Partners is not a renewables pure-play. But it recently announced plans to become one.“To lead this transition, we are launching a process to sell our natural gas pipeline assets, and we are suspending incentive distribution rights fees to NextEra Energy through 2026,” John Ketchum, chairman and CEO of NextEra Energy Partners, said in a press release.The partnership also stands out for its cash payout to investors.NextEra Energy Partners currently pays quarterly distributions of 84.25 cents per share, giving the stock an annual yield of 5.8%. Management expects to grow the distribution per unit by 12% to 15% per year through at least 2026, although they mentioned that given the current capital market environment, the growth rate will probably be “at or near the bottom end of this range.”NextEra Energy Partners stock is down about 17% in 2023. If you like oversized dividends but aren’t a fan of the volatility associated with publicly traded companies, you might want to look into reliable income plays outside the stock market — such as investing in rental properties with as little as $100 while staying completely hands-off.Read next:Elon Musk Is Bullish On Austin.

Jennifer Barker, BNY Mellon CEO of Treasury Services and Wole Coaxum, MoCaFi's CEO and Founder tell Yahoo Finance Live about their new partnership.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]BRAD SMITH: Recently, MoCaFi raised 23 and a half million in a series B-round with new strategic investors like BNY Mellon. The Fintech company focuses on strengthening access to banking for people without bank accounts, hoping to close the racial wealth gap. Joining us now, we've got MoCaFi founder and CEO Wole Coaxum and BNY Mellon CEO of Treasury Services Jennifer Barker to discuss more on the unbanked situation in the United States.Great to have you both here with us in studio. First, just to set the stage, walk us through what MoCaFi does for those who may not know.WOLE COAXUM: Oh, so first, it's wonderful to be with you this morning. MoCaFi is really focused on figuring out how to close the wealth gap in this country. I'll give you a great example of what we do. In the city of LA, then-Mayor Garcetti said, I want to create a way for folks to have single sign-on for city services, a way for individuals to receive monies from the government electronically, as well as a way for them to pay for city services electronically.There are 500,000 people that don't have bank accounts. MoCaFi created a platform to address that issue. So now, through something called the Angeleno Connect Program, which we are responsible for, every Angeleno has access to getting resources from the city.We need the largest universal basic income program in the country. We were able to take emergency rental assistance dollars. Over $70 million were distributed to Angelenos. At the same time, we have a demand deposit account that is open to everybody.We don't check the check system. We're able to open accounts for undocumented individuals. And we have a fee-free ATM network that includes our partners, such as Wells Fargo. And so, we've also turned local stores into bank branches, where someone can go into a bodega or a Walmart or a CVS and make deposits as if they're going to a bank account.Story continuesSo it's that kind of service, using government, using partners like BNY Mellon and others to bring banking services to those who don't have them traditionally and make it easy for government to provide those benefits to individuals.JULIE HYMAN: That's really interesting. And it's something that I think we don't think about a lot of the time, right? So what role is BNY Mellon playing in all of this?JENNIFER BARKER: So we are partnering with MoCaFi to do a couple of things. And one of the major industry problem statements is exactly what Wole described in terms of reaching un and underbanked population. Today a lot of that's done through paper check and there's a lot of issues around that.So with our agenda of innovation as a Treasury services business, we issued the first real-time payment. We have a lot of firsts. And so, we wanted to partner with MoCaFi on this and tackling this problem statement as a first, which is reaching the underbanked population quickly, efficiently, and much more cost-effectively.BRAD SMITH: There are often reasons to why someone might be unbanked or underbanked as well. And even as we move through or try to move well past the turmoil that ensued in mid-march for the banking sector here, what are you hearing from customers who wants to engage with the bank but have more questions about making sure that they're engaging with the right bank as well?JENNIFER BARKER: Sure. So Wole, I think you were in had some insight into that question about that.WOLE COAXUM: Oh, absolutely, so 80% of the bank branches that have closed in this country have been in low and moderate-income communities. So if you wanted to have a banking experience and you walk down the street, there's no place to go. You see a check cashier. You see a pawn shop. And depending on your community, you see a payday lender.Those institutions have replaced traditional banks. And so, what we're hearing from people is hey, why don't you build a product and service that suits my needs, that's open when I'm open, that's digital because I'm very adept in terms of digital services?And so, we've reimagined that. And the partnership with Bank of New York Mellon allows us to do this at a massive scale. Right? And so, now working with the oldest bank, the largest bank in terms of back-end infrastructure that makes the economy work.We're able to say, what we're doing in Los Angeles or what we're doing in Birmingham, we could bring to New York, we could bring to New York State, we could bring to Maryland, and we could bring it to the federal government. So it's a game changer in terms of new entrants in the market working with established players to reimagine bringing millions of people into the financial mainstream.JULIE HYMAN: So Jennifer, you guys are the pipes, basically, is what we're saying here, is that MoCaFi is the connection to the people. And then, you guys are back-end.JENNIFER BARKER: So we have the scale and the reach across our government clients and partnering to disperse all different types of aid, whether it's emergency aid or other types of aid. We also have corporate clients, who this is a big problem statement for themselves. If you think about a large grocery store chain and the percent of the workers who may not have a bank account or un and underbanked, And so, we have this scale in distribution to bring that solution to the market in partnership with Wole.WOLE COAXUM: And just to give you a really tangible example. Just think about in places like New Orleans. And even in New York, now that we're experiencing the benefit of wildfires in Canada and the impact that that's having here on residents here. That creates a state of emergency, where you need to get resources to people so they can weather the storm if you will.And so often, we see that resources get to people after a disaster happens not before. And in New Orleans is why I brought it up. Some people say it's a privilege to evacuate because they don't have the resources. The partnership we're talking about here puts us in a position to get resources to people before something happens, which is A. Safer for them and B. Less cost, less expensive.Because if you can get somebody out-- it's cheaper to get somebody out.JULIE HYMAN: Before the road's been destroyed or whatever-- yeah, yeah, yeah.WOLE COAXUM: And you got to helicopter them in. Got to put helicopters in to get people out. So there's a lot of wins in terms of the kinds of things we're imagining putting together.JENNIFER BARKER: And those individuals aren't waiting on a check anymore. And you would imagine in that situation, trying to find somebody's address and wait for the Postal system, now, boom, it's loaded on your digital wallet. So it's immediate access.BRAD SMITH: We only have about 30 seconds here but 23 and half million in the series B-round. Talk to us just about the model right now as it stands. How do you get to profitability?WOLE COAXUM: So we get to profitability in partnership with BNY Mellon, being able to take the solutions we just described to states to the federal government and allows a policy fulfillment of getting that-- it's almost a trillion dollars goes-- is made available to underserved communities in this country and not all of it's getting to them.And if we can facilitate that, everybody wins. We get to profitability. We get more customers into the banking system. The resources that the federal government and state government get to people who are in need it. And we are a stronger society as a result.JULIE HYMAN: Thanks for coming in you guys. Really interesting stuff.]"

139,bcebc317-2600-3102-b953-97d01e25e2fd,SPGI,2023-06-09,Corporate disclosures highlight heavy use of supply chain financing,FreightWaves,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/corporate-disclosures-highlight-heavy-supply-211131572.html,1686258691,STORY,['SPGI'],"[Supply chain financing comprised some 79% of Keurig Dr Pepper's accounts payable in Q1 2023. (Shutterstock)U.S. corporate bankruptcies thus far in 2023 are their highest since 2010, according to a new report from S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence. S&amp;P 500 earnings were down year over year in Q1 and are expected to continue falling in Q2. Financial conditions are tightening, in the form of higher interest rates and more stringent lending standards. U.S. economic fundamentals are likely to deteriorate further in the months ahead as student loan payments resume and higher auto loan rates eventually adversely affect borrowers. And already-high corporate debt levels are arguably understated. As evidenced by elevated corporate bankruptcies as well as recent dividend cuts and share repurchase freezes, liquidity risks are rising.U.S. corporate debt excludes a widely used tool called supply chain financing (SCF) that’s come to light thanks to a recent rule from the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) effective in the first quarter of this year. The more familiar one becomes with SCF, the more it resembles debt; buyers are effectively borrowing from their suppliers on a short-term basis, pulling forward free cash flow in the process. As The Wall Street Journal recently wrote, SCF is “essentially a form of short-term borrowing to pay for goods and services from suppliers.”A FreightWaves analysis of S&amp;P 500 companies’ Q1 filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission revealed about $80 billion of obligations associated with SCF programs concentrated among 84 companies, and that figure excludes several prominent companies (including Procter &amp; Gamble) that haven’t yet been required to disclose any such programs owing to the timing of their fiscal year.Furthermore, the $80 billion is understated because some companies disclosed a different (read: lower) number than what FASB required. FASB wrote that “a buyer is required to disclose the amount of [SCF] obligations that it had confirmed as valid to a finance provider or an intermediary that is outstanding at the end of a period (the outstanding confirmed amount) …” Instead, several companies disclosed the amount of their outstanding payment obligations that their suppliers had elected to sell; we assume that in almost all cases, the number that FASB required is larger than what these companies chose to disclose.Story continuesConsequently, we think the amount of SCF outstanding among S&amp;P 500 companies likely exceeds $80 billion, and perhaps is comfortably north of $100 billion.Why does this issue matter to investors?Corporate leverage is high even excluding SCF, and corporate profitability is declining owing to the deteriorating global economy as the positive effects of the massive global government stimulus have worn off. Furthermore, the cost of SCF programs has risen sharply owing to the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes over the past year and a half, and the availability of these programs could diminish as banks are under increasing stress. Importantly, supply chain financing is an uncommitted line of credit, which means banks can withdraw it at any time (unlike other types of bank financing). What would happen if companies lost access to SCF? Some would likely have to draw on their revolving lines of credit or issue bonds, such that investors ought to be aware of how much undrawn credit exists relative to the size of the SCF outstanding in many cases.How much more expensive are SCF programs becoming?The AES Corp., a power company that had $645 million of SCF outstanding at the end of Q1, indicated in its 10-Q filing in early May that the weighted average interest rate on its SCF programs rose from 4.32% as of Dec. 31 to 6.58% as of March 31, a 225-basis-point increase in just three months. And with respect to the future availability of these programs, The Wall Street Journal reported on Monday that U.S. regulators could force large banks to hold up to 20% more capital following three of the four largest bank failures in U.S. history earlier this year; higher bank capital requirements are potentially problematic for the availability and cost of credit.Where is SCF usage most pronounced among S&amp;P 500 companies?Retailers, consumer packaged goods (CPG) companies, packaging companies and telecommunications companies. Retailers, CPG companies and telecom companies account for fully two-thirds of SCF outstanding, and SCF as a percentage of accounts payable is particularly high among CPG companies and packaging companies (along with auto parts retailers).Why might that be? Retailers, CPG companies and packaging companies are all part of the same supply chain: The retailers decide to take longer to pay their suppliers (among them the CPG companies); the CPG companies decide to take longer to pay their suppliers (among them the packaging companies); and the packaging companies decide to take longer to pay their suppliers. In other words, the pressure cascades down the supply chain, until and unless something breaks somewhere in the chain.How does SCF work in practice?Once a buyer decides to take longer to pay its suppliers, it arranges for a bank to pay them on its behalf. As The Wall Street Journal put it last year, “A third party, often a bank, pays a vendor’s invoices but takes a cut. The company pays the bank the amount that was due under the invoice, though at a later date than originally required. The bank’s cut is determined by the company’s credit rating.” Regarding the latter, the higher the buyer’s credit rating, the more economical the transaction; the prevailing interest rate is based on the buyer’s credit rating rather than on the supplier’s. If the supplier has a better credit rating than the buyer, the supplier may choose not to participate in the program.In that context, how creditworthy are the companies that are engaging in SCF programs?Their credit ratings run the gamut. Some are large, stable companies with good credit ratings (Procter &amp; Gamble and Walmart are prominent examples), whereas others are far smaller and less stable. Advance Auto Parts, which had $3.1 billion of SCF outstanding as of April 22 (which accounted for a substantial 84% of its accounts payable), just cut its quarterly dividend by over 80% and saw its outlook revised to negative by Moody’s and S&amp;P. Ball Corp., a packaging company that had $608 million of SCF outstanding (17% of its accounts payable) as of the end of Q1, has a non-investment-grade (high-yield) credit rating from Moody’s and S&amp;P, and its net debt/adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ratio was 4.7x at the end of Q1.On the topic of Advance Auto Parts’ substantial dividend cut, that was far from the only sign of retailer stress in Q1. Dollar General substantially reduced its full-year earnings-per-share guidance and canceled its share repurchase plans this year. It plans no repurchases, compared to its previous expectation of $500 million of repurchases.Left unaddressed thus far is why large, stable companies with more than sufficient cash on hand would effectively be borrowing from their suppliers on a short-term basis via SCF. We’ll use the CPG industry as an example. In an environment in which several CPG companies are using SCF to boost their operating and free cash flow, others that aren’t doing so look comparatively worse, such that they have an incentive to “keep up with the Joneses” and do what their peers are doing. Investors in CPG companies pay close attention to free cash flow yields and tend to pay less attention to the composition of that cash flow (for example, the extent to which SCF is contributing to it).The post Corporate disclosures highlight heavy use of supply chain financing appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Lockheed Martin The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Lockheed MartinIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Operating Officer, Frank St. John, sold US$3.2m worth of shares at a price of US$474 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$464. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Lockheed Martin shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Lockheed Martin Have Sold Stock RecentlyOver the last three months, we've seen notably more insider selling, than insider buying, at Lockheed Martin. In total, insider Stephanie Hill sold US$1.2m worth of shares in that time. Meanwhile insider John Donovan bought US$251k worth. Generally this level of net selling might be considered a bit bearish.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of Lockheed MartinMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. It appears that Lockheed Martin insiders own 0.08% of the company, worth about US$96m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Lockheed Martin Tell Us?The stark truth for Lockheed Martin is that there has been more insider selling than insider buying in the last three months. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. Insiders own shares, but we're still pretty cautious, given the history of sales. We're in no rush to buy! So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 2 warning signs for Lockheed Martin you should know about.Of course Lockheed Martin may not be the best stock to buy.

To skip our detailed analysis of the global power dynamics, you can head to the 10 Most Powerful Countries in the World in 2023.A vital lesson the war in Ukraine has illustrated is what the world could look like without American involvement, and what it looks like when Washington flexes its unmatched power. This is not to provide validation to the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan, but a Ukraine left on its own support would have quickly succumbed to Russian advances, with Putin’s forces handing out punishments to members of the Ukrainian resistance.Instead, we are seeing President Zelenskyy named by Time magazine as the 2022 Person of the Year for defending Ukraine and asserting its identity on the global stage. In addition to the resilience of the Ukrainians to fight invasion, Kyiv’s fightback has been significantly made possible by American support in all spheres of power. The United States’ intelligence agencies had warned of a potential invasion from Russia months in advance, which enabled Ukraine to plan effective offensives and strikes against Russian targets.The Biden administration has provided Ukraine with HIMARS missiles which have proven to be instrumental in repelling Moscow’s assault. The Ukrainian military has used these missiles made by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to hit multiple Russian ammunition depots and command posts. Of the $61 billion devoted by the U.S. Congress in 2022 to arm Ukraine, $631 million were awarded to Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to manufacture new HIMARS for Kyiv. In addition to this, the U.S., in January 2023, announced it would also send Ukraine 31 M1 Abrams tanks worth $400 million. These are produced by General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD).The situation in Ukraine has forced European countries to aggressively increase their arms procurement, which is likely to boost financial statements of various armament manufacturers. Germany's lower house of parliament approved a defense fund of over $100 billion in June 2022. You can read more on this in our list of the strongest countries in Europe by military power. This was followed by a 10 billion euros worth deal in December with Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) for its F-35 fighter jets. The U.S. is also providing military support to allies in the European Union. In August 2022, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) received an order from the American army to deliver 250 M1A2 SEPv3 Abrams battle tanks to Poland, costing $1.15 billion.Story continuesThe conflict has also shown the influence of America’s global alliance network. According to a report in February this year, a total of 46 countries had placed economic sanctions on Russia and at least 40 had provided military, financial or humanitarian support to Ukraine following Washington’s call. The sanctions appear to be working as well, with Russian president Vladimir Putin admitting that they could hurt his country’s economy. Research also concludes that economic sanctions can lead to 55% of achievement in foreign policy objectives (complete, partial and negotiated).On the corporate front, following the invasion of Ukraine in 2022, over 500 companies announced pulling out of or curtailing their operations in Russia amid investors' pressure. This included giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Dell Technologies Inc. (NYSE:DELL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), among others.

The World Bank and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development have both projected contractions in the Russian economy.Russia’s woes in Ukraine with the United States turning the tide without being directly involved in the military conflict demonstrates that military strength alone does not translate into a nation’s power. There are other dimensions as well, such as economic strength, and political and cultural influence which when paired together can prove far more decisive.Geoeconomics in the 21st CenturyThere is little doubt that economic power defines the 21st century. A growing number of countries have begun using economic tools as means to advance geopolitical interests, in what is a concept known as geoeconomics. China, for instance, in 2010, banned exports of vital earth minerals to Japan that are used in manufacturing hybrid cars in a dispute over Tokyo’s detention of a Chinese fishing trawler captain. Moreover, the country is said to ""reward"" African countries that vote with it in the United Nations, with financial aids and investments.Retaliating to western sanctions, Russia in September 2022, cut off gas exports to Europe through its Nord Stream 1 pipeline, a key artery that flows directly into Germany and accounted for nearly 35% of all Russian gas supplies to Europe in 2021. The Kremlin has also invested heavily in the annexed region of Crimea, offering financial incentives to win the support of the local population.The United States and its western allies have also led efforts to halt Iran’s nuclear ambitions through sanctions that are mainly aimed at reducing Iranian energy exports. In March this year, the U.S. sanctioned one Vietnamese, two Chinese, and two Emirati companies for their roles in trading Iranian oil and petrochemicals.The Most Powerful Countries in 2050According to a report by PwC, the world will be strikingly different in 2050 from how it is today. The global economy is projected to double in size, with the U.S. and Europe losing ground to China and India. Economic power is likely to shift to the Emerging 7, or E7 economies, which in 1995, were half the size of the advanced G7 economies. By 2015, both were relatively equal in size. In 2040 and onwards, E7 economies could be double the size of G7. Relatively smaller economies like Nigeria, Vietnam, and the Philippines are also expected to experience huge leaps in their economic rankings over the next 25 years.The United States is the undisputed superpower currently, but by 2050, the world order is likely to turn multipolar, with China and India having a greater role in shaping global affairs. China is tipped to become the largest economy in the world, holding a 20% share of the world’s GDP in terms of purchasing power parity. So its safe to say that China will be economically the most powerful country in the world in 2050. China is also expanding its political and economic influence in other regions of the world, while the US is receding. You can read more about China's growing footprint in Africa in our list of the Most Politically Influential Countries in the World.India will claim second spot, overtaking the United States which will fall to third position. Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, and Nigeria are other countries that are likely to grow in power. Economic strength is expected to reflect in military power as well. Chinese President Xi Jinping has already made clear his ambitions of setting the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on track to become the world’s strongest military by 2050.However, challenges await countries like China and India in their quest to become the so-called superpowers in 2050. Analysts believe that to become prosperous countries with high standards of living like the United States and the European world, both China and India will require to develop their social infrastructure – healthcare and education, especially.25 Most Powerful Countries in the WorldMethodologyWe have used four metrics as determinants of national power to rank the most powerful countries in the world. These are economic strength, military strength, political influence, and cultural influence. For our analysis, we assigned 40% weightage to economic strength, 30% to military strength, 20% to political influence, and 10% to cultural influence. Economic strength received a higher weight due to the fact that a strong economy is positively correlated to the other three metrics. A country that is economically strong will have political influence, can raise a strong military, and also promote its culture around the world.Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of countries has been considered to gauge economic strength. Data has been obtained from a 2021 report released by the World Bank. For military strength, we have referred to the 25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023. Brand Finance’s Global Soft Power Index 2023 (which ranks countries’ soft power on a scale of 1-100) has been used to determine political influence. Lastly, for cultural influence, we have followed the same methodology as in our list of the most culturally influential countries in the world.Here are the most powerful countries:25. NorwayEconomic Strength Ranking: 28 Military Strength Ranking: 35 Political Influence Ranking: 17 Cultural Influence Ranking: 30We start the list with Norway, one of the strongest economies in Europe with a GDP of $482 billion. It also has the fourth highest GNI per capita in the world. Much of the country’s wealth comes from its energy exports. In 2022, oil giant Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) recorded profits worth nearly $76 billion, up from $39.4 billion in the previous year. Norway is also ranked 35th on military strength in the Global Firepower Index 2023.24. MexicoEconomic Strength Ranking: 15 Military Strength Ranking: 31 Political Influence Ranking: 44 Cultural Influence Ranking: 28Mexico is the 15th largest economy in the world in terms of GDP and a major exporter in the Latin America region. It has a growing cultural influence in North America, in particular the United States, where close to 12% of the population comprises Mexican Americans. The country’s cuisines, such as tacos and burritos, are also widely popular around the world. Over 18 million tourists visited Mexico in 2022, which is testament to the country’s soft power in the world.23. United Arab EmiratesEconomic Strength Ranking: 33 Military Strength Ranking: 34 Political Influence Ranking: 10 Cultural Influence Ranking: 13The United Arab Emirates (UAE) ranks among the top politically influential countries in the world, according to Brand Finance’s Global Soft Power Index 2023. The Emirati nation ranks 13th on cultural influence. This has a lot to do with Dubai becoming a major business and tourism hub since the advent of the 21st century. The oil rich country has leveraged its economic strength to boost its military power and is a major security player in the region.22. PolandEconomic Strength Ranking: 21 Military Strength Ranking: 14 Political Influence Ranking: 33 Cultural Influence Ranking: 57Poland, with a GDP of nearly $680 billion, is the 21st largest economy in the world. It also boasts of a strong military force, with the government planning to spend $100 billion in the next decade on procurement of sophisticated weapons. Poland is one of the founding members of the United Nations, and in 2019, celebrated 20 years of accession to NATO.21. SwitzerlandEconomic Strength Ranking: 20 Military Strength Ranking: 44 Political Influence Ranking: 8 Cultural Influence Ranking: 10Switzerland is another strong European nation on our list of the most powerful countries in the world. It is the 20th largest economy in terms of GDP, and ranks seventh on the list of countries with the highest GNI per capita ($75,000). Due to its neutral posture in geopolitics, Switzerland holds significant political influence. Geneva is the global head office location for a number of international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), World Health Organization (WHO), and The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR).20. SwedenEconomic Strength Ranking: 22 Military Strength Ranking: 37 Political Influence Ranking: 11 Cultural Influence Ranking: 15Located in the Scandinavian region, Sweden is one of the most developed European countries. It ranks 15th on World Bank’s 2021 list of countries with the highest GNI per capita. A number of global corporations such as Apple Inc.

Sweden is ranked 11th on political influence, and 15th on cultural influence in our list.19. IsraelEconomic Strength Ranking: 26 Military Strength Ranking: 11 Political Influence Ranking: 27 Cultural Influence Ranking: 40The Middle East’s technologically most advanced country, Israel, is next on our list. It is the 26th largest economy in the world, and has raised a strong military due to territorial disputes in the region. Its close ties with the western world, in particular, the United States, have earned the country extensive political influence in the region. With an average income of over $43,000, Israel ranks 36th in the list of countries with the highest GNI per capita.18. IndonesiaEconomic Strength Ranking: 16 Military Strength Ranking: 19 Political Influence Ranking: 45 Cultural Influence Ranking: 19With a GDP of $1.2 trillion, Indonesia is the 16th largest economy in the world, and the biggest in the southeast Asia region. Over the years, it has used its economic strength to raise a strong military as well. In 2023, the government spent $8.8 billion on developing the country’s defense system. This includes an order for 42 Rafale jets. Indonesia ranks 19th on cultural influence, with Bali being one of the world’s most pristine tourist locations. It is the most populous Muslim majority nation in the world, which also grants it significant political influence.17. TurkiyeEconomic Strength Ranking: 19 Military Strength Ranking: 10 Political Influence Ranking: 23 Cultural Influence Ranking: 45Geostrategically located at the intersection of Asia and Europe, Turkiye is one of the strongest countries in the world, with a GDP of $820 billion. The country is also a member of NATO and the G20, which has earned Turkiye immense geopolitical clout. Erdogan’s government has, in recent years, advanced Turkiye’s cultural influence through state-backed productions of TV series. One such example is ‘Ertugrul’, which has been dubbed in four languages - Arabic, Urdu, Spanish and Russian.16. NetherlandsEconomic Strength Ranking: 17 Military Strength Ranking: 22 Political Influence Ranking: 16 Cultural Influence Ranking: 16Netherlands is next on the list. It is the 17th most powerful economy in the world in terms of GDP. It is home to Dutch multinational company Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG), or Philips. It ranks 22nd on military strength, and that is primarily due to investments made on bolstering air power. The Netherlands ranks 16th in both political influence and cultural influence.15. BrazilEconomic Strength Ranking: 12 Military Strength Ranking: 18 Political Influence Ranking: 31 Cultural Influence Ranking: 17Brazil is a major power in the South America region. With a GDP of over $1.6 trillion, it is the world’s 12th biggest economy. Brazil has leveraged its economic power to upgrade its military as well. An example of that is the government strengthening its air fleet by procuring 36 Gripen fighter jets from Sweden. Brazil ranks 17th on cultural influence. Its football team is widely popular across the world for its flair.14. Saudi ArabiaEconomic Strength Ranking: 18 Military Strength Ranking: 12 Political Influence Ranking: 19 Cultural Influence Ranking: 33Saudi Arabia is the most powerful country in the Middle East, having a GDP of close to $1 trillion. Much of its wealth is due to its oil production capacity. It is a leading member of OPEC, and in 2021 it produced 11% of the global output of oil. Saudi Arabia has also been investing heavily to upgrade its armed forces. It is ranked as the 12th most powerful military in the world. In 2022, it rejoined the list of the top five spenders on military expenditure, after having spent $75 billion on defense that year. Home to Islam’s holiest places, Saudi Arabia enjoys immense cultural influence over the Muslim world and is a leading member of the OIC.13. AustraliaEconomic Strength Ranking: 13 Military Strength Ranking: 23 Political Influence Ranking: 14 Cultural Influence Ranking: 12Australia is the largest country in Oceania. It is a member of the G20 and Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (QUAD), with India, Japan and the United States as the other three countries. It has the 13th largest economy in the world in terms of GDP. The Australian Dollar is the premiere currency of the Asia-Pacific region, and is the sixth most traded currency in the world in the foreign exchange market with a daily trade volume of $479 billion. Australia ranks in the top 15 list for both political influence and cultural influence. The country is also a heavy spender on defense. In February this year, the government placed an order for 72 F-35 jets from Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) to increase the size of its fifth-generation fighter jet fleet which currently stands at 37.12. SpainEconomic Strength Ranking: 14 Military Strength Ranking: 17 Political Influence Ranking: 12 Cultural Influence Ranking: 8Spain is one of Europe’s greatest powers due to its strengths in all four spheres studied for this article. It is the 14th largest economy in the world with a GDP closing in on $1.5 trillion. 20 countries have Spanish as their official language, which is testament of the country’s cultural influence. The government in Madrid has declared its plans to boost spending on military expenditure by doubling its defense spending by 2029.11.

The award has been offered by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $2.02 billion, the contract is projected to be completed by December 2025. Per the terms of the deal, Raytheon will supply materials, parts, and components for the 17th lot of F135 Propulsion system for F-35 Lighting II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.The company will also provide spare engines, power modules and other hardware for F-35 jets. The contract will serve the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, Non-U.S. Department of Defense participants, cooperative program partners and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.A major portion of the work related to this deal will be executed in East Hartford, CT and Indianapolis, IN.Raytheon’s Growth ProspectsCombat aircraft witnessed a surge in demand with the rapid rise in political risks and global terrorism. In this context, F-35 jets, built by America’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin LMT, enjoy a lucrative position in the combat aircraft arena and witness a steady flow of orders from the U.S. Army, seven international partner countries and eight FMS customers.Lockheed Martin has delivered 899 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 340 jets in the backlog as of Mar 26, 2023.  This reflects the solid demand that this jet program enjoys in the defense space, resulting in multiple order wins for both LMT and RTX. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Looking ahead, the production of F-35 jets is expected to continue for several years, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy.Consequently, Pratt &amp; Whitney, which builds F-35’s engine, may expect to witness more order inflows for the F-35 engine and its propulsion system in the coming days, like the latest one. This should significantly bolster this defense contractor’s top line.Story continuesPeer GrowthApart from Lockheed Martin and Raytheon, defense majors that stand to benefit from the expanding production rates of F-35 are:Northrop Grumman NOC: The company renders its expertise in carrier aircraft and low-observable stealth technology for the F-35 program. A pioneer in the development of manned combat aircraft, NOC has a tradition of providing technological leadership in all aspects of military aviation and aircraft.Northrop Grumman has a long-term earnings growth rate of 3.8%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NOC’s 2023 sales indicates a year-over-year improvement of 4.7%.BAE Systems’ BAESY: This defense major’s short takeoff and vertical landing experience, along with air systems sustainment support F-35’s combat capabilities. The company provides an electronic warfare suite for F-35, which includes fully integrated radar warning (targeting support and self-protection) to detect and defeat surface and airborne threats.BAE Systems boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 13.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BAESY’s 2023 sales indicates an increase of 25.4% from the previous year’s reported figure.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Raytheon have rose 1.3% compared with the industry’s growth of 0.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankRaytheon currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

For context: To get Starship to the Moon, the vehicle must be refueled in space before leaving Earth’s orbit. That requires multiple other Starships to be launched as tankers, in order to top off the orbiting lander with super-cold liquid oxygen and methane. That procedure, per Blue, “is undeveloped technology and has never been proven to work.”Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesNow, that technology has to work to put US astronauts back on the Moon. Blue Origin won a $3.5 billion contract to build a second human landing system for NASA, and its design also depends on transporting, storing and transferring cryogenic propellants in space.“[Blue Origin’s new contract] is a different mission with different requirements—including a later landing date—than the original ... target of 2024,” Sara Blask, a Blue Origin spokesperson, told Quartz in an emailed statement. “Refueling and transfer would be challenging for that original timeline.”The challenge: Without strong gravity, fluids separate and don’t naturally flow in any one direction. Still, creating pressure to transfer propellants—through motion, with pumps, or with changes in temperature—is straightforward for propellants that are stable as liquids. The International Space Station’s propulsion system is regularly refueled with hypergolic fuels, which are propellants that combust on contact with each other. Those substances, however, are highly toxic to humans and expensive to obtain.Modern rockets typically burn oxygen and fuels like high-test kerosene, methane or hydrogen. To maximize efficiency, these typically gaseous substances are stored as incredibly cold liquids—below -297 °F for oxygen, and -256 °F for methane—which allows more to be kept in a smaller area. But that also means their storage systems require temperature controls and are built of special materials to withstand high pressure.Story continuesOne of the biggest challenges with SpaceX’s biggest Falcon 9 rocket was managing the storage of cryogenic propellants—one anomaly led to the destruction of a satellite partially financed by Facebook. In 2019, NASA attempted to demonstrate the transfer of cryogenic propellants at the International Space Station, but the chilling system failed and the liquid methane “boiled off”—turned to gas and was vented into space.“What a pain,” Joe Laurienti, the CEO of space propulsion firm Ursa Major, said when I asked about Blue Origin’s plan to use cryogenic propellants in its new lander. The Apollo program, he noted, didn’t use cryogens because of the difficulties managing their storage; his company is building engines that work with both room temperature and ultra-chilled propellants. But NASA’s ambitions to bring large payloads back and forth from the lunar surface—Moon-base style ambitions—may require the extra power cryogens provide.SpaceX didn’t respond to questions about its in-space refueling, and Blue Origin declined requests for interviews about their plans. But one of Blue Origin’s partners on the lander program is Lockheed Martin, which is tasked with developing and operating a spacecraft that will carry cryogenic propellants from the Earth to the Moon to refuel Blue Origin’s lander.The Cislunar Propellant Transporter will be a huge vehicle, some 34 meters long and launched in two parts by Blue Origin’s as-yet-to-fly New Glenn rocket. The idea is that once Blue’s lander reaches orbit around the Moon, it will remain there to shuttle astronauts down to the surface and back again. Afterward, it can be refueled and perform its next mission.Kirk Shireman is the Lockheed executive in charge of the program, and concedes that cryogenic refueling is difficult, but says his company has the technology to solve the problem. NASA has separately hired Lockheed to demo cryogenic refueling in space, originally scheduled for later this year. (If you’re interested in helping out, the company is now advertising a position supervising the assembly, test, and launch operations for this mission.)Lockheed has long thought about this problem, mainly because of its investment in United Launch Alliance, the rocket maker it co-owns with Boeing. Executives there came up with plans to use part of the Atlas rocket as a reusable space tug. While those ideas have fallen by the wayside, ULA CEO Tory Bruno, a former Lockheed exec, recently proposed the creation of a “strategic propellant reserve” in orbit. “We’re confident this is possible and practical,” Bruno told me last year.Space advocates are a bit obsessive about in-space refueling. It’s seen as the enabler for long-term exploration of the solar system, particularly if oxygen and hydrogen can be harvested from ice on the Moon. Shireman, a former manager of the International Space Station, notes that 60% of the station’s costs are transporting payloads from the Earth. Keeping reusable (and therefore refuel-able) infrastructure in space is a critical way to reduce that cost.“It’s the key to our future,” Shireman says of his current project. “The investment we are making here certainly applies to taking humans to the Moon, but it also plays forward ... These same elements can be used to go beyond the Moon as well.”🌕🌖🌗IMAGERY INTERLUDEThe latest development in the war for Ukraine is the failure of the Kakhovka dam, apparently destroyed by an internal explosion while under Russian control. The human and ecological disaster is still unfolding, and satellites are watching from above. These images were collected by Planet before the dam’s failure on June 4, and afterward, on June 6.Image: Planet PBCImage: Planet PBCSPACE DEBRISSpaceX wins Pentagon Starlink deal. The Department of Defense is purchasing Starlink terminals and service from SpaceX for use by the Ukrainian military after previous disputes over the cost of providing internet access there since Russia’s invasion. No details were released about this contract, but it represents a key win for SpaceX’s telecom business. It’s been quite a journey since February 2022 when, according to documents Quartz obtained through a FOIA request, a SpaceX executive emailed a contact at USAID to ask, “Any chance you have contacts at the communications regulator in Ukraine or any other countries?”Starliner needs non-NASA customers. Boeing announced last week that its plans to fly astronauts on its Starliner spacecraft would be delayed by two new flaws in the vehicle’s design. The company isn’t likely to profit from its current NASA contract, so it needs to figure out how to fly Starliner on a different rocket and win some private customers if the program is to succeed financially.SLS needs non-NASA customers. Boeing’s Space Launch System did the job on the Artemis 1 mission, but a recent audit (pdf) showed the cost of the rocket continues to rise and is now at $4.2 billion per launch. Boeing and Northrop, which makes the vehicle’s solid rocket boosters, hope to cut that figure in half, but even that might not make up for anemic demand.Europe and China launch commercial space transportation efforts. The European Space Agency and the Chinese Manned Space Engineering Office are planning partnerships with private companies to transport cargo to low-earth orbit, but they may not be investing enough. Also: a rundown of potential European bidders.Earth observation’s impact is real. Two examples caught my eye.

Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero takes a look at the winners and losers among homebuilder stocks.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]RACHELLE AKUFFO: A string of strong earnings from homebuilders has powered impressive stock gains, further fueling an upbeat sentiment from Deutsche Bank analysts amid weaker housing demand. ""Yahoo Finance's"" Dani Romero joins us with Deutsche Bank's take on the winners and losers from the homebuilder stocks. Hey, Danny.DANI ROMERO: Hi, Rachelle. Well, the big hype around homebuilder stocks, it's not going anywhere. These stocks are going up. One Deutsche Bank-- one analyst, excuse me, from Deutsche Bank says, the winning streak isn't over just yet.And the reason-- why are these big gains happening? Well, builders are price-takers. So they have been slashing home prices to drive up demand. And not only that, but they've also been offering incentives, which include rate buy-downs. And that looks really attractive when mortgage rates are above 6%.So which ones are the winners and the losers? Well, let's start with the winners. These-- the reason that they are the winners is because these homebuilders have been trying different strategies to build up demand. So let's start with D.R. Horton. We have D.R. Horton, Meritage, Pulte Homes, Tri Pointe, and Toll Brothers.For example, Toll Brothers. OK. They have shifted to affordable luxury. And not only that, but they have also ramped up their spec starts. So that means that unsold homes that have at least a foundation in the ground.Pulte Group also follow suit and increasing their spec starts as well. And then if we look at Tri Pointe, the reason that's also been a big gainer is that they have expanded their footprint to Texas, the Carolinas, and potentially, Florida. So there could be some return on investment there.Now let's move over to the losers. We've got NVR. We got Lennar. And the reason is because Deutsche Bank says that Lennar-- excuse me, NVRs management is letting cash pile up on their balance sheet. So there's a little bit of this somewhat detachment there.Story continuesFor Lennar, the analysts believe that it will underperform compared to their peers like D.R. Horton. There are still two stocks that are on-- that have hold ratings, that is Taylor Morrison and KB Homes. And the reason is Taylor Morrison could face some pressure due to higher leverage, also some unfavorable business mix there too.But again, KB Homes could also underperform compared to their peers D.R. Horton and Meritage. Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So Dani, for people who are looking at these homebuilder stocks, wondering if they should get into them, are there any risks ahead that they should be aware of?DANI ROMERO: Rachelle, so if the US does tip into a recession, that could lead to job losses, and that could weaken demand. So that's just to give you some context. So on a company basis.So if there could be some risks. Let's go into, for example, D.R. Horton. There could be some impacts there. The company has expanded their footprint in Texas. So that market could face some uncertainty if we do tip into a recession.And for Toll Brothers. They have concentrated a lot on luxury. Yes, they've moved into affordable luxury but there could be some downturn there.

Here is what the firm has to say:“As stated below in the portfolio activity section, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is expected to see roughly $6 billion in COVID test sales evaporate this year, creating a headwind for margins and underlying earnings per share. As long-term owners of the business, these test sales were never part of our original investment case. The core business, our primary focus, has a clear path of growing high single digits in 2023 with durable growth beyond, in our view. We believe the current price of 23x NTM P/E , while reasonable, is also misleading considering earnings this year will be artificially depressed because of the drop in COVID testing sales. On normalized earnings, the price is lower. We anticipate underlying EPS growth of at least low-teens over the next three to five years.Lastly, we trimmed Abbott Laboratories, bringing it back to a more average position size and to also fund our increase in Thermo Fisher. Abbott is entering a year in which the company is expected to see approximately $6bn in COVID-19 test sales disappear, thus, creating a headwind for margins and EPS. That said, the core business has a clear path to growing high single digits in FY23. EPS grew at a 20% CAGR from 2019-2022, far beyond our expectations when we initiated our investment. Now, we expect a more normal growth rate of low teens EPS beyond this year. Further, management’s adeptness at allocating capital continues to impress us. We expect Abbott to drive top line growth without heavily investing in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A this year— management effectively “front-loaded” those investments in 2021 and 2022 when COVID test sales created a bolus of cash. We believe this should allow for leverage on the operating margin going forward. Combined, Abbott and Thermo Fisher now represent 7% of the Portfolio.”13.

When we first established the position in 2018, we explained that, “Although headlines remind us daily of growing threats to the business, the actual probability of this business dramatically changing in the next five years is much lower than the perceived probability. We are simply betting that the future might not be as bad as the price suggests.”Consensus FY22 and FY23 EPS estimates at the time were around $17 – $18 per share. The company reported ~ $24 in earnings in FY22, and is on pace for $26 in FY23, even as consensus estimates for the broader market were repeatedly revised lower.

Here’s what the firm said:“We started a position in DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), a medical device company that sells continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices for people with diabetes. DexCom is in the early stages of the launch of its seventh-generation device called the G7, which offers many new features, including 60% smaller size, a disposable transmitter, and 30-minute sensor warmup, among other features. We think the G7 will drive revenue growth acceleration through continued penetration in the core insulin-intensive diabetes population globally. In addition, Medicare recently decided to provide coverage of CGM for people with Type 2 diabetes who are basal insulin users, meaning people with diabetes who use insulin daily but don’t need to use insulin intensively at every meal or multiple times daily. This expanded coverage adds millions of people to DexCom’s addressable market. Over the long term, we believe DexCom will have an opportunity to expand into the even larger category of non-insulin users with Type 2 diabetes given the benefits of CGM in helping all people manage their diabetes.”10.

The company, long known as a cereal giant, is shedding legacy branding to reinvent itself and provide valuable returns.Specifically, Kellogg’s is planning to sell its North American cereals business at some point in 2023.Kellogg is focusing on its snacking business, which includes Cheez-Its, Pringles, and Pop-Tarts, and snacking in general. Snaking has held very strong in 2023 and has been an area in which consumer demand has yet to soften.Kellogg will also retain its plant-based foods business and its international cereal business. Slow-growing U.S. cereals are out, and chasing sales growth is in. That means high margins associated with those legacy cereal brands will be lost. But higher valuation multiples will now be in play for firms like Mondelez International (NYSE:MDLZ). In fact, Mondelez clearly inspired Kellogg’s move here. The company successfully executed the exact strategy Kellogg is now undertaking.Growth and the valuations associated with it are prompting the move. Mondelez has shown how fruitful the strategy can be.Story continuesSplunk (SPLK)Splunk (SPLK) logo on the company office in Santana Row.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comSplunk (NASDAQ:SPLK) remains an undervalued tech stock that can create gains for those willing to invest.

In other words, Splunk provides services that should continue to have a long runway as AI is just starting to take off.Revenues jumped by 11% in the most recent reporting period and were higher than what analysts anticipated. That indicates that Splunk is catching the leading edge of trending business. EPS figures were similarly surprising. Splunk also made a lot of cash in the quarter, with free cash flow hitting $486 million, up 253% year-over-year.

Shares trade at $112, but Wall Street expects CCI stock will trade at $150 over the mid-term. Fundamentals screener site Gurufocus places that target price a much higher $194. In short, there is an overall consensus view that Crown Castle can make investors quite a bit of money.The other strong news is that Crown Castle’s Jan. 25 outlook remains unchanged after its April earnings report.

(NYSE:MRK) Before The Ex-Dividend Date",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/four-days-left-buy-merck-105352510.html,1686308032,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before a company's record date, which is the date on which the company determines which shareholders are entitled to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Merck's shares before the 14th of June to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 10th of July.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.73 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$2.92 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Merck has a trailing yield of 2.6% on the current share price of $110.32. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. View our latest analysis for Merck Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Merck paid out more than half (54%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. Dividends consumed 63% of the company's free cash flow last year, which is within a normal range for most dividend-paying organisations.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's encouraging to see Merck has grown its earnings rapidly, up 42% a year for the past five years. Management appears to be striking a nice balance between reinvesting for growth and paying dividends to shareholders. Earnings per share have been growing quickly and in combination with some reinvestment and a middling payout ratio, the stock may have decent dividend prospects going forwards.The main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Merck has delivered 5.7% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. Earnings per share have been growing much quicker than dividends, potentially because Merck is keeping back more of its profits to grow the business.The Bottom LineIs Merck worth buying for its dividend? Higher earnings per share generally lead to higher dividends from dividend-paying stocks over the long run. That's why we're glad to see Merck's earnings per share growing, although as we saw, the company is paying out more than half of its earnings and cashflow - 54% and 63% respectively. All things considered, we are not particularly enthused about Merck from a dividend perspective.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Merck is facing. For example - Merck has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

The sector overall includes healthcare providers, health insurers, MedTech companies, pharmaceuticals, and research and development companies. The healthcare sector demonstrated resilience over the years mainly because of its defensive nature. The stable demand for medical products and services also contributes to the sector’s performance during recessionary periods. BlackRock reported that the healthcare industry outperformed the broader market over the last seven recessionary periods by an average of 10.3%.Last year’s financial turmoil altered the investment landscape as investors struggled to balance their portfolios due to persistent interest rate hikes and growing inflation. The healthcare sector emerged as one of the winners in 2022, with the S&amp;P 500 Healthcare Index falling by just 2.44%, compared with an 18.5% decline in the S&amp;P 500.Also read: 15 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy NowApart from their defensive nature, another reason for the outperformance of the healthcare sector is its adaptability to address the challenges and changes brought about by the pandemic of 2020.

It is among the healthcare stocks billionaires are loading up on alongside Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS).In May, TD Cowen raised its price target on Humana Inc.

(NYSE:HUM), up from 67 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $3.78 billion. Billionaire Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q1.14. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Billionaire Investors: 15 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational healthcare and medical devices company. In May, Morgan Stanley assumed its coverage on the stock with an Equal Weight rating and a $112 price target. The firm mentioned that the stock's valuation is now looking fair.In the first quarter of 2023, the company posted revenue of $9.7 billion and reported a 10% year-over-year growth in its organic sales on an underlying basis. The company is also a Dividend King with 51 years of consecutive dividend growth. It pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share for a dividend yield of 1.99%, as recorded on June 7.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the most popular healthcare stocks among billionaires. Ray Dalio, Cliff Asness, and Ken Griffin were some of the most popular billionaire investors having stakes in the company.Overall, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) was a part of 70 hedge fund portfolios in Q1 2023, up from 60 in the previous quarter. The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $2.37 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“As stated below in the portfolio activity section, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is expected to see roughly $6 billion in COVID test sales evaporate this year, creating a headwind for margins and underlying earnings per share. As long-term owners of the business, these test sales were never part of our original investment case. The core business, our primary focus, has a clear path of growing high single digits in 2023 with durable growth beyond, in our view. We believe the current price of 23x NTM P/E , while reasonable, is also misleading considering earnings this year will be artificially depressed because of the drop in COVID testing sales. On normalized earnings, the price is lower. We anticipate underlying EPS growth of at least low-teens over the next three to five years.Lastly, we trimmed Abbott Laboratories, bringing it back to a more average position size and to also fund our increase in Thermo Fisher. Abbott is entering a year in which the company is expected to see approximately $6bn in COVID-19 test sales disappear, thus, creating a headwind for margins and EPS. That said, the core business has a clear path to growing high single digits in FY23. EPS grew at a 20% CAGR from 2019-2022, far beyond our expectations when we initiated our investment. Now, we expect a more normal growth rate of low teens EPS beyond this year. Further, management’s adeptness at allocating capital continues to impress us. We expect Abbott to drive top line growth without heavily investing in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A this year— management effectively “front-loaded” those investments in 2021 and 2022 when COVID test sales created a bolus of cash. We believe this should allow for leverage on the operating margin going forward. Combined, Abbott and Thermo Fisher now represent 7% of the Portfolio.”13. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK)Number of Billionaire Investors: 15 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is a Texas-based company that distributes pharmaceuticals and provides other care management tools.

These stakes have a consolidated value of roughly $4 billion.Here is what Broyhill Asset Management has to say about McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) gained 50% for the twelve months ending December 2022, as opioid-related litigation concerns, which weighed on the stock for years, took a back seat to strong operating performance. When we first established the position in 2018, we explained that, “Although headlines remind us daily of growing threats to the business, the actual probability of this business dramatically changing in the next five years is much lower than the perceived probability. We are simply betting that the future might not be as bad as the price suggests.”Consensus FY22 and FY23 EPS estimates at the time were around $17 – $18 per share. The company reported ~ $24 in earnings in FY22, and is on pace for $26 in FY23, even as consensus estimates for the broader market were repeatedly revised lower. We continued to trim our position throughout the year as shares rerated higher from ~ 8x earnings in FY18 to ~ 16x earnings at recent highs.”12. Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.

(NASDAQ:DXCM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We started a position in DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), a medical device company that sells continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices for people with diabetes. DexCom is in the early stages of the launch of its seventh-generation device called the G7, which offers many new features, including 60% smaller size, a disposable transmitter, and 30-minute sensor warmup, among other features. We think the G7 will drive revenue growth acceleration through continued penetration in the core insulin-intensive diabetes population globally. In addition, Medicare recently decided to provide coverage of CGM for people with Type 2 diabetes who are basal insulin users, meaning people with diabetes who use insulin daily but don’t need to use insulin intensively at every meal or multiple times daily. This expanded coverage adds millions of people to DexCom’s addressable market. Over the long term, we believe DexCom will have an opportunity to expand into the even larger category of non-insulin users with Type 2 diabetes given the benefits of CGM in helping all people manage their diabetes.”10.

The company offered exposure to therapeutics in obesity and diabetes via the launch of Mounjaro, as well as in Alzheimer’s via Donanemab which was filed in November 2022 for accelerated Phase 3 approval in mid-2023. While the company reported decent fiscal fourth quarter results, shares detracted from performance after a modest miss in their obesity and diabetes drug. Mounjaro.

(MRK) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/merck-co-inc-mrk-trending-130012179.html,1686229212,STORY,['MRK'],"[Merck (MRK) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned -7.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.4% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Merck belongs, has lost 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -1.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.95 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -7.1%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.46 indicates a change of +21.7% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Merck, the consensus sales estimate of $14.42 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -1.2%. The $58.79 billion and $62.66 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -0.8% and +6.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $14.49 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -8.9%. EPS of $1.40 for the same period compares with $2.14 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.84 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.65%. The EPS surprise was +4.48%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, Boeing is accused of then taking the company’s technology for its own use and adapting it.Wilson has also accused Boeing of putting “lives at risk” after its adapted technology led to leaks on the International Space Station.Wilson’s products include the Fluid Fitting Torque Device for use on the space station, which it alleges Boeing adapted and stole. Various parts were overtightened in Boeing’s adaptation, the lawsuit alleges.The mismatched tools then led to fluid leaks and delays for launches related to the Space Launch System rocket, which cost Nasa “hundreds of millions of dollars”.The allegation is included in a lawsuit against Boeing field by Wilson Aerospace.David Wilson, founder of Wilson Aerospace, said: “Boeing has not only stolen our intellectual property and damaged our company’s reputation but has used the technology incorrectly and at the expense of astronauts’ safety, which is beyond despicable.“I hope that this lawsuit will put a stop to Boeing’s repeated practice of prioritising its own profits over safety.”The lawsuit claims: “Although Boeing paid Wilson for some of its work over the years, Boeing’s primary approach was to steal Wilson’s intellectual property through deception and other illegal means, rather than to compensate.”Boeing has been accused of stealing intellectual property before. In support of its claim, Wilson pointed to allegations from 2006 when Boeing was implicated in stealing thousands of pages of Lockeed Martin documents.Story continuesThe company ultimately agreed to pay a $615m (£493m) fine to end a three-year probe into the matter.Wilson Aerospace claims it has lost hundreds of millions of dollars, the company’s lawyers, Pete Flowers, told CNBC.

For context: To get Starship to the Moon, the vehicle must be refueled in space before leaving Earth’s orbit. That requires multiple other Starships to be launched as tankers, in order to top off the orbiting lander with super-cold liquid oxygen and methane. That procedure, per Blue, “is undeveloped technology and has never been proven to work.”Read moreA look back at BTS as it became the world's top-selling actYour anxiety brings 4 distinct superpowersAmericans may have seen the last of big rent hikesNow, that technology has to work to put US astronauts back on the Moon. Blue Origin won a $3.5 billion contract to build a second human landing system for NASA, and its design also depends on transporting, storing and transferring cryogenic propellants in space.“[Blue Origin’s new contract] is a different mission with different requirements—including a later landing date—than the original ... target of 2024,” Sara Blask, a Blue Origin spokesperson, told Quartz in an emailed statement. “Refueling and transfer would be challenging for that original timeline.”The challenge: Without strong gravity, fluids separate and don’t naturally flow in any one direction. Still, creating pressure to transfer propellants—through motion, with pumps, or with changes in temperature—is straightforward for propellants that are stable as liquids. The International Space Station’s propulsion system is regularly refueled with hypergolic fuels, which are propellants that combust on contact with each other. Those substances, however, are highly toxic to humans and expensive to obtain.Modern rockets typically burn oxygen and fuels like high-test kerosene, methane or hydrogen. To maximize efficiency, these typically gaseous substances are stored as incredibly cold liquids—below -297 °F for oxygen, and -256 °F for methane—which allows more to be kept in a smaller area. But that also means their storage systems require temperature controls and are built of special materials to withstand high pressure.Story continuesOne of the biggest challenges with SpaceX’s biggest Falcon 9 rocket was managing the storage of cryogenic propellants—one anomaly led to the destruction of a satellite partially financed by Facebook. In 2019, NASA attempted to demonstrate the transfer of cryogenic propellants at the International Space Station, but the chilling system failed and the liquid methane “boiled off”—turned to gas and was vented into space.“What a pain,” Joe Laurienti, the CEO of space propulsion firm Ursa Major, said when I asked about Blue Origin’s plan to use cryogenic propellants in its new lander. The Apollo program, he noted, didn’t use cryogens because of the difficulties managing their storage; his company is building engines that work with both room temperature and ultra-chilled propellants. But NASA’s ambitions to bring large payloads back and forth from the lunar surface—Moon-base style ambitions—may require the extra power cryogens provide.SpaceX didn’t respond to questions about its in-space refueling, and Blue Origin declined requests for interviews about their plans. But one of Blue Origin’s partners on the lander program is Lockheed Martin, which is tasked with developing and operating a spacecraft that will carry cryogenic propellants from the Earth to the Moon to refuel Blue Origin’s lander.The Cislunar Propellant Transporter will be a huge vehicle, some 34 meters long and launched in two parts by Blue Origin’s as-yet-to-fly New Glenn rocket. The idea is that once Blue’s lander reaches orbit around the Moon, it will remain there to shuttle astronauts down to the surface and back again. Afterward, it can be refueled and perform its next mission.Kirk Shireman is the Lockheed executive in charge of the program, and concedes that cryogenic refueling is difficult, but says his company has the technology to solve the problem. NASA has separately hired Lockheed to demo cryogenic refueling in space, originally scheduled for later this year. (If you’re interested in helping out, the company is now advertising a position supervising the assembly, test, and launch operations for this mission.)Lockheed has long thought about this problem, mainly because of its investment in United Launch Alliance, the rocket maker it co-owns with Boeing. Executives there came up with plans to use part of the Atlas rocket as a reusable space tug. While those ideas have fallen by the wayside, ULA CEO Tory Bruno, a former Lockheed exec, recently proposed the creation of a “strategic propellant reserve” in orbit. “We’re confident this is possible and practical,” Bruno told me last year.Space advocates are a bit obsessive about in-space refueling. It’s seen as the enabler for long-term exploration of the solar system, particularly if oxygen and hydrogen can be harvested from ice on the Moon. Shireman, a former manager of the International Space Station, notes that 60% of the station’s costs are transporting payloads from the Earth. Keeping reusable (and therefore refuel-able) infrastructure in space is a critical way to reduce that cost.“It’s the key to our future,” Shireman says of his current project. “The investment we are making here certainly applies to taking humans to the Moon, but it also plays forward ... These same elements can be used to go beyond the Moon as well.”🌕🌖🌗IMAGERY INTERLUDEThe latest development in the war for Ukraine is the failure of the Kakhovka dam, apparently destroyed by an internal explosion while under Russian control. The human and ecological disaster is still unfolding, and satellites are watching from above. These images were collected by Planet before the dam’s failure on June 4, and afterward, on June 6.Image: Planet PBCImage: Planet PBCSPACE DEBRISSpaceX wins Pentagon Starlink deal. The Department of Defense is purchasing Starlink terminals and service from SpaceX for use by the Ukrainian military after previous disputes over the cost of providing internet access there since Russia’s invasion. No details were released about this contract, but it represents a key win for SpaceX’s telecom business.

Boeing announced last week that its plans to fly astronauts on its Starliner spacecraft would be delayed by two new flaws in the vehicle’s design.

Massie is chair of the panel's antitrust subcommittee.""We have ... learned that the FTC worked with foreign regulators to deny U.S. companies due process,"" the lawmakers wrote in the letter requesting documents related to any contacts between the FTC and non-U.S. antitrust enforcers.Illumina Inc has appealed the FTC's order to undo the transaction in an appeals court in New Orleans.The FTC in April ruled for a second time that Illumina's 2021 acquisition of its formerly part-owned subsidiary should be undone. An administrative law judge at the FTC had earlier dismissed the antitrust charges brought against Illumina but FTC staff won an appeal against that decision.The FTC has been concerned that Illumina, the dominant provider of DNA sequencing of tumors and cancer cells that help match patients with the best treatment, might raise prices or refuse to sell to Grail's rivals. Illumina has said it has shown that those concerns are unfounded.An FTC spokeswoman said that the agency ""regularly and lawfully cooperates with international partners and has for decades under both Republican and Democratic Chairs, a practice long welcomed by the business community.

172,622defee-cdef-36d3-a697-7782f77435fb,CI,2023-06-09,5 HMO Industry Stocks to Watch as Technology Expenses Take a Toll,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-hmo-industry-stocks-watch-144600977.html,1686235560,STORY,"['UNH', 'CNC', 'CI', 'HUM', '^GSPC', 'MOH']","[The U.S. health insurance industry, referred to as Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), is expected to gain on the back of growing premiums and an expanding customer base, thanks to the well-performing Government business. The industry players have an active merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy in place. Though technology investments are made to boost operational efficiencies, these often escalate costs for industry players. Shortage of medical personnel across the United States is a concern. Despite the challenges, companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, The Cigna Group CI, Humana Inc. HUM, Centene Corporation CNC and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH appear well-placed to counter the industry headwinds.About the Industry The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of subscribers’ basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign premiums to health and medical insurance policies. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance. Services are generally provided by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.4 Trends Shaping the Fate of the HMO Industry A High Technology Expense Level: Telehealth services were prevalent in the United States prior to the COVID-19 pandemic but their usage was not as widespread as it has been since the onset of the pandemic. Per a report by Grand View Research, the global telehealth market is anticipated to witness a 24% CAGR over the 2023-2030 period. This impressive growth forecast indicates that demand for digital healthcare services will continue to be high. HMO players are therefore compelled to undertake technology investments to build telehealth platforms. Needless to say, the platforms fetch a steady revenue stream for industry players and boost their operational efficiencies. But tech investments might escalate costs and erode the margins of health insurers.Story continuesShortage of Medical Staff: A dearth in the availability of medical personnel is taking a toll on the efficient functioning of hospitals nationwide. An increase in the number of nurses reaching retirement age, greater life expectancy of the overall population and faculty shortages in nursing schools are some of the factors triggering a scarcity in the nursing workforce. Health insurers collaborate with hospitals, physicians and other facilities to offer discounted care access to plan members. Therefore, the effectiveness of services remains a crucial factor behind health plan renewals. A shortage in the nursing workforce can reduce a hospital’s ability to deliver quality care services and indirectly affect the customer base of HMO companies. Healthy membership growth is crucial to the premiums of health insurers.Rising Customer Base: Most of the participants in the HMO space distribute cost-effective health plans through their Government business and upgrade them from time to time. The strength of such plans leads to federal or state contract wins for HMO players.  Plan upgrades as well as contract wins bring in more customers for the industry participants and provide an impetus to premiums. Also, these provide them an opportunity to serve different underserved U.S. communities and bolster their geographic footprint. Given an aging U.S. population, the solid demand for Medicare plans (meant for 65 years and above), which form part of the abovementioned Government business, is expected to continue.Active M&amp;A Moves: An active M&amp;A strategy offers an opportunity for the industry players to advance their capabilities, enter new regions, delve deeper into existing ones and grow their customer base. The HMO stocks gain from diversification benefits that result from an active pursuit of M&amp;A deals and attain a competitive edge over industry peers. Though interest rates were increased aggressively by the Fed in order to tame inflation, the percentage of increase seems to have somewhat slowed down. This, in turn, is likely to bring down borrowing costs, making it easier for companies to opt for loans to finance M&amp;A deals and avoid complete exhaustion of cash reserves. According to Tom Miles and Brian Healy, Co-Heads of Americas M&amp;A at Morgan Stanley, the pace of such deals is likely to pick up in the second half of 2023 and beyond.Zacks Industry Rank Hints Bearish OutlookThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry is housed within the broader Zacks  Medical sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #181, which places it in the bottom 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Despite the dismal scenario, we will present a few stocks that one can retain, given their solid growth endeavors. But before that, it’s worth looking at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and the valuation picture.Industry Vs. Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Medical-HMO industry has outperformed the Medical sector but underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite in the past year.In the said time frame, the industry has gained 1.5% against the Medical sector’s decline of 7.5%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has rallied 7% in a year.One-Year Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry trades at 17.25X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 19.03X and the sector’s 22.32X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 21.49X and as low as 12.93X, with the median being at 17.69X, as the chart below shows.Forward 12-Month Price/Earnings (P/E) RatioZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research5 Stocks to Keep a Close Eye OnWe present five stocks from the space currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

UnitedHealth Group: Based in Minnesota, UnitedHealth Group benefits from its solid segmental performance. While a strong Government business empowers the health insurer to gain more Medicare and Medicaid customers, the Optum unit gains on buyouts and utilization of advanced technology and market-leading health analytics. A robust telehealth services suite developed through significant investments enables UNH to deliver virtual healthcare services effectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth Group’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.97 per share, indicating a 12.5% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests 12.6% growth from the year-ago actual. UNH’s earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 4.04%. Its shares have gained 3.7% in the past three months.Price &amp; Consensus: UNHZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCigna: This Connecticut-based health insurer continues to benefit from the strength exhibited by its two growth platforms, namely Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. While a solid specialty pharmacy services suite drives the growth of the Evernorth platform, the Cigna Healthcare unit benefits from a growing customer base within its U.S. Government and U.S. Commercial businesses. New collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems strengthen the capabilities of the health insurer.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cigna’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.81 per share, implying 6.6% growth from the prior-year reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests a 4.6% improvement from the year-ago actual. CI’s earnings outpaced estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 6.56%. Even though its shares have declined 3.8% in the past three months, solid fundamentals are likely to help shares bounce back in the days ahead.Price &amp; Consensus: CIZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHumana: Headquartered in Kentucky, Humana is driven by higher premiums and an expanding customer base across its Medicaid and Medicare businesses. The health insurer teams up with well-reputed organizations to launch new plans or upgrade features within the existing ones. The strength of such plans leads to numerous contract wins and renewed agreements for Humana from various federal or state authorities. A series of acquisitions undertaken over the years, including those of Family Physicians Group, iCare and Inclusa, has diversified income streams and extended the nationwide presence of HUM.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Humana’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $28.25 per share, indicating a 11.9% improvement from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests 10% growth from the year-ago actual. HUM’s earnings surpassed estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 8.87%. Its shares have rallied 3.7% in the past three months.Price &amp; Consensus: HUMZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCentene: Based in Missouri, Centene benefits from a strong Managed Care business resulting from growth in Medicaid membership and the Medicare business, and several contract wins. It follows an inorganic growth route, which, in turn, bolsters its capabilities and provides an opportunity to boost membership. A well-diversified healthcare suite and solid nationwide presence have fetched numerous contract wins, and deal renewals for CNC. The health insurer also resorts to divestitures for intensifying focus on growing its core Managed Care business.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Centene’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $6.43 per share, which implies a rise of 11.3% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests 0.7% growth from the year-ago actual. CNC’s earnings outpaced estimates in two of the last four quarters and missed the mark twice, the average being 0.59%. Its shares have rallied 3.3% in the past three months.Price &amp; Consensus: CNCZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Molina Healthcare:  This California-based health insurer benefits from higher premium revenues and a growing customer base, resulting from well-devised Medicare and Medicaid plans.

It also resorts to tactical cost-cutting measures that aid margins.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Molina Healthcare’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $20.14 per share, indicating a 12.4% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues hints at a 3.3% improvement from the year-ago actual. MOH’s earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 5.42%.

(NYSE:TEL) has announced that it will be paying its dividend of $0.59 on the 1st of September, an increased payment from last year's comparable dividend. This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 1.8%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns. Check out our latest analysis for TE Connectivity TE Connectivity's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsIf the payments aren't sustainable, a high yield for a few years won't matter that much. However, prior to this announcement, TE Connectivity's dividend was comfortably covered by both cash flow and earnings. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business.The next year is set to see EPS grow by 28.7%. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 29% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.historic-dividendTE Connectivity Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $0.84, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.36. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 11% per annum over that time. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Dividend Looks Likely To GrowInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. It's encouraging to see that TE Connectivity has been growing its earnings per share at 15% a year over the past five years. TE Connectivity definitely has the potential to grow its dividend in the future with earnings on an uptrend and a low payout ratio.TE Connectivity Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesMarket movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

Per the terms of the deal, Raytheon will supply materials, parts, and components for the 17th lot of F135 Propulsion system for F-35 Lighting II Joint Strike Fighter aircraft.The company will also provide spare engines, power modules and other hardware for F-35 jets. The contract will serve the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, Navy, Non-U.S. Department of Defense participants, cooperative program partners and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers.A major portion of the work related to this deal will be executed in East Hartford, CT and Indianapolis, IN.Raytheon’s Growth ProspectsCombat aircraft witnessed a surge in demand with the rapid rise in political risks and global terrorism. In this context, F-35 jets, built by America’s largest defense contractor, Lockheed Martin LMT, enjoy a lucrative position in the combat aircraft arena and witness a steady flow of orders from the U.S. Army, seven international partner countries and eight FMS customers.Lockheed Martin has delivered 899 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 340 jets in the backlog as of Mar 26, 2023.  This reflects the solid demand that this jet program enjoys in the defense space, resulting in multiple order wins for both LMT and RTX. The latest contract win is a bright example of that.Looking ahead, the production of F-35 jets is expected to continue for several years, given the U.S. government's current inventory target of 2,456 aircraft for the Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy.Consequently, Pratt &amp; Whitney, which builds F-35’s engine, may expect to witness more order inflows for the F-35 engine and its propulsion system in the coming days, like the latest one.

Poff; Executive VP, CFO &amp; Chief Administrative Officer; Designer Brands Inc.Justin FischerJay SolePresentationOperatorGood morning, and welcome to the Designer Brands Inc. First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please note this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Justin Fischer, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.Justin FischerGood morning. Earlier today, the company issued a press release comparing results of operation for the 13-week period ending April 29, 2023, to the 13-week period ended April 30, 2022. Please note that the financial results that we will reference during the remainder of today's call excludes certain adjustments recorded under GAAP unless specified otherwise. For a complete reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted earnings, please reference our press release.Additionally, please note that remarks made about the future expectations, plans and prospects of the company constitute forward-looking statements. Results may differ materially due to various factors listed in today's press release and the company's public filings with the SEC. The company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements. Joining us today are Doug Howe, Chief Executive Officer; and Jared Poff, Chief Financial Officer. Now let me turn over the call to Doug.Douglas M. HoweI want to begin by thanking our team for their continued hard work throughout the quarter. Given the strength of our first quarter last year, which was propelled by the strong return of fashion, coupled with this year's broad-based pressure on the consumer, we anticipated our first quarter would face headwinds. That being said, the environment was slightly more difficult than we expected. I was pleased with how our team stepped up to read and react to an increasingly promotional environment and, at the same time, manage our inventory level appropriately across both our Retail and Brand segment. In the first quarter, Designer Brands net sales declined 10.7% compared to the first quarter last year. As I just mentioned, the first quarter of 2022 was a robust period where we saw a net sales growth of 18.1% year-over-year. Additionally, our U.S. retail store traffic was up 22% last year, significantly outpacing the market. Despite the negative trend that the retail industry has been experiencing since the fourth quarter as well as the sequential down trend in February, March and April of this year, we are continuing to see increased customer demand in the casual segment of our offerings.However, the increase in casual sales were not significant enough to offset the decreases in our dress and seasonal businesses within our most important Marpril selling season.Specifically, we saw a sharp pullback in seasonal products, particularly sandals, which were down 14% in women's and down 8% in men's in the quarter in our Retail segment. Conversely, we saw strength in our overall casual category within DBI with women's up 7% and Men's up 4% in the quarter compared to the prior year, and we are leaning on our ability to flex and pivot our assortment to offer even more of the casual brands they want.To mitigate the impact of changing consumer preferences, we quickly altered course, increasing our promotional drivers as we move through the quarter.As we've mentioned frequently over the past year, we have been strategically building back our clearance inventory offering, providing our value customer segment options at lower price points, and we were able to leverage this further during the quarter. Our U.S. clearance business comps were up 5% on a net basis during the quarter compared to last year. Despite the softness in the quarter, we continued to be encouraged by the progress we are making against our long-term strategy of doubling sales of our own brands from 2021 to 2026, while editing and amplifying with our top national brand partners.We continue to see bright spots in owned brands, particularly in the casual category, and are very excited to continue integrating our new brand acquisitions into our portfolio. We're pleased with the progress we have made in the quarter, growing own brand penetration to 27% of DBI net sales. As a reminder, over the last year, we have acquired Keds, Le TIGR and Topo Athletic, all of which we anticipate will help to fuel growth for total DBI and provide for a diversified complement to our dress and seasonal powerhouse brands that will continue to benefit us over the long term. Now I'd like to briefly dive into each of these.Let's start with an update on Keds. We are continuing to integrate Keds and are pleased with the performance of the brand today. Keds saw positive wholesale growth versus its performance last year under Wolverine's ownership and is performing in line with our acquisition expectations.Keds recently launched a brand refresh focused on honoring individual expression through playful optimistic style. Our first product collection that celebrates individual self-expression is focused on the Keds Champion Sneaker, our original sneaker and icon.Keds Champion Sneaker is reinterpreted with different silhouettes, celebrating our iconic style, versatility and staying power. The Court, which launched recently, is a new style within the collection that pays homage to tennis heritage and has been success with both in-line offerings as well as our recent collaboration with recreational habits, experiencing very strong sell-through in multiple points of distribution as well as on keds.com.Le TIGRE is planned to launch in late summer, just in time for the back-to-school season. This brand provides us with another unique opportunity to offer fashion forward athletic footwear at a reasonable price point and furthers our own brand reach into the athletic category. Much like Keds, it's a heritage brand with a rich history. It offers great versatility and lifestyle and approach, and we anticipate customers will be excited to see this online and in stores.Lastly, Topo. This acquisition gives us a specialty athletic brand that we intend to lean into across channels from wholesale and DTC to Topo's already meaningful international distribution. We remain on track with our integration plans and are excited about the potential of this brand. These 3 brands will strengthen our positioning in the athletic category while moderating Designer Brands penetration to draft and season, creating less volatility related to weather and fashion trends. In fact, during the first quarter, we saw strength in our owned athletic brands relative to seasonal and dress category. In addition to these 3, we are excited to announce that we are working on closing an agreement to become the exclusive licensee of the Hush Puppies brand in the U.S. and Canada, a stellar addition to our comfort and casual categories in owned brands. Our DSW segment has been the exclusive retail outlet for Hush Puppies for over 2 years now, and this agreement now opens up the opportunity for us to wholesale the brand in the U.S., in Canada as well as operate hushpuppies.com, which will be our sixth independent e-commerce site.The Hush Puppies brand showcased robust growth in the first quarter at DSW with growth up 400%. This also brings design and sourcing of comfort casual product into our business model, which has meaningful upside for our own brand portfolio. I also want to touch on the performance of several of our legacy owned brands, specifically in the casual category.First, Lucky continues to be a standout with women's sandals up 10% to last year. We've seen trend-driven demand for Lucky motivated by the resurgence of denim and more Western style. This drove sales up 8% in our DTC channel at DSW in the first quarter compared to the prior year.Crown Vintage also performed well, and we are pleased with the momentum we are seeing as we continue our celebrity partnership with Emma Roberts, which includes her specially curated styles and storytelling around the latest spring collection. The collaboration drove 4.6 million media impressions over a 5-day period in April. We made meaningful progress in the men's space, expanding our assortment beyond dress and serving our male customer across categories with a focus on expanding the casual and hybrid assortment. We are seeing encouraging results within this category with both our Vince Camuto and Crown Vintage casual business.Vince Camuto's Men's DTC is up 87% for Q1. We are offering him a breadth of assortment in casuals across different types of construction, sporter technical construction and versatile dress hybrids. Several new styles include the introduction of our FLY 365 technology. This is an important step for our Vince Camuto brand as it is the beginning of a journey of engaging with our male customer in an expanded manner.Turning to Crown Vintage. Our men's Crown vintage business is up 32% in Q1 with the growth driven by casuals. Crown Vintage is currently the #5 brand overall for men's at DSW. In a similar way to our approach to Vince Camuto over the last year, our focus in Crown has been to grow the casual and dress hybrid assortment for the brand with a focus on natural-based materials such as canvas, chambray and other cotton-based materials.Our strength in e-commerce continued across many of our brands and our collective owned brand.com DTC performance showed solid growth compared to last year, with vincecamuto.com delivering an 8.3% comp.In addition, topoatheletic.com and keds.com both delivered meaningful new DTC sales to designer brands. As we focus our brand-building efforts, we continue to find moments to showcase our brands with engaging events, including several at the end of the quarter that generated excitement and drove traffic in stores and online.Lucky Brand celebrated festival culture during Coachella hosting a desert mirage themed event, featuring surprise performances and exclusive giveaways for guests, including a customization station for trucker jackets. The influencers and attendance were dressed from head to toe in styles from Lucky Brands festival collection, which featured footwear and handbags in crochet and natural leathers, reflecting the cool festival vibe of that moment.Vince Camuto created their own buzz at Coachella, treating VIP guests, celebrities and influencers to Coachella bella festival of fashion experience, an homage to the Vince Camuto Spring campaign titled Calbella.Additionally, in mid-April, Jessica Simpson celebrated the launch of our spring/summer 2023 collection of apparel and shoe silhouettes. The collection was inspired by Jessica's love of all things denim and features platforms, wedges and slides and amazing fabrics, bright colors and hot metallics sure to inspire our devoted Jessica Simpson customers to complement their look this season. Complementary to these own brands initiatives, we are committed to our national brand strategy and growing strong relationships with the largest national brands that are most relevant to our retail customer base. We are focused on editing and amplifying our national brands acting as a top point of distribution for our consumers. As part of our edit and amplify strategy, we are excited to build on our partnership with Nike, which strengthens our position as a leader in the footwear and athletic space.This plan will elevate in October this year. Our partnership with Nike will allow us to provide an athletic offering across men's, women's and kids that gives our customers a premium physical and digital assortment.Before I hand it over to Jared, I want to quickly touch upon our guidance that he will discuss in more detail in a few minutes. While we've had a slightly more challenging start to the year than anticipated, I am still quite proud of the quarter we delivered on top of outsized market-leading growth in the first quarter of last year. With this in mind, I am cautious about the balance of the year and mindful of several dynamics.First, we continue to see a consumer pressured by a macroeconomic environment, a factor that is now expected to be more impactful than originally anticipated. Second, the first quarter is a critical timeframe for our business as Marpril is 1 of our 2 biggest selling periods of the year. Given that we have seen weakness across our original expectations, coupled with the consumer continuing to lean into value, we will continue to leverage and increased promotional and clearance strategy in the second quarter.As a result of these elements, we are lowering our sales and earnings guidance for 2023. That being said, we do believe these trends are temporary and expect to see improvements later in the year.With that, I'll pass it over to Jared. Jared?Story continuesJared A. PoffThank you, Doug, and good morning, everyone. I want to reiterate Doug's comments and echo how proud we are of this organization's ability to manage through the current challenging macroeconomic environment. We remain on the path to evolve our business model as we demonstrate the power of our brand-building capabilities, and I am pleased with the progress we have made on our journey to date. As you heard from Doug, it was a challenging first quarter, particularly on the top line, and our adjusted EPS came in slightly below our expectations at $0.21. But the strong first quarter performance last year in both our retail and wholesale segments, coupled with the challenges of the current environment, we had communicated that the first quarter would most likely be our most difficult by far from a year-over-year comparison on both the top and bottom line. We continue to feel that this is the case. However, Q1 was slightly more challenging than anticipated and the trajectory change into Q2 is not materializing as originally projected. From a retail perspective, we continue to react to the constrained discretionary consumer and saw an increasingly promotional environment across most of our retail peers. Additionally, we had an especially pressured March as weather did not support our all-important Marpril expectations. This is a peak holiday for seasonal product, a category in which we dominate and over-penetrate. From a wholesale perspective, we met expectations, which were down to last year due to many of our retail partners assuming a conservative stance with near-term inventory adjustments.Now let me provide a bit more detail on our financial results. For the first quarter, sales decreased 10.7% to $742.1 million compared to 2022, primarily as a result of the aforementioned pressures on consumers, inventory tightening across the industry and a highly promotional retail environment.For the quarter, total retail comps were down 10% on top of a strong 15% comp in the first quarter of 2022. U.S. retail comps specifically were down 12% for the quarter, driven by the same pressures. However, on a 2-year stacked basis, comps were up 2%. Canada had a strong quarter, posting comps up 3% on top of a robust 41% comp gain last year.Finally, the performance of vincecamuto.com continued to be positive with comps up 8%, which was particularly noteworthy given last year's comp gain of 20%. Consolidated gross margin was 32% in the first quarter compared to 33.2% last year, a decrease of 120 basis points. While much of this decrease was planned given the work we had been doing since fall of last year rebuilding our clearance business, we also saw some deleverage in the quarter given the promotional environment and deleverage of our fixed store occupancy cost.More importantly, gross margin continues to be structurally more robust than prepandemic with consolidated gross margins up 230 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2019. Our adjusted SG&amp;A ratio for the first quarter was 28.9% of sales compared to 26.8% in the first quarter of 2022. Although we have deleveraged SG&amp;A with a decrease in sales, we have recognized a significant cut in our expense base from 2022 as we continue to find opportunities to trim costs across the entire business.For the first quarter, adjusted operating profit was 3.5% of sales compared to 6.6% in the prior year. For the first quarter, we had $6.6 million of net interest expense and our effective tax rate on our adjusted results was 25.7% compared to 29.3% last year. Our first quarter adjusted net income was $14.3 million or $0.21 per diluted EPS versus $36.7 million or $0.48 last year.Turning to inventory. We ended the first quarter with inventories of $637.4 million compared to $672.5 million last year. On a retail square footage basis, we ended the quarter down 4% versus the first quarter of 2022. Wholesale inventories ended the first quarter up 15%, but adjusted for the acquisitions of Topo and Keds, inventory would have been down 27% to last year.As we manage through the uncertainties of this year, we feel good about our inventory position heading into the second quarter. We ended the quarter with $50.6 million of cash and our total liquidity, which includes cash and availability under our revolver was $250.9 million. As of the end of the quarter, we had $200.3 million available to draw on our revolving credit facility. As a reminder, we continue to await the receipt of our remaining $40 million of our CARES Act tax refund due to us from the IRS, which we expect as soon as the standard audits of the applicable prior tax years conclude.Before I conclude, I want to share a few remarks on our updated guidance. As we discussed last quarter, our original guidance assumed a pullback in consumer spending through the first half of the year with a soft landing in the third quarter and a modest return to growth in the fourth quarter. With the first quarter performing slightly below our expectations and uncertainty continuing to linger, we believe that the recovery in consumer discretionary spending may be delayed. As a result, we are lowering our guidance. We have taken the appropriate steps to manage those factors under our control, including prudently managing our inventories and tightening up expenses across the board.As a result, the largest uncertainty lies squarely with the discretionary consumer. Accordingly, we are widening the range of our guidance to reflect this uncertainty and are now guiding to an adjusted EPS of $1.20 to $1.50 per share. As you might expect, sales in our U.S. Retail segment remained the largest uncertainty for the balance of the year. In contemplating the high end of our guidance, we have taken into consideration the slightly slower start to the year that we experienced in Q1 and slower-than-anticipated starts to recovery in Q2.However, the top end of the range still assumes that the consumer returns to a more normalized buying patterns in the fall that, when coupled with increasingly easier comparables to last year, result in a return to net sales growth in the fall versus last year.More specifically, this assumes sales at our U.S. Retail segment down mid-single digits to last year and consolidated sales at Designer Brands, excluding Keds, are down mid-single digits as well. On the lower end of our guidance, we have assumed that the consumer doesn't recover as quickly. This would result in fall delivering slightly lower sales than last year, albeit still much improved comp performance over spring given our newly elevated Nike relationship, opportunistic closeout buys we have secured, the extra week in the fiscal calendar and easier comparables to last year than we experienced in the spring. The low end of our range assumes sales at our U.S. retail segment down in the high single digits to last year, consolidated sales at Designer Brands, excluding Keds, also down in the high single digits to last year. I will now touch on the assumptions we've made for the other parts of our business within our guidance range. Regardless of the scenarios within our Canadian retail business, we expect sales to be relatively flat to down low single digits to last year, given the continued post-COVID recovery that geography is experiencing. Additionally, in our Brands segment, given the conservative posture with which we entered the year, we are not revising our guidance much. We now expect external wholesale, excluding Keds, to be down to fiscal 2022 by approximately 20% versus the down 15% to 20% in our original guidance and we still anticipate our vincecamuto.com DTC site to be relatively flat to last year.As a reminder, we closed on the Keds acquisition at the beginning of the fiscal year. Since the acquisition, we are pleased to say that Keds has been delivering as expected, and we continue to expect Keds to add approximately $75 million to $85 million of net sales across multiple channels, including wholesale, DTC, international and Canada.As I noted previously, it should be highlighted that while we are excited about this acquisition and will recognize these incremental sales, we are not anticipating a material impact to profitability from these sales in the current year as a result of cost and investments related to the integration process.With an estimated tax rate of 29.8% and approximately 69 million weighted average shares for the year, we arrived at our revised EPS guidance range of $1.20 to $1.50 per share. All of the guidance just discussed excludes the impact of the anticipated Dutch auction tender offer that we announced earlier today and related debt raise, which I will now discuss.After a thoughtful consideration and discussion with management and our Board of Directors, later today, we expect to launch a Dutch auction tender offer. We believe this represents a significant investment in our own stock that will allow us to efficiently and effectively increase value for our shareholders. We intend to offer to repurchase up to $100 million in value of our Class A common stock at a price between $7 and $8 per share under our existing share repurchase authorization. The repurchase is conditioned upon obtaining financing, which we look to finalize with a $135 million term loan agreement prior to the expiration of the tender offer.The details of the anticipated tender offer can be found in the accompanying press release. As we navigate these uncertain and challenging times, we will continue to operate with a focus on growing value for our customers as well as an emphasis on managing our expense base and our inventory levels in both our retail and wholesale segments. I continue to be excited about the investments we have made in our brand portfolio, and I'm looking forward to continuing the momentum of these latest acquisitions to support and diversify our revenue streams.With that, we will open up the call for questions. Operator?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Jay Sole from UBS.Jay Sole_Great. Maybe just to start off, I'm interested if you can elaborate a little bit on this elevation of partnership with Nike? Can you just maybe tell us a little bit about how it came together? And I think before Nike was 6% of sales, maybe 7% of sales, I mean are we going to have a full reversal and go back to that level of sales with Nike? And if you can sort of give us some detail around that, that would be helpful.Douglas M. HoweHey Jay, thanks for the question. This is Doug. Obviously, we're very excited about the changes that the teams are making in the overall product portfolio, elevating our relationship with Nike is obviously among them.It just really came -- they've been great partners. We've had ongoing dialogue for the past several months. And we're super excited to be able to bring that back across men's, women's and kids. That will happen in Q4. So kind of November available to the customer. So again, they've been great partners. We're excited to be able to offer that across stores and digital. We'll thoughtfully, with their partnership, build that business back. We're going to be focusing obviously on, like I said, men's, women's and kids. Big opportunity, I think, for both of us, just given our #3 market share penetration in women's. And the customer will vote that come, we'll continue to evolve our portfolio with them and other partners as well. But obviously, very excited about that.Jay SoleGot it. And then maybe just going to follow up on that. You talked about -- just you want to touch on the guidance a little bit. You mentioned that the trajectory change in the business that perhaps you've been anticipating for Q2 hasn't yet materialized. Can you just talk about what you're seeing and sort of like what hasn't happened? And then maybe also talk about when you said there's an increasingly promotional environment, like what categories are you seeing that in? And sort of where are you noticing the most kind of increase in promotions?Douglas M. HoweYes. This is Doug again. Thanks, Jay. It's pretty equally spread across the categories, to be honest with you. I mean we're definitely seeing strength in buoyancy in the casual area. That casualization trend just continues. And men's, women's, kids all very, very similar, which to us really just points to she's being much more discretionary with their income, right? And it's fairly broad based.I think the good news on that is we feel like there's parts of that, that are in our control, obviously, when that rebounds. We're being very thoughtful about our promotions, obviously, to be able to manage through that. We've always been known for value. So we certainly want to lean into that as a core competency. But I think we're just seeing a little bit of (inaudible) for demand. We had a lot of reasons to believe as we move through the back half of the year. Teams have done an amazing job of rebalancing the inventory, both on the retail side and on the brand side, leaning into that casualization.So feel really good about the work the teams are doing there. We're going to be launching an exciting fall marketing campaign. Obviously, excited for the first time to be able to launch an own brand in the athletic space with Le TIGRE. And then as we said, really excited about elevating our relationship with Nike as we move into the back half of the year.Operator(Operator Instructions) There are no more questions in the queue. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Doug Howe for any closing remarks.Douglas M. HoweThank you. Well, hopefully, you heard through our remarks. Consistently, we are obviously focused on product. We're excited to continue to elevate our national brand portfolio through the relationship with Nike. As I said, we're looking forward to launching Le TIGRE. First time we've launched a known brand in that athletic space in August of this year. And I'll just close where I began by thanking our team for their continued hard work and dedication. I also want to thank our amazing brand partners, and thanks to all of you for joining us today, and we look forward to updating you our progress next quarter.OperatorThe conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.]"

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Toro: mixed.

181,793666f1-1548-3cfd-b6a1-0639e8f339a7,NKE,2023-06-09,How Lululemon took on Nike to become a Fortune 500 company and $8 billion athleisure empire,Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lululemon-took-nike-become-fortune-120000665.html,1686225600,STORY,"['LULU', 'NKE']","[To understand how Lululemon Athletica has successfully built an activewear empire while bucking the turmoil rocking most apparel makers, it’s instructive to assess how the company handled the biggest disappointment in its history.With Americans forced to exercise from home in 2020, Lululemon purchased the smart fitness platform Mirror for $500 million, hoping to get in on the at-home fitness craze propelling companies like Peloton and Tonal. In addition to a new line of business, the deal’s rationale was to drive more buyers of Lululemon clothing. It was the apparel company’s first major M&amp;A transaction—but was ultimately a troubled one. Once the pandemic receded, Americans flocked back to their gyms and boutique fitness studios, leaving the digital fitness startup struggling to attract users. Since the acquisition, Lululemon has taken write-downs almost equal to Mirror’s price tag, meaning Mirror is now nearly worthless in accounting terms. (Media reports have said Lululemon is looking to sell Mirror. The company declined to comment.)“The acquisition has not fully materialized as originally intended,” Lululemon CEO Calvin McDonald conceded to Wall Street analysts in March. But in a display of pragmatism, Lululemon rebranded the product as Lululemon Studio and is pivoting to focus on Mirror’s subscription app rather than the hardware. “We view Lululemon Studio in the same way we view any innovation. We test, we learn, and we evolve,” McDonald said.While Mirror has been a rare misstep under McDonald, the shift in strategy underscores a willingness to take risks and course correct quickly, which are qualities that have propelled the Vancouver-based company to the very top tier of sportswear brands, and now, for the first time, into the Fortune 500. The company placed at No. 461 in the newly released 2023 ranking on the strength of $8.1 billion in revenue last year. That’s nearly triple its revenue when McDonald took the helm in 2018, a success that doubled Lululemon’s stock price over the same period.Story continuesAnd McDonald has big ambitions: He told investors in 2022 that he plans to hit $12.5 billion in revenue by 2026 as Lululemon becomes an ever more formidable rival to Nike and leaves competitors like Under Armour in its dust. “Our fundamental approach to innovation is through the lens of the guest and innovating unmet needs. We look to where we’re being pulled in versus pushing,” McDonald told Fortune last year.Lululemon’s branding as a hip retailer targeting a wealthy clientele has been vital to its growth, hence why the company is credited with the invention of “athleisure,” at the intersection of good fit and high-quality fabrics. It’s slowly expanded into menswear and, more recently, golfing and hiking clothes. And it’s building brand loyalty through community, with moves such as in-store classes and running groups.“They’ve managed to find the right combination of looking good but not having too much fashion and being strong with technical qualities [of garments],” says Stacey Widlitz, president of SW Retail Advisors.Lululemon’s test-and-learn approach, and its resistance to the “analysis paralysis” that has slowed many other retailers’ adaption to new consumer tastes, have helped the brand boom. Lululemon’s performance contrasts with the sharp decline in sales in the past year at rival brands like Gap Inc.’s Athleta and despite the arrival of up-and-comers in the higher-end activewear space like Vuori, Rhone, and Alo Yoga.“They have taken each new category, ticking them off one by one, and killed it,” Widlitz says. That’s precisely how Lululemon gained 2.3 percentage points of market share in the activewear category in late 2022, according to data from NPD Group.One such category is menswear. After all, one cannot reach $12.5 billion in annual sales on women’s yoga pants alone. When Lululemon launched that business in earnest in 2014, it faced formidable odds as a brand closely associated with the $50 Pilates class, ladies of leisure set. Becoming a dual-gender brand is challenging, and sports retailers like Nike and Under Armourstill struggle to attract women shoppers as much as they do men. Nine years ago, Lululemon gingerly launched its sophomorically named “anti–ball crusher” (ABC) pants before expanding into shorts, shirts, and other activewear for men.Now Lululemon’s men’s bottoms are everywhere, becoming standard wear for male office workers seeking comfortable but professional attire. And its running shorts are fixtures at marathons and gyms across the U.S.Lululemon’s next foray into a risky category would further bring it into more direct competition with Nike: footwear, a product group where Lululemon has little history and which has a more complex production cycle and supply chain than apparel. “It’s a different animal. Footwear is much more complicated and harder to make money on,” says Marie Driscoll, managing director of Coresight Research’s luxury and retail practice.Lululemon last year dipped its toes in the category by launching four women’s shoe styles. It has added more this year and will launch men’s shoes next year.One thing that has analysts worried is whether Lululemon is chasing too many new categories at once. “They’ve pushed into so many categories and keep testing and pushing into new ones. They do it in a smart way, but it will be interesting to see how they manage that, because you can’t be all things to all people,” says Widlitz. “You can’t go deep in every category.”Another big prong in McDonald’s plan is making Lululemon a global player. Canada, its home market, and the U.S. together generate 86% of its revenue. But Lululemon sees tremendous opportunities abroad, notably in the U.K. and China. “Lululemon has ample runway to quadruple its international sales, driven by outsized gains in China,” wrote Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Poonam Goyal in a research note. Last quarter, international sales rose 60%. Lululemon already has 100 stores in China, which generate 8% of global sales, and business has boomed after the country’s post-pandemic reopening.Despite Lululemon’s upward trajectory, and even if the company hits McDonald’s 2026 revenue goal, the retailer will remain a fraction of the size of Nike, which Wall Street expects to ring in about $50 billion in sales this year. But Coresight’s Driscoll thinks Lululemon has what it takes to compete with Nike for dominance eventually.“They’re becoming a global brand, and they have a very strong relationship with women and a growing relationship with men. There are some things Nike could learn from Lululemon,” she says.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

But that doesn't change the reality of under-performance over the last twelve months. In fact, the price has declined 44% in a year, falling short of the returns you could get by investing in an index fund.The recent uptick of 15% could be a positive sign of things to come, so let's take a look at historical fundamentals. See our latest analysis for Zions Bancorporation National Association To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Unhappily, Zions Bancorporation National Association had to report a 5.4% decline in EPS over the last year. This reduction in EPS is not as bad as the 44% share price fall. So it seems the market was too confident about the business, a year ago. The less favorable sentiment is reflected in its current P/E ratio of 5.34.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on Zions Bancorporation National Association's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Zions Bancorporation National Association, it has a TSR of -42% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveInvestors in Zions Bancorporation National Association had a tough year, with a total loss of 42% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 3.9%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 6% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

Wade, activist investors are pushing companies to disclose the impact new abortion rights laws could have their businesses. Yahoo Finance legal reporter Alexis Kennan breaks down what investors want to know.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, the constitutional right to abortion was revoked last year when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade. Now as we follow up on, this activist investors are pushing major companies to disclose the impact the new limitations have on their businesses. Joining us now is Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan to break it all down for us. Hey, Alexis.ALEXIS KEENAN: Hi, Rachelle. So yeah, the number of shareholder proposals that relate to abortion access, they doubled from last year's proxy season to this year's. And the number this year reached about 30. And the big takeaway here is that all of the proposals and Yahoo Finance's counted about 16 of them, all of them that went to a vote, they said no to the idea of requiring that companies explain the financial as well as reputational risks that they face now that women have no constitutional right to abortion.Now take a look at some of the companies that face these types of votes. They go across industries. Meta, Google, Costco, Home Depot, Coca-Cola, Pfizer, Walmart and Comcast as well. Comcast just had its vote yesterday. Preliminary results show also a no there to these issues.Now let's talk specifically about what these measures entail. By and large, these proposals, they sought disclosures from these companies on matters like how companies handle abortion-related customer data in response to law enforcement or potential law enforcement requests, also how their political contributions to candidates conflict with their company's stated values, also how state abortion limitations can impact hiring as well as retaining and relocating workers, and also on the other side of the issue, the potential risks of even supporting abortion.Story continuesSo altogether, Yahoo Finance reviewed about these 30 proposals that were on the table this year. Some of them though were withdrawn before a vote. And in some cases, those withdrawals can be seen as a success by their proponents because they forced companies to make some changes. And one of those is CVS. They faced a proposal, but before it went to a vote, the company agreed to provide some greater protections around their customers' health care data.But certainly this is part of a wider ESG push. But we're seeing on both sides of the political and ideological aisles here, these issues coming to a fore. But just a huge uptick this year in the number of abortion related matters on the table that doubling from last year. Just a significant, significant change despite the fact that these were virtually all no-votes so far. Rachelle?RACHELLE AKUFFO: Certainly a lot of people seeking some clarity here, at least not getting it for now. A big thank you, Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. Thanks so much.]"

(NASDAQ:PYPL) is not merely adapting, but spearheading a remarkable turnaround. By embracing Web3, blockchain technology and strategic investments, the payment giant is set to capitalize on digital transactions. With a keen focus on user base expansion, enhanced merchant acceptance and international growth, the company has fortified its position as a market leader. Moreover, its strategic investments in cutting-edge companies across various financial sectors provide an additional catalyst for sustained growth.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with PYPL. Click here to check it out. PYPL 15-Year Financial DataThe intrinsic value of PYPLPeter Lynch Chart of PYPLPayPal: A Promising TurnaroundPerformance and management's long-term focusOne of the key indicators of PayPal's potential turnaround is its expanding user base and increased engagement. For the first quarter of the year, the company reported 433 million active accounts, representing a 1% year-over-year increase. Moreover, the total payment volume increased by 10% over the same period, indicating higher user activity and engagement.These data points suggest PayPal's turnaround depends on acquiring new users and increasing the activity level of its existing user base.PayPal: A Promising TurnaroundSource: Investor update.Another area showing signs of progress was merchant acceptance. Active merchant accounts grew by 6% year over year, reaching 35 million in 2022. This growth demonstrates that more merchants are adopting PayPal's services, providing convenience and trust for customers and merchants alike. The increasing merchant acceptance further solidifies the company's position in the market and supports its long-term value growth.Additionally, mobile payments may become a significant driver of PayPal's growth. In the first quarter, Venmo payment volumes increased 9% year over year. This statistic highlights the company's ability to capture the mobile payment market and adapt to changing consumer preferences. With the increasing prevalence of smartphones and the convenience they offer, its strong presence in mobile payments fundamentally supports a potential turnaround in the company's valuation.Story continuesFurther, PayPal's international expansion efforts may also continue to yield positive results. The company experienced 6% year-over-year growth in international total payment volume in the first quarter. This data suggests PayPal's services are resonating with customers globally, and its global expansion strategies effectively tap into new markets. Additionally, strategic partnerships with popular e-commerce platforms and digital wallet providers may extend its reach further and facilitate its growth in international markets.Notably, PayPal's TPV growth across each segment of its business in the first quarter is a vital positive indicator. International and cross-border growth, as well as growth in branded checkout and Venmo, contributed to strong TPV growth. This expansion in transaction volumes and customer base suggests PayPal's efforts to attract and retain users may lead to a significant improvement in its valuation.PayPal: A Promising TurnaroundSource: Investor updateWeb3 adoption and blockchainPayPal's recent foray into the Web3 and blockchain space through strategic investments in Chaos Labs and Magic reflects the company's astute recognition of the growing significance of decentralized finance and efforts to capitalize on the potential of Web3 technologies. These investments are clear indicators of PayPal's focus on remaining at the forefront of the evolving financial landscape and expanding its service offerings to cater to the changing needs of its customer base.Chaos Labs, a pioneering automated economic security system for crypto protocols, addresses the escalating risks and vulnerabilities faced by DeFi platforms. With prominent DeFi clients such as Aave, Chainlink and Uniswap, the company has firmly established itself as a trusted player. The $20 million seed funding round, jointly led by Galaxy and PayPal Ventures, will enable Chaos Labs further to develop its suite of risk and security products. This strategic move aligns harmoniously with PayPal's core objective of providing secure and reliable financial services to its customers within the crypto realm.Similarly, PayPal's investment in Magic, a wallet-as-a-service provider, highlights the company's keen interest in simplifying the onboarding process for Web3 applications. Magic's secure and user-friendly solutions empowers companies to transition their customers into the Web3 ecosystem effortlessly. The $52 million strategic funding round led by PayPal Ventures may greatly bolster Magic's ability to expand its enterprise offerings and accelerate the mainstream adoption of Web3. This move harmonizes perfectly with the company's broader strategy of embracing digital assets and spearheading the widespread acceptance of cryptocurrencies.Looking ahead, PayPal's active involvement in the Web3 and blockchain spaces positions it to capitalize on the burgeoning demand for decentralized financial services and Web3 applications. By investing in specialized companies like Chaos Labs and Magic, PayPal is expanding its product portfolio and establishing strategic partnerships and collaborations with key industry players. This enables it to leverage these companies' technological advancements and expertise to enhance its own services and provide innovative solutions to customers.Further, by proactively staying ahead of the curve and embracing emerging technologies, PayPal aims to maintain its competitive edge and effectively adapt to the ever-evolving needs of consumers. This forward-thinking approach solidifies the company's position as a leader within the fintech industry and lays the foundation for future growth and innovation.Several key data points underpin the long-term advantages of PayPal's pivot towards Web3 adoption and blockchain technology. First, through investments in companies like Chaos Labs and Magic, PayPal Ventures strategically positions itself within the emerging Web3 ecosystem. This strategic positioning enables the company to tap into the potential of DeFi, a sector experiencing rapid growth and continuous innovation. By supporting startups that provide risk management solutions and wallet-as-a-service offerings, PayPal may become a significant player in the rapidly expanding digital economy.Additionally, integrating cryptocurrency transfers into the PayPal and Venmo platforms signifies a substantial opportunity for the company to diversify its revenue streams. As increasing numbers of customers embrace cryptocurrencies, the seamless and secure transfer of digital assets enhances the overall user experience and attracts a broader customer base. This move aligns seamlessly with the surging demand for digital assets and strengthens PayPal's position as a leading player in the digital payments space.Progressive strategic investmentsPayPal's strategic investments in Finanzguru, Deep Instinct, Mintoak and Aspire demonstrate its commitment to implementing a sustainable turnaround and expanding its reach in various financial industry sectors.Finanzguru, Germany's leading open-banking-enabled financial advisor, has experienced remarkable success, boasting 1.5 million registered users and achieving tripled revenues in 2022. PayPal Ventures' investment in Finanzguru may accelerate profitable growth in Germany, expand its product platform and strengthen its team. The move aligns with PayPal's strategy of supporting fintech companies that provide personalized financial advice and enhance access to financial services. The company's impressive user base and revenue growth indicate a strong market demand for their services, presenting an opportunity for PayPal to tap into the German market and broaden its customer base.Deep Instinct, a cybersecurity company leveraging deep learning for threat prevention, has also gotten PayPal Ventures' attention. The key data point that bolsters this investment is Deep Instinct's unique ability to detect and prevent cyber threats earlier than other solutions. By adopting a prevention-first model, Deep Instinct aligns perfectly with PayPal's focus on cybersecurity. This investment signifies the company's confidence in the disruptive technology offered by Deep Instinct and its potential to drive the cybersecurity industry forward. Deep Instinct's superior threat detection capabilities present an invaluable asset to PayPal in safeguarding its systems and protecting customer data.Mintoak, an India-based SaaS platform catering to merchant services, has secured funds through a Series A funding round led by PayPal Ventures. This investment aims to empower Mintoak to strengthen its technology stack, expand its product portfolio and enter new markets in the Middle East, Africa and Southeast Asia. The data point that supports this investment is Mintoak's significant growth potential and its ability to serve small and medium-sized enterprises while assisting banks in delivering comprehensive business solutions to their customers. As the Indian fintech market continues to thrive, PayPal's investment in Mintoak positions it to leverage the burgeoning opportunities in the expanding merchant segment.PayPal: A Promising TurnaroundSource: Investor update.Specific risks and downsidesPayPal faces several specific risks and downsides that may impact its turnaround efforts and long-term growth.The regulatory environment is a big concern as governments worldwide scrutinize the fintech industry and impose stricter regulations on data privacy, anti-money laundering and financial transactions. Compliance with these regulations can be costly and time-consuming, potentially impacting PayPal's profitability and growth.Additionally, operating margin pressure is a significant downside for PayPal, as the data reveals a decline in its margins due to increasing expenses. The company has been investing in technology, marketing, customer acquisition and compliance, which significantly pressures its profitability. Dependency on partnerships is both an advantage and a risk for PayPal. The company collaborates with e-commerce platforms and digital wallet providers to expand its user base and transaction volume.PayPal also faces competition from alternative payment platforms such as Block Inc.'s (NYSE:SQ) Square and Stripe. These platforms offer similar services and are gaining traction. Losing market share to these competitors could hinder the company's ability to reaccelerate growth.Furthermore, the data suggests the growth of PayPal's active users (active accounts) has slowed. This decline indicates a potential saturation of the company's market reach. Acquiring new users is crucial for sustaining long-term growth, and any stagnation or decline could hinder PayPal's turnaround efforts.TakeawayIn conclusion, PayPal's strategic investments in Web3 adoption, blockchain technology and various areas of the financial industry, coupled with its expanding user base, improved merchant acceptance, mobile payment dominance and international expansion efforts, reflect its commitment to driving sustainable growth and innovation.However, the company faces market saturation, regulatory challenges, margin pressure, evolving consumer preferences, slower revenue growth and competition from alternative payment platforms. Despite these challenges, PayPal's proactive approach, focus on emerging technologies and strategic investments position it well for the future, while continuous adaptation and customer-centric strategies will be vital for sustaining its turnaround.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

JPM, and Murphy USA MUSA.3 Top-Ranked Stocks with Bullish CatalystsOne way to enhance investing returns is to pick stocks that have multiple bullish factors aligning for them.Molson Coors, JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co., and Murphy USA all have a litany of bullish catalysts on their horizon. From earnings upgrades to technical chart patterns, and secular macroeconomic tailwinds, each of these stocks has a few things going for them.Additionally, they represent a diverse selection of market sectors offering a broad range of options for investors to select from.Molson CoorsMolson Coors is a globally recognized brewing company that boasts a rich history spanning over two centuries. Known for its portfolio of iconic beer brands, including Coors, Miller, Blue Moon, and Molson Canadian, the company has a strong presence in North America, Europe, and other international markets.TAP operates through various subsidiaries and joint ventures, enabling it to tap into diverse markets and consumer preferences. With a commitment to brewing excellence, innovation, and sustainability, the company continues to introduce new and exciting products to meet evolving consumer demands.Tap just broke above a major level of resistance that has been holding it down for the last four years. Additionally, after pushing above the $60 level of resistance, it traded back down retesting the level and pushed higher again. This indicates that resistance has turned to support and is a very bullish development.Molson Coors currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), indicating upward trending earnings revisions. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 11.7% and are expected to grow 20% YoY. FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 7.6% and are projected to climb 7.3% YoY.TAP is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 15x, which is below the market average, and just above its 25-year median of 14x. Additionally, Molson Coors stock has a dividend yield of 2.5%.Story continuesJP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. is one of the largest and most renowned banking institutions in the world, with a history that spans over two centuries. As a global leader in financial services, JPM offers a comprehensive range of banking, investment, and asset management services to individuals, businesses, and institutional clients.JPM’s diverse business portfolio includes consumer banking, commercial banking, investment banking, and wealth management, among other areas. With a strong presence in both domestic and international markets, JPM leverages its extensive network to provide innovative financial solutions.After surviving, and even benefiting from the recent turmoil in regional banking sector JPM is building a very bullish technical chart pattern. Considering JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. absorbed in billions of new deposits and purchased a large debt portfolio at a discount following the banking debacle, it’s no wonder investors are interested in buying stock in the financial behemoth.JPM stock has cleared two major levels of resistance and has constructed a tight consolidation. If the stock can clear the $141 level, it should go on a nice bull run. Alternatively, if the price trades below $137.50 investors can expect the stock to trade back down into the range.JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. has seen some substantial upgrades in its earnings estimates, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Analysts seem emboldened by JPM’s resolute actions during the banking crisis and have boosted expectations accordingly.Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 6.6% and FY23 earnings have been upgraded by 11.5%. If JPM can reach expectations it would reflect a 28.6% YoY increase in current quarter earnings, and an 18.2% YoY increase in FY23 earnings. Additionally, current quarter sales are projected to climb 20%, while FY23 sales are projected to grow 14.5%.Murphy USAMurphy USA MUSA is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. Murphy USA markets refined products through a chain of retail stations, almost all of which are located near a Walmart supercenter, primarily in the Southeast, Southwest and Midwest United States. As of Dec 31, 2022, the company had more than 1,700 retail fuel stations encompassing 27 states.The company, which caters to approximately 1.6 million customers daily, also owns a dedicated line space on the Colonial Pipeline - the largest refined products system in the country and the biggest gasoline mover.MUSA has been an incredibly strong stock over the last five years, considerably outperforming the industry and broad market. That performance is likely to keep up over the next few years as the energy market could remain supply constrained going forward.Just this week OPEC+ announced that they would be cutting daily oil output by 1 million barrels per day, lighting a fire under oil prices. Additionally, the gross underinvestment in oil and gas infrastructure over the last decade caused by ESG initiatives, has limited oil and gas infrastructure investments tremendously. Investments in new oil projects take 3-5 years before yielding considerable production, so supply is likely to stay tight for some time.Murphy USA is trading at a one-year forward earnings multiple of 14.7x, which is below the market average of 20x, and below its five-year median of 16x. Considering how much MUSA stock has appreciated over that period it is extremely impressive it has maintained such a reasonable valuation.This is because of the explosion in earnings MUSA experienced between 2019 and today, where annual EPS grew from $5.26 to $26.82 per share. And if oil prices remain elevated investors can expect those profits to remain high as well.Bottom LineBy utilizing the Zacks Rank #1 List, investors can find new stocks with strong near-term expectations daily. By doing a bit more diligence and finding companies with additional bullish catalysts, investors can really boost their odds of trading winning stocks.Why Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

With the three largest US-based companies joining forces, it will put pressure on other companies to ditch the industry’s previous standard, called CCS, and build out their networks using Tesla’s system.Collaborating also knocks down a possible barrier to car buyers, some of whom worry about adequate charging on America’s roadways, Barra said.“This collaboration is a key part of our strategy and an important next step in quickly expanding access to fast chargers for our customers,” the GM CEO said in a statement. “Not only will it help make the transition to electric vehicles more seamless for our customers, but it could help move the industry toward a single North American charging standard.”It will also add millions of drivers to Tesla’s existing charging network. GM plans to have production to build 1 million EVs in the US in 2025. Ford has similar ambitions for 2026.The agreement is “another win for Tesla,” analyst Mark Chadwick wrote in a note on Smartkarma. “Positive all round and will help further cement Telsa’s BEV dominance.”Story continuesBarra said GM will talk to its partners about working with Tesla’s charging network. It had recently announced a joint venture with Pilot and EVgo Inc. to add 2,000 chargers nationwide. The Detroit automaker works with other charge networks in addition to EVgo.For Tesla, the deal will improve use of its charging network and add charging revenue from motorists, a GM spokesman said.Tesla’s network will be open to GM EV drivers starting in 2024 and require an adapter, the companies said. Starting in 2025, GM will build its electric vehicles with a port for direct access to Tesla Superchargers.Last month, Ford CEO Jim Farley went on Twitter Spaces alongside Musk and made a similar announcement, moving the auto industry toward a single charging standard.Shares of charging network operators that compete with Tesla’s dropped sharply on the news, with ChargePoint Holdings Inc. down 3.9% early Friday and EVgo Inc. sliding 3.5%.--With assistance from Esha Dey and Kurt Schussler.(Updates share moves in third and last paragraphs)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekMicrosoft’s Sudden AI Dominance Is Scrambling Silicon Valley’s Power StructureIs AT&amp;T’s RTO Mandate a Mass Layoff in Disguise?A Saudi Airline Embraces Luxury to End Emirates and Qatar’s Gulf DominanceLayoffs and AI Are Changing Tech’s Once-Invincible Job MarketHow Nvidia Became ChatGPT’s Brain and Joined the $1 Trillion Club©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

A blanket of toxic air engulfing Northeast states likely to last until next week, as the impact of Canadian wildfires heads south. Washington DC is currently under a very unhealthy air quality alert. President Joe Biden saying the US will respond promptly to any Canadian request for more firefighters and air tankers.New York City airports, including LaGuardia and Newark, are facing ground delays for a second day because of low visibility. And the delays could create a ripple effect on US flights as much air traffic flows through New York and the Northeast.SEANA SMITH: GameStop shares plunging after the former meme stock Darling fired CEO Matt Furlong and elevated Ryan Cohen to executive chairman.

Tesla's domination now growing. General Motors is following in the footsteps of rival, Ford Motor, and partnering with Tesla to use the company's charging network, gaining access to 12,000 chargers starting next year. Like Ford, General Motors will also begin installing a charging port used by Tesla known as NACS. This is set to start in 2025. And this really does, Seana, in many ways put everything, the infrastructure, particularly the chargers, in the hands of Tesla.SEANA SMITH: It certainly does, giving them a huge advantage there. We're seeing the reaction. Tesla shares after-hours, GM stock up was up just about 4%, I believe, it still is right now in extended trading. But you're right, it certainly does endorse Tesla's technology as the standard here, industry standard, going forward when it comes to those charging stations.Range anxiety is a real thing when it comes to the EV owners. People are thinking about going out and buying an electric vehicle. I know from your experience, like you shared, Tesla's supercharging network is reliable, especially when you compare it to some of the alternatives out there in terms of some of their competitors with the other model there. So the fact that these drivers, EV drivers are going to have access to even more stations, they will need to use an adapter before the new models are built in 2025.But that should you would think maybe help more people feel comfortable making that transition to an EV and not so concerned that they won't be able to find a charging station.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. And worth noting that the current industry standard is not Tesla's charger, it is what's called CCS. And if both of these companies are going to start installing those chargers into their cars in 2025, you have to wonder what the overall infrastructure is going to look like and whether, in fact, it is going to shift overall in the favor of Tesla, because, as much as GM Ford, so many of these companies, have tried to get the ball rolling here-- and GM is one of those companies that's really built out, whether it's the batteries or the infrastructure, really making a play for the full stack-- they just can't move quickly enough.Story continuesWith the reality right now is they're trying to sell those cars. The charging infrastructure just isn't in place.SEANA SMITH: Yeah. Certainly. A huge advantage. Will be interesting to see if any of others follow. But GM and Ford, great starting point there for Tesla.AKIKO FUJITA: Yeah. That's certainly a stock move on both ends there.]"

McCormick Sr., the Unsung Heroes program, which recognizes unselfish student-athletes, is reflective of McCormick &amp; Company's core belief in the Power of People. To date, the Company has awarded over $2 million in scholarships to deserving student-athletes.This year, McCormick partnered with the Baltimore Banner and the Baltimore Ravens in a celebration of student-athletes in an event held at M&amp;T Bank Stadium in Baltimore. During this inaugural event, students were treated to a behind-the-scenes experience that included locker room tours and visits from the Ravens cheerleaders, Poe, and the OLD BAY can mascot. Students also had a chance to take pictures with keynote speaker Sam Koch, former Punter for the Baltimore Ravens, who addressed the student-athletes later in the evening.Ms. Benckini and Mr. Herbert were chosen from nearly 100 Baltimore-area student-athletes honored as Unsung Heroes this year. The full list of this year's McCormick Unsung Heroes nominees can be found here. McCormick is proud to recognize each of these student athletes.Ms. Benckini, a member of the women's basketball team at Notre Dame Preparatory School, showcased her selflessness on the basketball court. She learned a new position during her senior year to benefit the team, often guarding players who were much taller and battling on key possessions to rebound the ball for her team's chance to score. After suffering a concussion mid-season, she returned at the end of the season to become the biggest supporter for the player who replaced her in the line-up. She is a true Unsung Hero who exemplifies unselfish play.Story continuesMr. Herbert, a member of the men's football team at Perry Hall High School, made sacrifices on and off the field. Despite missing several football practices to work a part-time job and take care of his ailing grandmother, Mr. Herbert was committed to being part of the team and worked hard to become one of the best offensive tackles. He often asked what he could do to continue to improve his skills. In his own words, ""my team provided support through some tough times I faced, and in exchange, I showed up every day ready to put in work so that I could support them and not disappoint them."" He is the definition of an Unsung Hero.Four other students were recognized with additional scholarships at this year's Unsung Heroes event. Brianna Bridgemohan of Forest Park High School and Adam Ossakow of Hereford High School each received $7,500 scholarships. Imani Groce of Western School of Technology and Environmental Science and Emmanuel Awogbesan of Milford Mill Academy each received $5,000 scholarships.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this airline have returned +8.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Transportation - Airline industry, which United falls in, has gained 12.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.United is expected to post earnings of $3.68 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +157.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.97 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +256%. This estimate has changed -0.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $10.26 indicates a change of +14.4% from what United is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, United is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For United, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.94 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $52.96 billion and $55.91 billion estimates indicate +17.8% and +5.6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnited reported revenues of $11.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +51.1%. EPS of -$0.63 for the same period compares with -$4.24 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.07%. The EPS surprise was +13.7%.Over the last four quarters, United surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.United is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about United. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Historically, these are bread-and-butter sellers for Target — and key profit-margin enhancers.Alleged organized crime at Target stores is also weighing on results, execs have said.And to add insult to injury, JPMorgan cut its rating on Target's stock on June 1 on a potential sales hit from the restart of student loan repayments in September.Story continues""Target over-indexes to the millennial customer and, should student loan payments come back on, the company is more exposed than others in our coverage,"" JP Morgan analyst Chris Horvers said. ""Buy-side client expectations are in the $6-8 million per month consumer outflow range should this happen, per our conversations, which represents a potential 1-2 point [comparable] headwind to retail spending.""Horvers is now at a Neutral rating on Target, similar to Citi's Lejuez.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

(ISRG) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-intuitive-surgical-inc-130007655.html,1686229207.0,STORY,['ISRG'],"[Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (ISRG) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +1.5%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Instruments industry, which Intuitive Surgical, Inc. falls in, has lost 2.5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $1.32 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +15.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.47 points to a change of +16.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.35 indicates a change of +16.2% from what Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Intuitive Surgical, Inc. the consensus sales estimate of $1.73 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.8%. The $7.11 billion and $8.06 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +14.3% and +13.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIntuitive Surgical, Inc. reported revenues of $1.7 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +14%. EPS of $1.23 for the same period compares with $1.13 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.59 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.88%. The EPS surprise was +3.36%.Over the last four quarters, Intuitive Surgical, Inc. surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Intuitive Surgical, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

(V) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/visa-inc-v-trending-stock-130011616.html,1686229211,STORY,['V'],"[Visa (V) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this global payments processor have returned -2.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.4% change. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry, to which Visa belongs, has lost 0.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Visa is expected to post earnings of $2.10 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.59 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +14.5%. This estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.68 indicates a change of +12.8% from what Visa is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Visa.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for V _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Visa, the consensus sales estimate of $8.05 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.7%. The $32.52 billion and $36.03 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11% and +10.8%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryVisa reported revenues of $7.99 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.1%. EPS of $2.09 for the same period compares with $1.79 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.75 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +3.01%. The EPS surprise was +6.09%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Visa is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Visa. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MAR, BorgWarner Inc. BWA, Atkore Inc. ATKR, Upbound Group, Inc. UPBD and Triton International Limited TRTN.5 Stocks With High ROE to Buy as Markets Appear on Cruise ModeThe U.S. equity markets appear to have steadied after President Joe Biden signed the debt ceiling bill to avert a potential default on the federal government’s debt. A default would have made the government incapable of borrowing any more money or repaying its bills, endangering the global economy and affecting prices and mortgage rates in other countries. The markets were further propelled by a better-than-expected May jobs report that allayed the fears of recession from the near-term horizon to at least until 2024.The jobs report revealed that payrolls in the public and private sectors increased by 339,000 in May, significantly higher than broad-based expectations of 190,000 rise. While professional and business services added 64,000 jobs, government and healthcare sectors contributed 56,000 and 52,000 job additions, respectively. Average hourly earnings, a key inflation indicator, improved 0.3% for the month and were in sync with expectations. The focus has now shifted to the Federal Reserve’s Jun 13-14 policy meeting, which is likely to be another potential market catalyst.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Marriott International, Inc., BorgWarner Inc., Atkore Inc., Upbound Group, Inc. and Triton International Limited are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.Story continuesROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Here are five of the 10 stocks that qualified the screen:Marriott: Headquartered in Bethesda, MD, Marriott is a leading worldwide hospitality company focused on lodging management and franchising.

225,997eeff4-5200-30b3-9c41-b9f721d13375,VZ,2023-06-09,The past three years for Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) investors has not been profitable,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/past-three-years-verizon-communications-120207759.html,1686312127,STORY,['VZ'],"[For many investors, the main point of stock picking is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) shareholders, since the share price is down 37% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 45%. The more recent news is of little comfort, with the share price down 30% in a year.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. View our latest analysis for Verizon Communications To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Although the share price is down over three years, Verizon Communications actually managed to grow EPS by 4.9% per year in that time. This is quite a puzzle, and suggests there might be something temporarily buoying the share price. Or else the company was over-hyped in the past, and so its growth has disappointed.After considering the numbers, we'd posit that the the market had higher expectations of EPS growth, three years back. However, taking a look at other business metrics might shed a bit more light on the share price action.Given the healthiness of the dividend payments, we doubt that they've concerned the market. Revenue has been pretty flat over three years, so that isn't an obvious reason shareholders would sell. So it might be worth looking at how revenue growth over time, in greater detail.You can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthVerizon Communications is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. Given we have quite a good number of analyst forecasts, it might be well worth checking out this free chart depicting consensus estimates.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Verizon Communications the TSR over the last 3 years was -27%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!A Different PerspectiveInvestors in Verizon Communications had a tough year, with a total loss of 26% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 6.9%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 1.2% over the last half decade. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Verizon Communications better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that  Verizon Communications is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

These upgrades are part of a multi-year redesign of its network architecture to stay ahead of exponential data usage increases, upgrade the technology in the network, and to pave the way for personalized customer experiences. Network upgrades in Detroit include deploying new cell sites to extend coverage and capacity in local communities. They also include adding more capacity on fiber optic cables to move more data through the network and adding bandwidth to the cellular network to accommodate new services like wireless internet service for homes and businesses. Specifics on the upgrades include:Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using Millimeter Wave (mmWave), its premium, high-band spectrum which allows for extremely fast speeds and massive capacity as well as C-band spectrum designed for fast speeds, high capacity and wide coverage. With the recent deployments and upgrades, 91% of people in Detroit now have access to 5G service from Verizon. Verizon Engineers have deployed 5G Ultra Wideband service using its C-band spectrum designed for high capacity and wide coverage. Most notably, Verizon’s 5G Ultra Wideband service is now available via two new cell sites near the Milford Proving Grounds and a third new cell site in the eastern Commerce Township. Engineers have also recently deployed a handful of small cells to increase capacity in the northern suburbs around the Holly and Bald Mountain State Recreation Areas. Comerica Park is also benefiting from 5G service from Verizon with a new indoor system installed in 2023 for visitors and attendees of events in that venue.Detroit’s exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon’s recently acquired C-band spectrum.  Verizon engineers are using 60 MHz of C-band spectrum to deliver 5G service to customers. By the end of the year, customers in Detroit will be able to take advantage of nearly three times that amount of spectrum as it becomes available for 5G Ultra Wideband.  That additional bandwidth will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.Lastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Detroit. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links.  Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network.  Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Detroit area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data. Story continues“We know customers count on us, and we work every day to ensure we deliver for them. Our reliable, secure network connects families, friends, homes and businesses in Detroit, MI with best-in-class 5G Ultra Wideband technology,” said Dean Brauer, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon. “We’re committed to continuing to provide unmatched connectivity to all of our customers across Detroit.”With these and other technology advancements on Verizon’s network, customers are able to use more data in more ways. This multi-service network powers:Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices that do very little networking and stay in place,smartphones with countless opportunities to use data in a highly mobile environment,home and business internet which provides connectivity via the wireless network for homes, offices and retail environments, andcomplex solutions like Augmented Reality or enterprise real-time video and data analysis that require massive computing capabilities.As 5G technology advances and is even more widely adopted by consumers the variety of solutions that will use Verizon’s network will continue to evolve as well.Detroit, MI customers have the best experience on Verizon’s networkThe recent network upgrades have led to customers having the best experience on the Verizon network in Detroit, MI, according to the nation’s most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics®.

The talks have been ongoing for six to eight weeks, with Amazon keen to secure the lowest possible wholesale prices, the Bloomberg report said.Verizon and T-Mobile, as well as AT&amp;T, denied any negotiations were underway, Reuters said, while Dish did not provide a comment to the news agency.In a note, the CFRA analysts said that the e-commerce giant is currently focused on boosting its retail margins, particularly as growth at its key cloud-computing division Amazon Web Services shows signs of flagging.Amazon may subsequently be dissuaded from spending heavily on subsidizing wireless phone plans for Prime members at the current moment, they added.Meanwhile, the deal could see wireless carriers lose direct access to customers, which may outweigh the amount of indirect consumers they gain from Amazon, the analysts said.Related ArticlesAmazon unlikely to launch wireless service for Prime users soon - CFRA ResearchCarvana forecasts second-quarter core profit above $50 millionJefferies downgrades Las Vegas Sands and Wynn as Macau recovery is priced in]"

You can skip our detailed discussion on the healthcare sector and its performance, and go directly to read 5 Healthcare Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. The healthcare sector in the US is a multifaceted industry that plays a crucial role in providing medical services to the population. The sector overall includes healthcare providers, health insurers, MedTech companies, pharmaceuticals, and research and development companies. The healthcare sector demonstrated resilience over the years mainly because of its defensive nature. The stable demand for medical products and services also contributes to the sector’s performance during recessionary periods. BlackRock reported that the healthcare industry outperformed the broader market over the last seven recessionary periods by an average of 10.3%.Last year’s financial turmoil altered the investment landscape as investors struggled to balance their portfolios due to persistent interest rate hikes and growing inflation. The healthcare sector emerged as one of the winners in 2022, with the S&amp;P 500 Healthcare Index falling by just 2.44%, compared with an 18.5% decline in the S&amp;P 500.Also read: 15 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy NowApart from their defensive nature, another reason for the outperformance of the healthcare sector is its adaptability to address the challenges and changes brought about by the pandemic of 2020. The rapid expansion of telehealth gave way to improved healthcare services, particularly for individuals in rural or underserved areas. In 2022, 68% of physicians offered virtual health options, up from 14% in the prior year, according to Deloitte’s data we reported in 14 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks to Buy.

In the first quarter of 2023, the company reported revenue of $26.7 billion, up 11.6% from the same period last year. The company's operating cash flow for the quarter came in at over $6.6 billion, compared with $308 million in the prior-year period. It is among the healthcare stocks billionaires are loading up on alongside Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS).In May, TD Cowen raised its price target on Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) to $616 with an Outperform rating on the shares, highlighting the company's business stability.Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) is also a dividend stock and has raised its payouts for 6 years in a row. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.885 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.69%, as of June 7.At the end of Q1 2023, 68 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), up from 67 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $3.78 billion. Billionaire Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q1.14. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Billionaire Investors: 15 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational healthcare and medical devices company. In May, Morgan Stanley assumed its coverage on the stock with an Equal Weight rating and a $112 price target. The firm mentioned that the stock's valuation is now looking fair.In the first quarter of 2023, the company posted revenue of $9.7 billion and reported a 10% year-over-year growth in its organic sales on an underlying basis. The company is also a Dividend King with 51 years of consecutive dividend growth. It pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share for a dividend yield of 1.99%, as recorded on June 7.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the most popular healthcare stocks among billionaires. Ray Dalio, Cliff Asness, and Ken Griffin were some of the most popular billionaire investors having stakes in the company.Overall, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) was a part of 70 hedge fund portfolios in Q1 2023, up from 60 in the previous quarter. The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $2.37 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“As stated below in the portfolio activity section, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is expected to see roughly $6 billion in COVID test sales evaporate this year, creating a headwind for margins and underlying earnings per share. As long-term owners of the business, these test sales were never part of our original investment case. The core business, our primary focus, has a clear path of growing high single digits in 2023 with durable growth beyond, in our view. We believe the current price of 23x NTM P/E , while reasonable, is also misleading considering earnings this year will be artificially depressed because of the drop in COVID testing sales. On normalized earnings, the price is lower. We anticipate underlying EPS growth of at least low-teens over the next three to five years.Lastly, we trimmed Abbott Laboratories, bringing it back to a more average position size and to also fund our increase in Thermo Fisher. Abbott is entering a year in which the company is expected to see approximately $6bn in COVID-19 test sales disappear, thus, creating a headwind for margins and EPS. That said, the core business has a clear path to growing high single digits in FY23. EPS grew at a 20% CAGR from 2019-2022, far beyond our expectations when we initiated our investment. Now, we expect a more normal growth rate of low teens EPS beyond this year. Further, management’s adeptness at allocating capital continues to impress us. We expect Abbott to drive top line growth without heavily investing in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A this year— management effectively “front-loaded” those investments in 2021 and 2022 when COVID test sales created a bolus of cash. We believe this should allow for leverage on the operating margin going forward. Combined, Abbott and Thermo Fisher now represent 7% of the Portfolio.”13. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK)Number of Billionaire Investors: 15 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is a Texas-based company that distributes pharmaceuticals and provides other care management tools.

These stakes have a consolidated value of roughly $4 billion.Here is what Broyhill Asset Management has to say about McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) gained 50% for the twelve months ending December 2022, as opioid-related litigation concerns, which weighed on the stock for years, took a back seat to strong operating performance. When we first established the position in 2018, we explained that, “Although headlines remind us daily of growing threats to the business, the actual probability of this business dramatically changing in the next five years is much lower than the perceived probability. We are simply betting that the future might not be as bad as the price suggests.”Consensus FY22 and FY23 EPS estimates at the time were around $17 – $18 per share. The company reported ~ $24 in earnings in FY22, and is on pace for $26 in FY23, even as consensus estimates for the broader market were repeatedly revised lower.

(NASDAQ:DXCM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We started a position in DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), a medical device company that sells continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices for people with diabetes. DexCom is in the early stages of the launch of its seventh-generation device called the G7, which offers many new features, including 60% smaller size, a disposable transmitter, and 30-minute sensor warmup, among other features. We think the G7 will drive revenue growth acceleration through continued penetration in the core insulin-intensive diabetes population globally. In addition, Medicare recently decided to provide coverage of CGM for people with Type 2 diabetes who are basal insulin users, meaning people with diabetes who use insulin daily but don’t need to use insulin intensively at every meal or multiple times daily. This expanded coverage adds millions of people to DexCom’s addressable market. Over the long term, we believe DexCom will have an opportunity to expand into the even larger category of non-insulin users with Type 2 diabetes given the benefits of CGM in helping all people manage their diabetes.”10.

The company offered exposure to therapeutics in obesity and diabetes via the launch of Mounjaro, as well as in Alzheimer’s via Donanemab which was filed in November 2022 for accelerated Phase 3 approval in mid-2023.

That is because the Dec 15, 2023 $75 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Genuine Parts shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Genuine Parts is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in the Automotive - Replacement Parts industry that ranks in the Bottom 30% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, no analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while six analysts have revised their estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.38 per share to $2.30 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Genuine Parts right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing.

The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s examine Cummins’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Cummins What's The Opportunity In Cummins?According to my valuation model, Cummins seems to be fairly priced at around 5.73% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Cummins today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $214.59, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Cummins’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What kind of growth will Cummins generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 11% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Cummins. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? CMI’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on CMI, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

(Photo: Arrow Truck Sales)After 32 years in Texas, Arrow Truck Sales announced it is closing its three branches across the Lone Star State.The closures are related to a state law prohibiting motor vehicle manufacturers from also owning auto dealerships and selling vehicles directly to consumers. Arrow Truck Sales is a subsidiary of automaker Volvo.“The closure of these Arrow branches in Texas comes as a significant disappointment to Arrow, our employees, and our business partners and is an unfortunate loss to the overall trucking industry in Texas,” Arrow Truck Sales said in a statement.“This closure is driven by Texas state regulations, which prohibit motor vehicle manufacturers from operating as a motor vehicle selling dealership. Arrow, a subsidiary of the Volvo Group, is classified in the state as a manufacturer, and thus is affected by this regulation.”Arrow Truck Sales did not return a request for comment from FreightWaves.Arrow locations in Dallas, Houston and San Antonio will close permanently on July 31.The company said no other Arrow locations will be affected and it will continue to support Texas customers in after-sales situations through its corporate customer service department, along with honoring warranties and third-party vehicle service contracts.Arrow Truck Sales, which was founded in 1950, is based in Kansas City, Missouri. The company sells used heavy- and medium-duty trucks and trailers across 16 locations in the U.S. and Canada. Volvo Trucks North America Inc. acquired Arrow Truck Sales in 2001.Arrow began operating in Texas in 1991, when it opened a branch in Dallas.The Texas law banning auto manufacturers from selling directly to consumers went into effect in 2003. Arrow secured an exemption in 2007 that allowed the company to continue dealership operations through Aug. 31, 2023.Texas’ auto dealership regulations have been criticized by automakers such as Tesla and Lucid Motors, as well as engine maker Cummins Inc. and business tycoon Warren Buffett.Story continuesCummins has been cited by Texas agencies for violating the state’s dealership rules because it not only makes engines for trucks, buses and other heavy vehicles, but it also performs warranty service on them, which is against the regulations.Cummins has advocated for legislation that would have eased restrictions against the company in the state, but the measure failed to pass the Texas legislature in 2019.Texas lawmakers did pass a bill in 2019 providing a loophole for Buffett’s holding company — Berkshire Hathaway — to continue owning its more than two dozen Texas auto dealerships while also owning Forest River, an Indiana manufacturer of recreational vehicles that it sells across the state.In November, Lucid filed a federal lawsuit in Texas alleging that the state’s regulation on dealerships is “economic protectionism” for auto dealers.“As applied to Lucid, this prohibition is irrational in the extreme: it hurts competition, reduces consumer choice, and drives up costs and inconvenience, with no countervailing benefit whatsoever,” according to the lawsuit. “This prohibition is pure economic protectionism for the benefit of Texas’s existing auto dealers. It puts their profits ahead of the interests of Texas consumers.”Watch: Are the labor negotiations hurting business for west coast ports?Click for more FreightWaves articles by Noi Mahoney.More articles by Noi MahoneyIs Canada losing out to US and Mexico in nearshoring boom?Mexico offers incentives to lure investors to Tehuantepec projectCanadian Pacific Kansas City expands Mexico intermodal reefer serviceThe post National truck dealership exiting Texas, blames state regulations appeared first on FreightWaves.]"

Disney once offered cricket on its platform for free, but has required users to subscribe to a paid plan since 2020.Disney earlier had digital rights for the Indian Premier League (IPL), one of the world's most lucrative annual sporting properties. But JioCinema, run by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani's Viacom18, spent $2.9 billion to bag those rights and then rolled it out for free on the streaming platform.The free offering will reach more than 540 million smartphone users, Disney said on Friday, adding it was aimed at making the matches ""accessible to as many mobile users in India"".The cricket matches, however, will continue to be paid when accessed on TV or via website.The strategy shift from Disney comes as rivalry with JioCinema heats up. Ahead of the IPL matches that concluded in May, Disney used ads to promote viewing of the games on TVs, for which it had rights, while JioCinema countered with ads to lure users to its free web streaming and mobile offering.While JioCinema has started charging users for premium content, including for the recent Hollywood content deal it struck with Warner Bros and NBCUniversal, its executives have said IPL streaming will continue to be offered at no cost.The viewership battle is raging as cricket is the most popular game in the world's top populous nation, where the bulk of digital consumption is driven by smartphones with an estimated 700 million users.Story continuesResearch firm CLSA has estimated Disney Hotstar's subscriber base shrank by nearly 5 million users in India after it lost the digital rights for IPL.Elara Capital analyst Karan Taurani labeled Disney's move as a ""desperate"" attempt to garner lost users, but warned free cricket - be it by JioCinema or Disney - sends a negative signal for the industry.""If continued over the longer term, free cricket offerings may magnify losses for streaming platforms or lead to consolidation, as many platforms may not be able to survive with lower revenue per user,"" he said.India's streaming industry has been growing rapidly, with Netflix and Amazon Prime among the key players.Media Partners Asia says Disney+ Hotstar leads the market as of March end despite the slump in subscribers due to the loss of IPL rights, accounting for more than 40% of the total user base in India.

The bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8 cents.RevenuesDuring the quarter, Akamai registered revenues of $915.7 million, up from $903.6 million reported in the prior-year quarter.

Compute revenues increased 49 % year over year to $115.8 million from $77.9 million in the prior-year quarter, owing to the growing demand for various cloud computing services.

Wade, activist investors are pushing companies to disclose the impact new abortion rights laws could have their businesses. Yahoo Finance legal reporter Alexis Kennan breaks down what investors want to know.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, the constitutional right to abortion was revoked last year when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade. Now as we follow up on, this activist investors are pushing major companies to disclose the impact the new limitations have on their businesses. Joining us now is Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan to break it all down for us. Hey, Alexis.ALEXIS KEENAN: Hi, Rachelle. So yeah, the number of shareholder proposals that relate to abortion access, they doubled from last year's proxy season to this year's. And the number this year reached about 30. And the big takeaway here is that all of the proposals and Yahoo Finance's counted about 16 of them, all of them that went to a vote, they said no to the idea of requiring that companies explain the financial as well as reputational risks that they face now that women have no constitutional right to abortion.Now take a look at some of the companies that face these types of votes. They go across industries. Meta, Google, Costco, Home Depot, Coca-Cola, Pfizer, Walmart and Comcast as well. Comcast just had its vote yesterday. Preliminary results show also a no there to these issues.Now let's talk specifically about what these measures entail. By and large, these proposals, they sought disclosures from these companies on matters like how companies handle abortion-related customer data in response to law enforcement or potential law enforcement requests, also how their political contributions to candidates conflict with their company's stated values, also how state abortion limitations can impact hiring as well as retaining and relocating workers, and also on the other side of the issue, the potential risks of even supporting abortion.Story continuesSo altogether, Yahoo Finance reviewed about these 30 proposals that were on the table this year. Some of them though were withdrawn before a vote. And in some cases, those withdrawals can be seen as a success by their proponents because they forced companies to make some changes. And one of those is CVS. They faced a proposal, but before it went to a vote, the company agreed to provide some greater protections around their customers' health care data.But certainly this is part of a wider ESG push. But we're seeing on both sides of the political and ideological aisles here, these issues coming to a fore. But just a huge uptick this year in the number of abortion related matters on the table that doubling from last year. Just a significant, significant change despite the fact that these were virtually all no-votes so far. Rachelle?RACHELLE AKUFFO: Certainly a lot of people seeking some clarity here, at least not getting it for now. A big thank you, Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. Thanks so much.]"

(PRU) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prudential-financial-inc-pru-trending-130006775.html,1686229206,STORY,['PRU'],"[Prudential (PRU) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this financial services company have returned +6.7%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, which Prudential falls in, has gained 2.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Prudential is expected to post earnings of $3.15 per share, indicating a change of +81% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +3.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $11.94 points to a change of +26.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.5%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.80 indicates a change of +7.2% from what Prudential is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Prudential.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Prudential, the consensus sales estimate of $12.51 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -9.2%. The $53.67 billion and $53.51 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -13% and -0.3%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPrudential reported revenues of $15.1 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +10.6%. EPS of $2.66 for the same period compares with $3.17 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.29 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.65%. The EPS surprise was -11.92%.The company could not beat consensus EPS estimates in any of the last four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Prudential is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Prudential. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

265,86fa9b7b-99f5-3b58-9478-8d4b12fc021f,DVN,2023-06-09,There's A Lot To Like About Devon Energy's (NYSE:DVN) Upcoming US$0.72 Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/theres-lot-devon-energys-nyse-103703710.html,1686307023,STORY,['DVN'],"[Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is about to trade ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Devon Energy's shares before the 14th of June to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 30th of June.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.72 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$4.55 to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Devon Energy has a trailing yield of 9.1% on the current stock price of $50.02. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. So we need to check whether the dividend payments are covered, and if earnings are growing. See our latest analysis for Devon Energy Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Devon Energy is paying out an acceptable 55% of its profit, a common payout level among most companies. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Devon Energy generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. It paid out 17% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservatively low.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.historic-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That's why it's comforting to see Devon Energy's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 47% per annum for the past five years. Management appears to be striking a nice balance between reinvesting for growth and paying dividends to shareholders. Earnings per share have been growing quickly and in combination with some reinvestment and a middling payout ratio, the stock may have decent dividend prospects going forwards.Story continuesThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. In the last 10 years, Devon Energy has lifted its dividend by approximately 19% a year on average. Both per-share earnings and dividends have both been growing rapidly in recent times, which is great to see.Final TakeawayIs Devon Energy an attractive dividend stock, or better left on the shelf? Devon Energy's growing earnings per share and conservative payout ratios make for a decent combination. We also like that it paid out a lower percentage of its cash flow. Overall we think this is an attractive combination and worthy of further research.On that note, you'll want to research what risks Devon Energy is facing.

The stock lagged the S&amp;P 500's daily gain of 0.62%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.5%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, lost 5.66%.Coming into today, shares of the equipment rental company had gained 15.32% in the past month. In that same time, the Construction sector gained 5.29%, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 3.44%.Investors will be hoping for strength from United Rentals as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $9.20, up 17.05% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $3.43 billion, up 23.96% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $39.70 per share and revenue of $14.15 billion. These totals would mark changes of +22.15% and +21.55%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for United Rentals. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 0.65% lower. United Rentals is currently a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Investors should also note United Rentals's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 9.76. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 16.66, so we one might conclude that United Rentals is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesInvestors should also note that URI has a PEG ratio of 0.6 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Building Products - Miscellaneous was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.66 at yesterday's closing price.The Building Products - Miscellaneous industry is part of the Construction sector.

This compares to earnings of $0.13 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 33.33%.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $34.65 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates just once over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.American Software shares have lost about 8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 11.2%.What's Next for American Software?While American Software has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for American Software: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $13.74 billion, indicating an increase of 16.04% on a year-over-year basis.Oracle expects non-GAAP earnings per share growth rate on a year-over-year basis in the range of 3-5% at cc and $1.56-$1.60 per share in USD.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings has remained steady at $1.58 per share in the past 30 days, suggesting a 2.6% increase from the year-ago fiscal quarter’s reported figure.Over the trailing four quarters, Oracle’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on three occasions and missed the mark once with the average surprise being 3.24%.Oracle Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseOracle Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseOracle Corporation price-eps-surprise | Oracle Corporation QuoteFactors to ConsiderAccelerated digital transformation, along with the continuation of remote work and mainstream adoption of the hybrid/flexible work model, is likely to have driven demand for Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) services and the company’s other cloud-based applications in the to-be-reported quarter.The acquisition of Cerner in 2022, in an all-cash transaction amounting to $28.3 billion or $95 per share, is expected to have bolstered the company’s position in the lucrative healthcare domain. In the third quarter of fiscal 2023, Cerner contributed $1.5 billion to the total revenues driven by continued strength in the Fusion, Autonomous Database and OCI services.For the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, total cloud, including Cerner, is expected to grow from 51% to 53% at cc and from 49% to 51% in USD.Continued momentum in back-office cloud-based Fusion Human Capital Management solutions, along with NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) and Fusion ERP applications, is expected to have favored ORCL’s quarterly performance.On May 18, Oracle announced that it is joining the Scheduling Standards Consortium to improve logistics efficiency. The migration of several large-scale SAP clients to Oracle Fusion ERP cloud and increasing deal wins in several verticals, especially banking and healthcare, might have acted as tailwinds for the company’s ERP business.The robust adoption of Oracle’s next-generation Autonomous Database and Oracle Dedicated Region Cloud, supported by machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, might have benefited the top line. Autonomous Database in Gen2 public cloud infrastructure is witnessing healthy traction.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Oracle this time. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

WealthWise Financial CEO Loreen Gilbert details which major tech stocks remain independently strong, while benefiting from AI trends.Video TranscriptAKIKO FUJITA: Well, how big can the bubble get before it bursts? AI is the biggest trend on Wall Street right now and the hype is real. An AI fueled rally sent Nvidia shares up more than 150% so far this year. And the chipmaker is not the only company capitalizing on the trend.Palantir shares surged toward a 17 month high after launching an AI powered data integration offering for manufacturers. And the rally is not showing any signs of stopping. But our next guest says, buyers beware, blaming the AI hype for driving stock prices to unreasonable levels. Let's bring in Loreen Gilbert, WealthWise Financial CEO, to make her case.Loreen, your note's got a lot of us talking because we've heard over and over Nvidia is the big AI play. You've got that's on your list of not great buys right now.LOREEN GILBERT: Well, and it's all about when you buy a stock and how you buy a stock. But if you look at the forward PE of Nvidia right now trading at over 200 times, that seems like an unreasonable valuation. And so there has to be a reason for it.There has to be something that would sustain that kind of valuation. And that would mean that we'd have to see some catalyst for a huge surge in sales or some efficiencies in profit margins. And we don't see the same story like we did with Tesla, which was able to accomplish both.So we just don't see that vision for the kind of valuation that we're seeing on those kinds of stocks. But it seems as though the money that was invested in crypto has now all gone to AI. And so when I say buyer beware, there will be winners with AI. We just don't know who those winners are going to be yet.SEANA SMITH: Loreen, how do you go about trying to gauge who those winners will be down the line? Because I think so many investors are trying to figure out the next big thing. Yes, there is hype surrounding AI. So if it's not smart to buy Nvidia, it's not smart to get into Palantir, I guess what are you using as that base model in order to figure out who could potentially benefit?Story continuesLOREEN GILBERT: We're looking at the companies that we think could replace Nvidia. So, for instance, Microsoft, Google, those companies that could do it themselves and not rely upon another company for their architecture, and they could create it themselves. So we think that that has a lot more of a reasonable outlook, and as far as valuations, much more reasonable valuations as well.AKIKO FUJITA: You're talking about companies that could own the full stack, right? I mean, there's so few, it would seem. And Microsoft is one. Some could point to Apple down the line.You can take a name like a Microsoft that has seen a lot of gains on the back of it, on the back of their success and their partnership with Chat-- with OpenAI. Is this a good time to get in on that name?LOREEN GILBERT: Well, we like it. We hold it. We do hold Microsoft. And we do think having those kinds of names, those are solid companies with solid balance sheets.And they're not going anywhere. And they're going to be at the forefront of AI as well. So that's why I'm saying I think companies like that would be the ones to look for.SEANA SMITH: Loreen, outside of technology, outside of the AI hype, you also point to another stock-- or you do point to a stock that you think is going to benefit here, at least over the summer. You see a catalyst here for Public Storage, a name that we don't talk about too often. Why do you like it?LOREEN GILBERT: Well, storage units are very profitable. So we're looking at a very profitable business model. We're looking at a 4% dividend. That's 75% covered by operations.And when we look at their debt structure, their debt structure is reasonable-- currently at 3.6% of their revenues. And even if it goes up to 5%, still a sustainable amount of debt load there. So we like the business.It's something that people continue to need, storage units. And if you can't go out and buy your own storage unit, looking at one that's publicly traded is another idea.AKIKO FUJITA: Loreen, when you look broadly at the markets right now, I mean, how are you thinking about where the investment should be? We've already talked about the key themes that we have heard over and over-- AI being one of them, tech is one that is becoming increasingly a crowded trade. Are there some big bargains that you think investors are overlooking?LOREEN GILBERT: I do think when you look at opportunities, there's a number of opportunities. I think going down in capitalization is an opportunity, small and mid-cap, looking more on the fixed income side, which is still a great opportunity. And, frankly, we've seen the returns that we expected for the year already year to date. So taking that into account, the reality that we're most likely going into recession would be a time to reconsider asset allocation, look at taking some gains off the table, looking at increasing income as we see that as an opportunity, and ride out the rest of the year.AKIKO FUJITA: Loreen Gilbert, WealthWise Financial CEO, some good tips there. Thank you so much for joining us.]"

This high-capacity memory designed for data center operations is qualified with the Advanced Micro Devices’ AMD 4th Gen EPYC processors.Micron DDR5 RDIMMs avoid costly die stacking needs that add latency and empower artificial intelligence (AI) and in-memory database workloads. The modules can attain a peak memory bandwidth of 378 GB/s per socket with AMD’s 4th Gen EPYC processors, which is higher than the 189 GB/s attained with AMD’s 3rd Gen EPYC processors. Thus, the 96GB DDR5 RDIMMs can offer two times higher bandwidth compared with prior generations of the processor systems.At maturity, DDR5 RDIMM enables speeds of 8800 MT/s, delivering up to a 3x improvement in effective memory bandwidth compared with DDR4, which is required to feed the continued growth of central processing unit cores in the modern data center. The combination of Micron’s DDR5 and AMD 4th Gen EPYC processors transforms data center operations of enterprise customers while accelerating their time to value, reducing their total ownership costs and aiding to address their sustainability targets.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and Consensus Micron Technology, Inc. Price and ConsensusMicron Technology, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteSupermicro 8125GS, an AMD-based platform for high-performance computing, artificial intelligence, deep learning training and industrial server workloads, includes the Micron 96GB DDR5 modules. The system aligns well with Micron’s portfolio of advanced memory to deliver validated, tested and proven solutions for data center deployments and advanced workloads.Micron DDR5 RDIMM stands as a significant enhancement in the system memory capabilities that are required to enable increasingly memory-bound algorithms, which bodes well for the next generation of data center infrastructure.Micron is witnessing growing demand for memory chips from cloud-computing providers and acceleration in 5G cellular network adoptions. Rising mix of high-value solutions, 5G adoption in Internet of Things devices and wireless infrastructure, enhancement in customer engagement and improvement in cost structure are driving the company’s growth.Story continuesLast month, the company released the Micron 6500 ION NVMe solid-state drive (SSD) and the Micron XTR NVMe SSD to reduce operating costs and advance storage efficiency of the data centers. The new roll outs intend to enable huge storage, control costs and improve data center sustainability for the data center operators by reducing power consumption.In second-quarter fiscal 2023, Micron reported revenues of $3.69 billion, which plunged 53% year over year and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.76 billion. Rapidly weakening consumer demand and substantial customer inventory adjustments across end markets amid macroeconomic uncertainty were the main reasons behind the dismal quarterly performance. The consensus mark for the company’s third-quarter fiscal 2023 revenues is pegged at $3.69 billion, suggesting a further 57.3% decline.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderMicron currently has a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), while Advanced Micro Devices carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Through the agreement, Micron will receive approximately 178 megawatts (MW) of wind electricity capacity and associated renewable energy certificates annually. This contract will support Micron’s U.S. target to reach 100% renewable energy by the end of 2025 and marks the latest milestone in Micron’s journey to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.“This partnership with Terra-Gen adds another utility-scale renewable energy project to our growing portfolio, supporting our goal to achieve 100% renewable energy in the U.S. by the end of 2025,” said Manish Bhatia, executive vice president of Global Operations at Micron. “Terra-Gen’s proven track record of building and operating efficient facilities, as well as the maturity of this particular wind project enables Micron to diversify our energy portfolio and to effectively manage our long-term energy costs in the U.S.”Once the project begins generating electricity for Micron, it is forecasted to avoid more than 280,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2e) emissions annually, comparable to the average electricity use of more than 50,000 homes in the United States.1Micron has committed to spending approximately $1 billion by 2028 to support its environmental targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from operations (scope 1) by 42% by 2030, compared against the company’s 2020 baseline, as part of Micron’s aspiration to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions in operations and purchased energy by 2050; achieve 75% water conservation and 95% waste reduction, reuse, and recycling globally in 2030; and source 100% renewable energy across its U.S. operations by the end of 2025.Story continuesMicron takes a multifaceted approach toward meeting its global net zero operational target. This includes investing in advanced abatement systems, prioritizing use of gases with lower global warming potential, sourcing energy-efficient equipment, and purchasing renewable instead of fossil fuel-generated energy.To date, Micron has made significant progress in managing its greenhouse gas emissions through several initiatives in 2022. The company signed its first seven-year green energy purchasing agreement in Taiwan to provide Micron with 500 million kilowatt hours of green energy. Micron achieved 100% renewable energy in Malaysia, and, in Boise, the company partnered with Idaho Power to advance solar-powered energy with the addition of a new 40 MW facility.For more information about Micron’s sustainability, visit www.micron.com/sustainability.About Micron Technology, Inc.We are an industry leader in innovative memory and storage solutions, transforming how the world uses information to enrich life for all.

(NASDAQ:HAS) Improve Its Returns?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hasbro-inc-nasdaq-improve-returns-175250735.html,1686246770,STORY,['HAS'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. View our latest analysis for Hasbro How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Hasbro is:4.3% = US$118m ÷ US$2.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.04 in profit.Does Hasbro Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, Hasbro has a lower ROE than the average (19%) in the Leisure industry classification.roeThat's not what we like to see. However, a low ROE is not always bad. If the company's debt levels are moderate to low, then there's still a chance that returns can be improved via the use of financial leverage. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Hasbro by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesHasbro's Debt And Its 4.3% ROEHasbro does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.42. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Hasbro may not be the best stock to buy.

279,07bd1e69-be33-3315-ae32-dd14eccc6b0d,YUM,2023-06-09,"Is Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) Worth US$132 Based On Its Intrinsic Value?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/yum-brands-inc-nyse-yum-135132149.html,1686232292,STORY,['YUM'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Yum! Brands fair value estimate is US$98.27Yum! Brands is estimated to be 35% overvalued based on current share price of US$132 The US$147 analyst price target for YUM is 50% more than our estimate of fair valueToday we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Yum! Brands, Inc. (NYSE:YUM) by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. View our latest analysis for Yum! Brands The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.48bUS$1.69bUS$1.85bUS$1.98bUS$2.08bUS$2.17bUS$2.25bUS$2.33bUS$2.39bUS$2.46bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Analyst x2Est @ 6.70%Est @ 5.32%Est @ 4.36%Est @ 3.68%Est @ 3.21%Est @ 2.88%Est @ 2.65% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.2% US$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.4kUS$1.3kUS$1.3kUS$1.2kUS$1.2kUS$1.1kUS$1.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$13bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.5b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.2%– 2.1%) = US$36bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$36b÷ ( 1 + 9.2%)10= US$15bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$28b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$132, the company appears potentially overvalued at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Yum! Brands as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.186. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Yum! BrandsStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Hospitality market.Expensive based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value lower than the current share price? For Yum! Brands, we've compiled three additional items you should assess:Risks: Take risks, for example - Yum!

This growth is influenced by factors such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine war. In 2022, the estimated total beef production in the United States reached 28.29 billion pounds, showing a slight increase from the previous year's production of 27.95 billion pounds. Over the past two decades, although there have been minor fluctuations, the overall US beef production has remained stable.

Over the five-year period between 2018 and 2023, the number of businesses in the beef cattle production industry in the US has experienced an average annual decline of 1.1%.

It was 50 large cap stocks that were considered “must own” by professional investors. They were growth stocks and it was believed that you should own them no matter what the price.On average, at the peak of the bull market, many traded with a P/E over 50. But valuation didn’t matter because each company had a strong growth story.These weren’t companies that didn’t have earnings. Some were dominant in their industries, like IBM and General Electric, and were innovating.As long as there was growth, what could go wrong?2 Original Nifty Fifty StocksThere is no actual list of which companies were in the Nifty Fifty. But there are a bunch of companies that most agree were considered on it. Many of those companies are still in business today.1.      McDonald’s Corp. MCDMcDonald’s went IPO on Apr 21, 1965. In the early stages of its growth, it was a popular growth stock in the 1960s and 70s and was considered a part of the Nifty Fifty. But is it still a growth stock today?Story continuesMcDonald’s earnings are expected to rise 9.3% in 2023 while sales are forecast to grow 7.7%. Not too shabby for a mature global company.Shares of McDonald’s recently traded at new all-time highs. They are up 76.2% over the last 5 years compared to the S&amp;P 500’s gain of 53.8%. But shares aren’t cheap. McDonald’s is trading with a forward P/E of 26.Should investors still ignore valuation with McDonald’s and buy at any price?2.      Walmart Inc. WMTWalmart was also a young company in the 1960s and 70s. It went public on Oct 1, 1970.Walmart earnings are expected to fall 1.4% in fiscal 2024, as the economy slows this year. Sales are forecast to rise 4.2%, however.Walmart is a mature company in 2023. Growth has slowed. But the shares are not cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 24.2.Should Walmart be on your short list?3 New Nifty Fifty StocksWhat companies would be on a new Nifty Fifty? These would be growth stocks that investors considered to be “must own” and which valuation didn’t matter.There’s no screen to run to find these stocks. But here are 3 that would surely be in the running for the new list.1.      Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. CMGIs Chipotle the McDonald’s of the new Nifty Fifty? This restaurant chain continues to expand. Earnings are expected to rise 34% in 2023 with sales up 14%.No, Chipotle isn’t cheap.

286,26dd59aa-120a-3951-90d6-bc7f4fcc518e,UPS,2023-06-09,United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) shareholders have earned a 21% CAGR over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-parcel-nyse-ups-shareholders-130021956.html,1686229221,STORY,['UPS'],"[One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But many of us dare to dream of bigger returns, and build a portfolio ourselves. For example, United Parcel Service, Inc. (NYSE:UPS) shareholders have seen the share price rise 61% over three years, well in excess of the market return (30%, not including dividends).With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for United Parcel Service In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).United Parcel Service was able to grow its EPS at 36% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 17% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt is of course excellent to see how United Parcel Service has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. This free interactive report on United Parcel Service's balance sheet strength is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, United Parcel Service's TSR for the last 3 years was 75%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 3.9% in the last year, United Parcel Service shareholders lost 1.0% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 11% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

BLD touched a new 52-week high of $229.44 on Jun 7. The stock pulled back to end the trading session at $228.54, up 1.65% from the previous day’s closing price of $224.83.BLD has gained 46.1% in the year-to-date period compared with the Zacks Building Products – Miscellaneous industry’s growth of 19.8%, the Zacks Construction sector’s increase of 20.1% and S&amp;P 500 Index’s growth of 12.2%.Amid high material and labor costs as well as supply-chain constraints, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has been witnessing high sales volume and selling prices in its Installation as well as Specialty Distribution segments. The upside was backed by operational efficiencies, accretive acquisitions and successful inflation mitigation initiatives.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat's Driving the Outperformance?TopBuild has been recording solid earnings and revenue growth over the last few quarters. In first-quarter 2023, the company’s sales increased 8.2%, adjusted earnings per share grew 24.6%, the adjusted gross margin expanded 180 bps and the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 150 bps from the prior-year period’s levels. The impressive margin expansion led to increased profitability, depicting a flexible operating model and its ability to quickly reduce costs. The impressive performance was backed by higher sales volume and higher selling prices in both segments of the company along with contributions from acquisitions. Also, operational efficiencies, fixed-cost leverage and the ongoing success in managing inflation aided the company.Acquisitions are an important part of the company’s growth strategy to supplement organic growth and expand access to additional markets and products. On Jan 26, 2023, BLD completed this year’s first acquisition by acquiring SRI Holdings, which is a residential insulation installation company.In 2022, BLD made five insulation company acquisitions, which are expected to generate $17.3 million in revenues annually, including CV Insulation, LLC., Assured Insulating, which serves markets in North-eastern Texas and North-western Louisiana, Green Energy (located in Orego), Billings (located in Montana), Southwest (located in Florida). The increase in net sales of BLD in first-quarter 2023 was partially driven by these acquisitions, which contributed 1.3% to sales growth. The company is focused on driving top-line growth, the successful integration of DI and improving operational efficiencies. Meanwhile, the company remains committed to its long-term outlook.BLD maintains a strong liquidity position. Cash and cash equivalents at first-quarter 2023-end were $333.8 million, up from $240.1 million at 2022-end. The company has $432.3 million available in borrowing capacity under the revolving facility. This brings the total liquidity to $766.1 million at first-quarter 2023-end up from $672.4 million reported at 2022-end.Story continuesKey PicksHere are some top-ranked stocks that investors may consider from the same sector.Dycom Industries, Inc.

Horton’s strong cash position and low debt/capital ratio allowed it to make strategic land purchases even during the downturn, in turn, giving it a significant competitive advantage. The company has selectively invested in attractively-priced land and lots in the past few years allowing it to bring new attractive communities in desirable markets. For the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, the company invested $900 million and $980 million in finished lots, $690 million and $590 million in land development, and $130 million and $150 million in acquiring land, respectively.Profit From Entry-Level Homes: D.R. Horton’s strategic shift toward more entry-level affordable homes has been paying off, with the segment experiencing strong demand and limited supply. First-time homebuyers represented 55% of its closings in second-quarter fiscal 2023.High-Return Strategies: DHI strategically manages pricing, incentives and sales pace across its markets in a manner that will optimize the returns on inventory investments. It believes a consistent sales pace through inventory turnover is the best way to maximize profits and returns. With 547,000 lots (25% were owned and 75% controlled through purchase contracts) in inventory at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2023, D.R.

(NYSE:ZBH)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportune-moment-examine-zimmer-144140331.html,1686235300,STORY,['ZBH'],"[Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:ZBH) received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$143 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$122. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Zimmer Biomet Holdings' current trading price of US$133 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Zimmer Biomet Holdings’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for Zimmer Biomet Holdings What's The Opportunity In Zimmer Biomet Holdings?According to my valuation model, Zimmer Biomet Holdings seems to be fairly priced at around 3.08% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Zimmer Biomet Holdings today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $129.10, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Zimmer Biomet Holdings’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Zimmer Biomet Holdings?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Zimmer Biomet Holdings' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? ZBH’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on ZBH, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

The study analyzed 1,472 people, exactly half adherent on PAP, half non-adherent.The second retrospective study showed people with OSA and diastolic heart failure and adherent to PAP had 36% fewer ER visits, 57% fewer hospitalizations, and incurred 18% lower related costs (an average $12,732 vs. $15,610) over 1 year. This study analyzed 1,926 people, again exactly half adherent on PAP, half non-adherent. It also found that converting a non-adherent PAP user in this study to an adherent one would save them an average 1.25 visits.The studies hold significant implications for managing heart failure patients, since 76% of them also have sleep apnea.1“Since 3 out of 4 people with heart failure also have sleep apnea,1 these findings underscore the significant role PAP treatment plays in keeping people healthy and out of the hospital,” said Fatima Sert Kuniyoshi, MSc, PhD, lead author and ResMed clinical research director. “I hope this leads to a greater emphasis on PAP prescription and monitoring for the sake of patients as well as the hospitals and ERs that would otherwise require added beds and resources to care for them.”Story continuesAlso from SLEEP: 200 million women have mild OSAResMed supported 10 abstracts presented this week at SLEEP 2023, including a global multi-study analysis that estimated over 200 million women worldwide have mild obstructive sleep apnea. That’s equal to 13.4% of women ages 30-70 – or over 1 in 8.The study’s abstract points out that while PAP treatment is beneficial in treating mild OSA, the key to optimizing health outcomes is first diagnosing it – particularly in women: “Females with OSA tend to be milder than their male counterparts, with lower AHIs, less oxygen desaturations, and different symptoms such as fatigue and insomnia. [Therefore], females with mild OSA are at risk of being underdiagnosed and undertreated.”Overall, an estimated 936 million people worldwide have sleep apnea, ranging from mild (5-14 apneic events per hour) to severe (over 30 per hour).2About ResMed At ResMed (NYSE: RMD, ASX: RMD) we pioneer innovative solutions that treat and keep people out of the hospital, empowering them to live healthier, higher-quality lives.

296,04ea9269-9fcd-3f2b-8d6c-e1db3b15ad59,PNR,2023-06-09,Factors That Make Manitowoc (MTW) a Lucrative Bet Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/factors-manitowoc-mtw-lucrative-bet-163700659.html,1686242220,STORY,"['MTW', 'HUBB', 'PNR']","[The Manitowoc Company MTW has been benefiting from improving demand and pricing actions. Its efforts to cut down prices have helped negate the impacts of higher costs and supply-chain headwinds. Increased spending on infrastructure in the United States and the Middle East will translate into higher order levels, going forward. Efforts to bring innovative products and grow its higher margin non-new machine sales will also aid growth.Top Zacks Rank &amp; Upbeat Price PerformanceMTW currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).Shares of the company have gained 37.9% in a year’s time compared with the industry’s  6% growth. The Zacks Industrial Products sector has gained 7.8% and the S&amp;P 500 composite has risen 6.4% in the same time frame. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Solid Q1 EarningsManitowoc reported revenues of $508 million in the first quarter of 2023 which improved 10.7% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) for the quarter were 46 cents which marked a substantial improvement from the earnings of 3 cents reported in the year-ago quarter. The company beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both metrics. MTW has an impressive trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 256%, on average.Upbeat Outlook for 2023Orders in the first quarter of 2023 increased 9% year over year to $525 million. The backlog at the end of the quarter was $1,076 million, up from $1,033 million reported in the last-year quarter. Backed by this momentum, Manitowoc expects revenues of $2-$2.1 billion for 2023. The company reported revenues of $2.03 billion in 2022. Adjusted EPS is expected between 35 cents and $1.15, compared with $1.06 in 2022.Upward Revision in EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for MTW’s earnings for 2023 has moved up 29% over the past 60 days and is currently pegged at $1.10 per share. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings has also seen a northward revision of 11% to $1.27 per share.Demand Prospects Hold PromiseIn North America, demand from residential and non-residential construction is driving demand for Manitowoc’s equipment. Due to the U.S. Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the rising investment in roads, bridges, airports and waterways represents a massive opportunity. The company expects demand in the Middle East to be robust in the upcoming quarters. Qatar and Kuwait are also showing signs of growth. This bodes well for Manitowoc. Further, the pressing need to replace the aging crane fleet will support the demand for Manitowoc’s equipment.Story continuesEfforts to Grow Aftermarket Sales to Reap BenefitsTo achieve sustainable growth in both sales and earnings, Manitowoc is now placing greater emphasis on growing non-new machine sales (aftermarket parts, services, rentals, used cranes, and digital solutions). Growing this part of the business will provide it with more annuity-like revenue streams that will help lessen the impact of the crane market cyclicality. Also, this business carries higher margin rates than new crane sales. The company estimates that non-new machine revenues were $567 million in the trailing twelve months ended Mar 31, 2023, and it expects to take this figure to $675 million by 2026.Manitowoc acquired the crane business of H&amp;E Equipment Services, Inc HEES in October 2021 to expand its ability to provide rentals, new sales, used sales, aftermarket parts, and service to a variety of end market customers. H&amp;E’s crane business operates with 11 full-service branch locations. The purchase of H&amp;E’s crane business is an important step in its journey to grow the less cyclical part of its business.Solid Balance Sheet Bodes WellAs of Mar 31, 2023, Manitowoc had a total liquidity of $296 million. The company’s total debt-to-total capital ratio was at 0.41 as of Mar 31, 2023. The total debt-to-total capital ratio has gone down considerably over the years from 0.62 as of 2015. The company remains focused on cash preservation and balance sheet management while funding critical programs for future growth.MTW continues to evaluate acquisition opportunities to accelerate product development programs in its all-terrain product line.  Manitowoc’s innovation pipeline remains robust. Focus on innovation will continue to aid it in leading the industry by providing differentiated products that add value to customers.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks from the Industrial Products sector are Hubbell Incorporated HUBB and Pentair plc PNR. HUBB sports a Zacks Rank of 1 at present and PNR carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Hubbell has an average trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 21%.

MDLZ has been benefiting from its core chocolate and biscuit categories. The company has also been focused on strengthening areas with higher growth potential through prudent buyouts and divestitures. Strength in the emerging markets has also been a driver amid global cost inflation.The abovementioned upsides fueled Mondelez’s first-quarter 2023 results, wherein the top and bottom lines increased year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Backed by stellar year-to-date performance, management raised its 2023 organic net revenue and earnings guidance. The raised guidance includes expectations of continued strength in the emerging markets region.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has increased from $3.18 to $3.20 over the past 30 days. Let’s delve deeper.Mondelez International, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMondelez International, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Mondelez International, Inc. QuoteFactors Working WellAs consumers prefer snacking over traditional meals, the company’s core categories — chocolates and biscuits — have historically depicted resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions. Consumers in developed countries consider chocolates and biscuits as affordable indulgences and one of the most-valued snacking products.The company’s core chocolate and biscuits categories remain sustainable in both developed and emerging markets. Both these categories registered double-digit growth in the first quarter. Management is focused on expanding these categories, as they have considerable scope for growth (in terms of penetration and per capita consumption). Notably, Mondelez intends to generate around 90% of its revenues through these two core categories in the long run.Mondelez has always been keen on expanding its business through acquisitions and alliances. The company closed the Ricolino buyout last year, which is expected to strengthen its Mexico business. In August 2022, it closed the buyout of Clif Bar. Mondelez acquired Chipita S.A. business in January 2022, a major producer of sweet and salty snacks in Central and Eastern Europe. Contributions from Ricolino, Clif Bar and Chipita buyouts boosted net revenues in the first quarter of 2023.Story continues Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Cost Woes to be OffsetMondelez has been battling cost inflation for a while now. In the first quarter of 2023, the adjusted gross profit margin contracted by 170 basis points (bps) to 37.1% due to increased raw material and transportation costs. Also, the adjusted operating income margin contracted by 60 bps to 17.2% due to inflated input costs. At the first quarter of 2023 earnings release, Mondelez stated that it expects another year of double-digit inflation stemming from continued elevated costs in packaging, energy, ingredients and labor.Nonetheless, the aforementioned drivers are likely to help the company battle the cost challenges and fuel growth.Solid Q1 &amp; ViewFirst-quarter results gained from ongoing pricing actions to offset cost inflation and volume gains. The company witnessed broad-based demand in developed and emerging markets, with strength in baked snacks, chocolate and biscuit categories and brands. Adjusted earnings were 89 cents per share, which increased 9.9% year over year and 17.3% on a constant-currency (cc) basis. The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 80 cents per share. Net revenues advanced 18.1% year over year to $9,166 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8,432.1 million.Mondelez now expects 2023 organic net revenues growth of more than 10% compared with 5-7% projected earlier. Management also anticipates adjusted EPS growth on a cc basis of more than 10%. The company had earlier expected the metric to grow in high-single digits.Shares of the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have rallied 11.4% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 6%.Better-Ranked Food BetsSome better-ranked food stocks are Lamb Weston LW, The Kraft Heinz Company KHC and Conagra Brands CAG.Lamb Weston, which operates as a frozen potato product company, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

You can skip our detailed discussion on the healthcare sector and its performance, and go directly to read 5 Healthcare Stocks Billionaires Are Loading Up On. The healthcare sector in the US is a multifaceted industry that plays a crucial role in providing medical services to the population. The sector overall includes healthcare providers, health insurers, MedTech companies, pharmaceuticals, and research and development companies. The healthcare sector demonstrated resilience over the years mainly because of its defensive nature. The stable demand for medical products and services also contributes to the sector’s performance during recessionary periods. BlackRock reported that the healthcare industry outperformed the broader market over the last seven recessionary periods by an average of 10.3%.Last year’s financial turmoil altered the investment landscape as investors struggled to balance their portfolios due to persistent interest rate hikes and growing inflation. The healthcare sector emerged as one of the winners in 2022, with the S&amp;P 500 Healthcare Index falling by just 2.44%, compared with an 18.5% decline in the S&amp;P 500.Also read: 15 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy NowApart from their defensive nature, another reason for the outperformance of the healthcare sector is its adaptability to address the challenges and changes brought about by the pandemic of 2020. The rapid expansion of telehealth gave way to improved healthcare services, particularly for individuals in rural or underserved areas. In 2022, 68% of physicians offered virtual health options, up from 14% in the prior year, according to Deloitte’s data we reported in 14 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks to Buy.

It is among the healthcare stocks billionaires are loading up on alongside Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS).In May, TD Cowen raised its price target on Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) to $616 with an Outperform rating on the shares, highlighting the company's business stability.Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) is also a dividend stock and has raised its payouts for 6 years in a row. The company pays a quarterly dividend of $0.885 per share and has a dividend yield of 0.69%, as of June 7.At the end of Q1 2023, 68 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey reported having stakes in Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), up from 67 in the previous quarter. These stakes have a collective value of over $3.78 billion. Billionaire Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners was the company's leading stakeholder in Q1.14. Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT)Number of Billionaire Investors: 15 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is an American multinational healthcare and medical devices company. In May, Morgan Stanley assumed its coverage on the stock with an Equal Weight rating and a $112 price target. The firm mentioned that the stock's valuation is now looking fair.In the first quarter of 2023, the company posted revenue of $9.7 billion and reported a 10% year-over-year growth in its organic sales on an underlying basis. The company is also a Dividend King with 51 years of consecutive dividend growth. It pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share for a dividend yield of 1.99%, as recorded on June 7.Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is one of the most popular healthcare stocks among billionaires. Ray Dalio, Cliff Asness, and Ken Griffin were some of the most popular billionaire investors having stakes in the company.Overall, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) was a part of 70 hedge fund portfolios in Q1 2023, up from 60 in the previous quarter. The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $2.37 billion.Polen Capital mentioned Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“As stated below in the portfolio activity section, Abbott Laboratories (NYSE:ABT) is expected to see roughly $6 billion in COVID test sales evaporate this year, creating a headwind for margins and underlying earnings per share. As long-term owners of the business, these test sales were never part of our original investment case. The core business, our primary focus, has a clear path of growing high single digits in 2023 with durable growth beyond, in our view. We believe the current price of 23x NTM P/E , while reasonable, is also misleading considering earnings this year will be artificially depressed because of the drop in COVID testing sales. On normalized earnings, the price is lower. We anticipate underlying EPS growth of at least low-teens over the next three to five years.Lastly, we trimmed Abbott Laboratories, bringing it back to a more average position size and to also fund our increase in Thermo Fisher. Abbott is entering a year in which the company is expected to see approximately $6bn in COVID-19 test sales disappear, thus, creating a headwind for margins and EPS. That said, the core business has a clear path to growing high single digits in FY23. EPS grew at a 20% CAGR from 2019-2022, far beyond our expectations when we initiated our investment. Now, we expect a more normal growth rate of low teens EPS beyond this year. Further, management’s adeptness at allocating capital continues to impress us. We expect Abbott to drive top line growth without heavily investing in R&amp;D and SG&amp;A this year— management effectively “front-loaded” those investments in 2021 and 2022 when COVID test sales created a bolus of cash. We believe this should allow for leverage on the operating margin going forward. Combined, Abbott and Thermo Fisher now represent 7% of the Portfolio.”13. McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK)Number of Billionaire Investors: 15 Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) is a Texas-based company that distributes pharmaceuticals and provides other care management tools.

When we first established the position in 2018, we explained that, “Although headlines remind us daily of growing threats to the business, the actual probability of this business dramatically changing in the next five years is much lower than the perceived probability. We are simply betting that the future might not be as bad as the price suggests.”Consensus FY22 and FY23 EPS estimates at the time were around $17 – $18 per share. The company reported ~ $24 in earnings in FY22, and is on pace for $26 in FY23, even as consensus estimates for the broader market were repeatedly revised lower. We continued to trim our position throughout the year as shares rerated higher from ~ 8x earnings in FY18 to ~ 16x earnings at recent highs.”12. Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc.

(NASDAQ:DXCM) in its Q1 2023 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:“We started a position in DexCom, Inc. (NASDAQ:DXCM), a medical device company that sells continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices for people with diabetes. DexCom is in the early stages of the launch of its seventh-generation device called the G7, which offers many new features, including 60% smaller size, a disposable transmitter, and 30-minute sensor warmup, among other features. We think the G7 will drive revenue growth acceleration through continued penetration in the core insulin-intensive diabetes population globally. In addition, Medicare recently decided to provide coverage of CGM for people with Type 2 diabetes who are basal insulin users, meaning people with diabetes who use insulin daily but don’t need to use insulin intensively at every meal or multiple times daily. This expanded coverage adds millions of people to DexCom’s addressable market. Over the long term, we believe DexCom will have an opportunity to expand into the even larger category of non-insulin users with Type 2 diabetes given the benefits of CGM in helping all people manage their diabetes.”10.

The company offered exposure to therapeutics in obesity and diabetes via the launch of Mounjaro, as well as in Alzheimer’s via Donanemab which was filed in November 2022 for accelerated Phase 3 approval in mid-2023. While the company reported decent fiscal fourth quarter results, shares detracted from performance after a modest miss in their obesity and diabetes drug. Mounjaro.

NARI recently announced the commercial launch of two new purpose-built products, the RevCore thrombectomy catheter and the Triever16 Curve catheter. RevCore is currently the first mechanical thrombectomy device designed to address venous in-stent thrombosis, whereas the Triever16 Curve catheter is the latest addition to Inari Medical’s FlowTriever platform.The latest launches are expected to significantly solidify Inari Medical’s foothold in the Venous Stent Thrombosis and Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) treatment space globally.Significance of the LaunchPer Inari Medical’s estimates, approximately half a million venous stents have been placed in the United States in the past few years. However, the company also confirmed that venous in-stent thrombosis is an increasingly common occurrence, affecting more patients every year. Inari Medical believes that RevCore will likely be able to address this issue as this is a solution for an entirely new patient pool, which is not currently addressed by the ClotTriever or FlowTriever platforms.Per Inari Medical, the Triever16 Curve catheter, which features a pre-shaped curve for targeted aspiration, is purpose-built to be versatile for both pulmonary embolism and peripheral thrombectomy. Triever16 Curve offers unique advantages over 16F continuous aspiration catheters, including compatibility with the FlowSaver blood return system and simple access to larger, more powerful 20F or 24F catheters within the company’s price-per-procedure model.An expert familiar with RevCore believes that it is an innovative tool as it physically removes in-stent thrombus and restores flow. It could also potentially reduce the need for additional reintervention. Another medical personnel commented that with the availability of the Triever16 Curve catheter, a wider VTE patient population will likely be served.Industry ProspectsPer a report by Future Market Insights, the global VTE treatment market was estimated to be $1.53 billion and is anticipated to reach $1.91 billion in 2029 at a CAGR of 3.7%. Factors like the increasing pervasiveness of cardiovascular diseases and cancer due to the adoption of smoking and increasing obesity rate, the rising elderly population and technological advancements are likely to drive the market.Story continuesGiven the market potential, the commercial launches are likely to provide a significant boost to Inari Medical’s business globally.Notable DevelopmentsLast month, Inari Medical announced planned enrollment of the PEERLESS II trial, its third randomized controlled trial (RCT) in VTE. PEERLESS II is a prospective, global, multi-center RCT comparing the outcomes of intermediate-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) patients treated with the FlowTriever system versus anticoagulation alone.The same month, Inari Medical announced its first-quarter 2023 results, wherein it registered a solid uptick in its year-over-year revenues. Management also confirmed the receipt of FDA clearances for several new products that are expected to drive market expansion while safeguarding the company from both existing and future competition.In March, Inari Medical announced positive results from the FLAME study in high-risk/massive PE. FLAME is the largest prospective study of interventional treatment in high-risk PE, a patient population with a historical mortality rate of 25-50%.Price PerformanceShares of the company have lost 6.7% in the past year against the industry’s 4.3% rise and the S&amp;P 500's 6.4% growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksCurrently, Inari Medical carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space are Hologic, Inc.

The results are being presented at the Annual European Hematology Association (EHA) Congress.""The updated results from both the TDT and SCD trials are remarkable and bring the promise of an autologous CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited cell therapy one-step closer to patients who are waiting,"" said Carmen Bozic, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex.""This analysis confirms the potential of exa-cel to render patients transfusion-independent or VOC-free, with significant improvement in their quality of life and physical performance,"" said Franco Locatelli, M.D., Ph.D., Professor of Pediatrics at the Sapienza University of Rome, Director of the Department of Pediatric Hematology and Oncology at Bambino Gesù Children’s Hospital. ""This therapy offers the potential of a functional cure for patients with transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia or severe sickle cell disease along with a favorable safety profile.""New Data From Pre-Specified Interim Analyses in exa-cel Pivotal TrialsBoth CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121 met their primary endpoint and key secondary endpoint at the pre-specified interim analysis for each trial. These analyses evaluated the efficacy and safety of exa-cel in patients with TDT or SCD in the ongoing Phase 3 trials as well as in the long-term follow up trial CLIMB-131. The data shared are from 83 patients (48 with TDT and 35 with SCD) dosed with exa-cel with follow-up up to 43.7 months. All patients treated with exa-cel demonstrated clinical benefit, and these data continue to demonstrate the potentially transformative profile of exa-cel.Story continuesEfficacy of exa-cel in Patients With Transfusion-Dependent Beta ThalassemiaOf the 48 patients with TDT who had received exa-cel at the time of the analysis, more than half (58.3%) have genotypes associated with severe disease, beta-zero/beta-zero or other beta-zero-like severe genotypes. At the time of the data cut, 27 TDT patients were evaluable for the primary and key secondary endpoint.24/27 (88.9%) achieved the primary endpoint of transfusion-independence for at least 12 consecutive months (TI12) and the secondary endpoint of transfusion-independence for at least 6 consecutive months (TI6) with a mean weighted hemoglobin of at least 9 g/dL (95% CI: 70.8%, 97.6%; P&lt;0.0001). Mean duration of transfusion-independence was 20.5 months with a maximum of 40.7 months.Of the 3 patients who did not achieve TI12, one patient has since stopped transfusions and has been transfusion-free for 2.9 months; the remaining 2 patients have had substantial reductions (80% and 96%) in transfusion volume from baseline.Increases in total hemoglobin occurred early within the first few months and were maintained over time. In the analysis of all patients who received exa-cel, mean total hemoglobin was ≥11g/dL at Month 3 and ≥12g/dL from Month 6 onward with pancellular distribution of fetal hemoglobin.Mean proportion of edited BCL11A alleles was stable over time in bone marrow and peripheral blood indicating successful permanent editing in the long-term hematopoietic stem cells.Patients also had clinically significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes.Efficacy of exa-cel in Patients With Severe Sickle Cell DiseaseOf the 35 patients with SCD who had received exa-cel at the time of the analysis, 17 patients were evaluable for the primary and key secondary endpoint at the time of the data cut.16/17 (94.1%) achieved the primary endpoint of freedom from vaso-occlusive crises (VOCs) for at least 12 consecutive months (VF12) (95% CI: 71.3%, 99.9%; P=0.0001). Mean duration of VOC-free was 18.7 months, with a maximum of 36.5 months. 17/17 (100%) achieved the key secondary endpoint of being free from hospitalizations related to VOCs for at least 12 consecutive months (HF12) (95% CI: 80.5%, 100.0%; P&lt;0.0001).The one patient who did not achieve VF12 did achieve HF12 and has a complex set of comorbidities, including a history of chronic pain.One patient who achieved VF12 had a VOC 22.8 months following exa-cel infusion in the setting of a parvovirus infection. This patient has since fully recovered from the infection and been VOC-free.Increases in fetal hemoglobin and total hemoglobin occurred early, within the first few months, and were maintained over time. In the analysis of all patients who received exa-cel, mean fetal hemoglobin was more than 30% of total hemoglobin by Month 3 and was then maintained at approximately 40.0% through follow-up, with pancellular distribution.Mean proportion of edited BCL11A alleles was stable over time in bone marrow and peripheral blood, indicating successful permanent editing in the long-term hematopoietic stem cells.Patients also had clinically significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes.Safety of exa-cel in All PatientsThe safety profile of exa-cel was generally consistent with myeloablative conditioning with busulfan and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. All patients engrafted neutrophils and platelets after exa-cel infusion.As previously reported, two TDT patients had serious adverse events (SAEs) considered related to exa-cel. One patient had three SAEs considered related to exa-cel: hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), acute respiratory distress syndrome and headache, and one SAE of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome that was considered related to both exa-cel and busulfan. All four SAEs occurred in the context of HLH in the peri-engraftment period and have resolved. One patient had SAEs of delayed neutrophil engraftment and thrombocytopenia, both of which were considered related to exa-cel and busulfan, and both SAEs have resolved. Among the 35 patients with SCD, there were no SAEs considered related to exa-cel.Also as previously reported, one adult patient with SCD developed pneumonia and respiratory failure following SARS-CoV-2 infection, resulting in death. The investigator assessed the events as not related to exa-cel. There were no other deaths or discontinuations, and there have been no malignancies in either study.These data will be shared as outlined below:Abstract S270 will be an oral presentation entitled ""Transfusion Independence and Elimination of Vaso-Occlusive Crises After Exagamglogene Autotemcel For Transfusion-Dependent Βeta-Thalassemia and Severe Sickle Cell Disease,"" on Sunday, June 11 at 11:30 CEST. This presentation will include updated pivotal trial data from patients treated with exa-cel in CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121 and followed in CLIMB‑131. This abstract was chosen for the media briefing program.In addition, three health economics abstracts from Vertex have been accepted for poster presentation on Friday, June 9 at 18:00 CEST.Abstract P1452 is entitled ""Mortality and Clinical Complications Among Patients With Transfusion-Dependent Beta-Thalassemia in Italy.""Abstract P1447 is entitled ""Mortality and Clinical Complications Among Patients With Sickle Cell Disease With Recurrent Vaso-Occlusive Crises in Italy.""Abstract P1464 is entitled ""Clinical Complications Among Patients With Transfusion-Dependent Beta-Thalassemia in Germany.""About exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel)Exa-cel is an investigational, autologous, ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited cell therapy that is being evaluated for patients with SCD or TDT, in which a patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells are edited to produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF; hemoglobin F) in red blood cells. HbF is the form of the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin that is naturally present during fetal development, which then switches to the adult form of hemoglobin after birth. The elevation of HbF by exa-cel has the potential to reduce or eliminate painful and debilitating VOCs for patients with SCD and alleviate transfusion requirements for patients with TDT. Earlier results from these ongoing trials were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in January of 2021 and presented at the American Society of Hematology Annual Congress in 2022.Exa-cel has been granted Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT), Fast Track, Orphan Drug, and Rare Pediatric Disease designations from the U.S. FDA for both TDT and SCD. The FDA has accepted the Biologics License Applications (BLAs) for exa-cel and assigned Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) action dates of December 8, 2023, for SCD and March 30, 2024, for TDT.In the EU, exa-cel has been granted Orphan Drug Designation from the European Commission, as well as Priority Medicines (PRIME) designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA), for both SCD and TDT. In the U.K., exa-cel has also been granted an Innovation Passport under the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway (ILAP) from the Medicines Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). In Europe, the Marketing Authorization Applications (MAAs) for exa-cel were submitted in December 2022 and validated by the EMA and MHRA in January 2023.About CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121The ongoing Phase 1/2/3 open-label trials, CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121, are designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of exa-cel in patients ages 12 to 35 years with TDT or with SCD, characterized by recurrent VOCs, respectively. The trials are now closed for enrollment. Patients will be followed for approximately two years after exa-cel infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB-131, a long-term follow-up trial.About CLIMB-131The ongoing long-term, open-label trial, CLIMB-131, is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of exa-cel in patients who received exa-cel in CLIMB-111, CLIMB-121, CLIMB-141, CLIMB-151 or CLIMB-161. The trial is designed to follow participants for up to 15 years after exa-cel infusion.About CLIMB-141 and CLIMB-151The ongoing Phase 3 open-label trials, CLIMB-141 and CLIMB-151, are designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of exa-cel in patients ages 2 to 11 years with TDT or with SCD, characterized by recurrent VOCs, respectively. The trials are now open for enrollment and currently enrolling patients ages 5 to 11 years with the plan to extend to ages 2 to less than 5 years at a later date. Each trial will enroll approximately 15 patients. Patients will be followed for approximately two years after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB-131, a long-term follow-up trial.About CLIMB-161The ongoing Phase 3b trial, CLIMB-161, is to support expansion of our manufacturing footprint after initial potential approval and launch. This trial will enroll approximately 12 patients with either TDT or with SCD, characterized by recurrent VOCs, ages 12 to 35 years. Patients will be followed for approximately one year after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB-131, a long-term follow-up trial.About the Gene-Editing Process in These TrialsPatients who enroll in these trials will have their own hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells collected from peripheral blood. The patient’s cells will be edited using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The edited cells, exa-cel, will then be infused back into the patient as part of an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), a process which involves a patient being treated with myeloablative busulfan conditioning. Patients undergoing HSCT may also encounter side effects (ranging from mild to severe) that are unrelated to the administration of exa-cel. Patients will initially be monitored to determine when the edited cells begin to produce mature blood cells, a process known as engraftment. After engraftment, patients will continue to be monitored to track the impact of exa-cel on multiple measures of disease and for safety.About the Vertex and CRISPR CollaborationVertex and CRISPR Therapeutics entered into a strategic research collaboration in 2015 focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease. ‑Exa-cel represents the first potential treatment to emerge from the joint research program.

In the U.K., exa-cel has also been granted an Innovation Passport under the Innovative Licensing and Access Pathway (ILAP) from the MHRA.About exagamglogene autotemcel (exa-cel)Exa-cel is an investigational, autologous, ex vivo CRISPR/Cas9 gene-edited therapy that is being evaluated for patients with SCD or TDT, in which a patient’s own hematopoietic stem cells are edited to produce high levels of fetal hemoglobin (HbF; hemoglobin F) in red blood cells. HbF is the form of the oxygen-carrying hemoglobin that is naturally present during fetal development, which then switches to the adult form of hemoglobin after birth. The elevation of HbF by exa-cel has the potential to reduce or eliminate painful and debilitating VOCs for patients with SCD and alleviate transfusion requirements for patients with TDT. Earlier results from these ongoing trials were published in The New England Journal of Medicine in January of 2021 and presented at the American Society of Hematology Annual Congress in 2022.About CLIMB‑111 and CLIMB‑121The ongoing Phase 1/2/3 open-label trials, CLIMB-111 and CLIMB-121, are designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of exa-cel in patients ages 12 to 35 years with TDT or with SCD, characterized by recurrent VOCs, respectively. The trials are now closed for enrollment. Patients will be followed for approximately two years after exa-cel infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB-131, a long-term follow-up trial.About CLIMB-131The ongoing long-term, open-label trial, CLIMB-131, is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of exa-cel in patients who received exa-cel in CLIMB-111, CLIMB-121, CLIMB-141, CLIMB-151 or CLIMB-161. The trial is designed to follow participants for up to 15 years after exa-cel infusion.About CLIMB‑141 and CLIMB‑151The ongoing Phase 3 open-label trials, CLIMB-141 and CLIMB-151, are designed to assess the safety and efficacy of a single dose of exa-cel in patients ages 2 to 11 years with TDT or with SCD, characterized by recurrent VOCs, respectively. The trials are now open for enrollment and currently enrolling patients ages 5 to 11 years with the plan to extend to ages 2 to less than 5 years at a later date. Each trial will enroll approximately 15 patients. Patients will be followed for approximately two years after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB-131, a long-term follow-up trial.About CLIMB-161The ongoing Phase 3b trial, CLIMB-161, is to support expansion of our manufacturing footprint after initial potential approval and launch. This trial will enroll approximately 12 patients with either TDT or with SCD, characterized by recurrent VOCs, ages 12 to 35 years. Patients will be followed for approximately one year after infusion. Each patient will be asked to participate in CLIMB-131, a long-term follow-up trial.About the Gene-Editing Process in These TrialsPatients who enroll in these trials will have their own hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells collected from peripheral blood. The patient’s cells will be edited using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. The edited cells, exa-cel, will then be infused back into the patient as part of an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), a process which involves a patient being treated with myeloablative busulfan conditioning. Patients undergoing HSCT may also encounter side effects (ranging from mild to severe) that are unrelated to the administration of exa-cel. Patients will initially be monitored to determine when the edited cells begin to produce mature blood cells, a process known as engraftment. After engraftment, patients will continue to be monitored to track the impact of exa-cel on multiple measures of disease and for safety.About the Vertex and ‑CRISPR CollaborationVertex and CRISPR Therapeutics entered into a strategic research collaboration in 2015 focused on the use of CRISPR/Cas9 to discover and develop potential new treatments aimed at the underlying genetic causes of human disease.

Wade, activist investors are pushing companies to disclose the impact new abortion rights laws could have their businesses. Yahoo Finance legal reporter Alexis Kennan breaks down what investors want to know.Video TranscriptRACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, the constitutional right to abortion was revoked last year when the Supreme Court overturned Roe v Wade. Now as we follow up on, this activist investors are pushing major companies to disclose the impact the new limitations have on their businesses. Joining us now is Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan to break it all down for us. Hey, Alexis.ALEXIS KEENAN: Hi, Rachelle. So yeah, the number of shareholder proposals that relate to abortion access, they doubled from last year's proxy season to this year's. And the number this year reached about 30. And the big takeaway here is that all of the proposals and Yahoo Finance's counted about 16 of them, all of them that went to a vote, they said no to the idea of requiring that companies explain the financial as well as reputational risks that they face now that women have no constitutional right to abortion.Now take a look at some of the companies that face these types of votes. They go across industries. Meta, Google, Costco, Home Depot, Coca-Cola, Pfizer, Walmart and Comcast as well. Comcast just had its vote yesterday. Preliminary results show also a no there to these issues.Now let's talk specifically about what these measures entail. By and large, these proposals, they sought disclosures from these companies on matters like how companies handle abortion-related customer data in response to law enforcement or potential law enforcement requests, also how their political contributions to candidates conflict with their company's stated values, also how state abortion limitations can impact hiring as well as retaining and relocating workers, and also on the other side of the issue, the potential risks of even supporting abortion.Story continuesSo altogether, Yahoo Finance reviewed about these 30 proposals that were on the table this year. Some of them though were withdrawn before a vote. And in some cases, those withdrawals can be seen as a success by their proponents because they forced companies to make some changes. And one of those is CVS. They faced a proposal, but before it went to a vote, the company agreed to provide some greater protections around their customers' health care data.But certainly this is part of a wider ESG push. But we're seeing on both sides of the political and ideological aisles here, these issues coming to a fore. But just a huge uptick this year in the number of abortion related matters on the table that doubling from last year. Just a significant, significant change despite the fact that these were virtually all no-votes so far. Rachelle?RACHELLE AKUFFO: Certainly a lot of people seeking some clarity here, at least not getting it for now. A big thank you, Yahoo Finance's Alexis Keenan. Thanks so much.]"

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.Story continuesZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.ABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.Is KO a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Coke, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $2.61.Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Coke. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Coke.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at Waste Management's (NYSE:WM) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Waste Management, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.13 = US$3.5b ÷ (US$31b - US$3.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Waste Management has an ROCE of 13%.  On its own, that's a standard return, however it's much better than the 8.5% generated by the Commercial Services industry. View our latest analysis for Waste Management roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Waste Management compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Waste Management here  for free.So How Is Waste Management's ROCE Trending?The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 13% and the business has deployed 46% more capital into its operations. Since 13% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Waste Management's ROCEThe main thing to remember is that Waste Management has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 112% return they've received over the last five years. So even though the stock might be more ""expensive"" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Waste Management and understanding this should be part of your investment process.While Waste Management may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Net sales increased around 8.7% from $2,945.1 million reported in the prior-year quarter.The top line was driven primarily by higher pricing across the regions and higher volumes, in the reported quarter.Segment HighlightsRevenues in the Americas segment were up 16% year over year to $1,373.1 million. The upside was driven by higher volumes and pricing, partly offset by unfavorable currency swings.Revenues in the Europe segment rose 2% year over year to $752.9 million.

The upside was backed by operational efficiencies, accretive acquisitions and successful inflation mitigation initiatives.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWhat's Driving the Outperformance?TopBuild has been recording solid earnings and revenue growth over the last few quarters. In first-quarter 2023, the company’s sales increased 8.2%, adjusted earnings per share grew 24.6%, the adjusted gross margin expanded 180 bps and the adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 150 bps from the prior-year period’s levels. The impressive margin expansion led to increased profitability, depicting a flexible operating model and its ability to quickly reduce costs. The impressive performance was backed by higher sales volume and higher selling prices in both segments of the company along with contributions from acquisitions. Also, operational efficiencies, fixed-cost leverage and the ongoing success in managing inflation aided the company.Acquisitions are an important part of the company’s growth strategy to supplement organic growth and expand access to additional markets and products. On Jan 26, 2023, BLD completed this year’s first acquisition by acquiring SRI Holdings, which is a residential insulation installation company.In 2022, BLD made five insulation company acquisitions, which are expected to generate $17.3 million in revenues annually, including CV Insulation, LLC., Assured Insulating, which serves markets in North-eastern Texas and North-western Louisiana, Green Energy (located in Orego), Billings (located in Montana), Southwest (located in Florida). The increase in net sales of BLD in first-quarter 2023 was partially driven by these acquisitions, which contributed 1.3% to sales growth. The company is focused on driving top-line growth, the successful integration of DI and improving operational efficiencies. Meanwhile, the company remains committed to its long-term outlook.BLD maintains a strong liquidity position. Cash and cash equivalents at first-quarter 2023-end were $333.8 million, up from $240.1 million at 2022-end.

The positive trend signifies bullish analyst sentiments, indicating robust fundamentals and sparking the expectation of outperformance in the near term.DHI highlighted that net sales orders increased 73% in second-quarter fiscal 2023 from the previous quarter. The company believes that housing demand will remain favorable, courtesy of a limited supply of new and existing homes at affordable price points despite challenging market conditions, comprising higher rates and uncertain economic conditions.Let’s delve deeper into the factors favoring this Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Growth DriversSolid Land Investments: D.R. Horton’s strong cash position and low debt/capital ratio allowed it to make strategic land purchases even during the downturn, in turn, giving it a significant competitive advantage. The company has selectively invested in attractively-priced land and lots in the past few years allowing it to bring new attractive communities in desirable markets. For the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, the company invested $900 million and $980 million in finished lots, $690 million and $590 million in land development, and $130 million and $150 million in acquiring land, respectively.Profit From Entry-Level Homes: D.R. Horton’s strategic shift toward more entry-level affordable homes has been paying off, with the segment experiencing strong demand and limited supply. First-time homebuyers represented 55% of its closings in second-quarter fiscal 2023.High-Return Strategies: DHI strategically manages pricing, incentives and sales pace across its markets in a manner that will optimize the returns on inventory investments. It believes a consistent sales pace through inventory turnover is the best way to maximize profits and returns. With 547,000 lots (25% were owned and 75% controlled through purchase contracts) in inventory at the end of second-quarter fiscal 2023, D.R. Horton is well-poised for the future.Story continuesOther Key PicksSome other better-ranked stocks that investors may consider from the same sector include Martin Marietta Materials, Inc.

320,913c070b-323e-3a4d-900a-5839c4fd8dbc,PGR,2023-06-09,11 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/11-best-health-insurance-stocks-115951551.html,1686311991,STORY,"['HUM', 'UNH', 'CNC', 'MOH', 'PGR', 'WTW', 'MET', 'CVS', 'BHG']","[In this article we present the list of 11 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy.UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), and CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) are a few of the best health insurance stocks to buy now according to some of the most successful money managers in the world.The healthcare industry is one of the strongest safe havens during lean economic periods, as personal health is one of the few things most people are unwilling to compromise on, regardless of the costs. That was certainly evident in 2022, as the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund greatly outperformed the Nasdaq, S&amp;P 500, and Dow Jones.According to the American Medical Association, healthcare industry spending rose by 2.7% in 2021 to hit $4.26 trillion, which accounted for over 18% of U.S. GDP. That latter figure is twice as high as the OECD average when it comes to healthcare costs as a percentage of GDP, which underlines the vital importance of health insurance in the U.S.As healthcare costs in the country have ballooned, making it all but unaffordable out-of-pocket, health insurance has become an absolute necessity. Private health insurance covered $1.21 trillion worth of that $4.26 trillion in healthcare spending in 2021, more than Medicare and Medicaid, while just $433 billion in healthcare costs were paid out-of-pocket. Overall, more than 300 million Americans had some form of at least partial health insurance in 2022, a 40% increase since 1990.Thanks to rising interest rates, the best health insurance stocks to buy have been among the top performing healthcare stocks in the world, with many leaders in the industry raking in record profits in 2022. In the third quarter, Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), and Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC) all grew their quarterly profits by at least 26% year-over-year. In contrast, many of the biggest health system providers like HCA Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:HCA) were seeing their profits implode, with HCA’s down 50% year-over-year.Story continuesThat growing profit divide between payers and providers makes the best health insurance stocks to buy some of the most attractive in the entire healthcare industry. Check out the 15 Best Healthcare Stocks To Buy Now for some of the other top names in healthcare that hedge funds are bullish on.With their profits reaching new heights, the best insurance stocks for dividends are also becoming more attractive on the basis of their yields. While they don’t match up to the yields of many of the 14 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks to Buy, their payouts have been growing and in some cases they boast yields that now top 3%.Both fairly-valued and undervalued insurance stocks alike will have plenty of room to grow in the future, as the global health insurance market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 9.9% between 2022 and 2030 according to Straits Research, hitting $5.28 trillion by 2030. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to be the fastest-growing during that period, at a 13.8% CAGR, which gives U.S. health insurers that operate in the region, like Cigna, huge growth opportunities.11 Best Health Insurance Stocks to BuyStokkete/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe following best health insurance stocks to buy are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.11 Best Health Insurance Stocks to Buy11. Bright Health Group, Inc. (NYSE:BHG)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 6 CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), and Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) are some of the biggest health insurers in the world and have the hedge fund backing to prove it. One of the lesser known insurers on the market, and by far the least popular of the 11 best health insurance stocks to buy is Bright Health Group, Inc. (NYSE:BHG).Just six hedge funds were long Bright Health Group, Inc. (NYSE:BHG) on March 31, down 75% from the second quarter of 2021, when the Tiger Global-backed insurer first went public through an IPO. Tiger Global has since unloaded its stake in the company, as has another Tiger Cub, Lee Ainslie of Maverick Capital. The stock’s lone significant bull is Jose Fernandez’s Stepstone Group, which owns just over 42 million shares.It’s no wonder hedge funds have bailed on the stock, as Bright Health Group, Inc. (NYSE:BHG) has been in a world of hurt and facing serious liquidity concerns. As a result, the company is exploring the sale of its California Medicare Advantage business. RBC Capital lowered its price target on BHG to $13 from $80 at the end of May, while Goldman Sachs suspended its rating on the company in March (it previously had a ‘Sell’ rating on the stock), citing insufficient information in the company’s Q4 earnings report.10. Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 41 Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) pushed to a new all-time high in hedge fund ownership during the first quarter of 2023 as several funds added the company to their 13F portfolios during the quarter. Among them were Jeffrey Talpins’ Element Capital Management and Alec Litowitz and Ross Laser’s Magnetar Capital.It might surprise some people to know that Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) is the seventh-largest public health insurer in the world with 5.3 million members. While the company’s revenue and membership growth rates each came in at less than 5% year-over-year in Q1, EPS rose by 25.7% to $5.52. Analysts also expect Molina to have one of the best earnings growth rates in the industry over the next five years at a projected 17.8% annually.Carillon Tower Advisers noted the bear case on Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) has been at least partially debunked according to the firm’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Molina Healthcare, Inc. (NYSE:MOH) also performed well as sentiment toward health maintenance organizations improved, both as a relatively defensive investment during uncertain times, and as the bear case on the stock was partially debunked with an extension of expanded enrollment for government health insurance programs.”9. Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 42 Unlike Molina Healthcare, hedge funds have been bailing on Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW) over the last year-and-a-half, with smart money ownership of the stock falling by 43% during that time. Jeffrey Smith’s Starboard Value took a stake at the height of the company’s hedge fund popularity but has maintained it since then and noted at the time that the company has underperformed but that it’s also undervalued.Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW), which provides a broad range of insurance products to clients, has undergone numerous transformation initiatives in recent years. The company’s results are steadily improving, with free cash flow, margins, and organic revenue all rising, but the improvements have been slower than expected in some areas. Raymond James recently lowered its price target on WTW to $270 from $275 on the expectations that the company is likely to miss its 2024 revenue and earnings targets.Artisan Partners likes the progress Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW) is making in closing the results gap to its peers, as noted in the fund’s Q3 2022 investor letter:“Willis Towers Watson Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:WTW) shares rose 2% in the quarter. This modest increase made it one of our best performers during a difficult quarter. Absent significant news, the business continues to benefit from a hard insurance market. Results are still lagging peers, but the management team seems to be making progress in closing the gap. In the meantime, the company is returning significant amounts of capital to shareholders. Over the past eight months, it has repurchased $4 billion in stock and reduced the share count by 15%. And there is more on the way. This is a good business in a fantastic industry trading at 12X normalized earnings. We believe it is worth much more.”8. MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 43 MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) is nearly as popular with hedge funds today as it was back in 2014, but smart money sentiment has gradually inched up since the final quarter of 2018, when just 25 funds were long MET. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment raised its stake in MetLife by 2,962% during Q1, giving it nearly 1.52 million shares by the end of the quarter.While many health insurers have been enjoying big earnings boosts in recent quarters, that wasn’t the case for MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET) in Q1. Adjusted earnings fell by 30% year-over-year and widely missed estimates, while revenue dipped by 9% to $11.5 billion.Analysts are bullish on MetLife, Inc. (NYSE:MET)’s $19.2 billion reinsurance agreement however, with RBC Capital analyst Mark Dwelle noting that it frees up capital, improves the company’s RBC ratio, and will allow it to execute incremental share buybacks. On the latter front, MetLife announced alongside the risk transfer transaction that it will indeed raise its share buyback allowance by a billion dollars to $4 billion.7. Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 61 There’s been a greater than 20% increase in the number of funds long Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC) over the past six quarters with the company in the midst of various transformation initiatives under new leadership. Stephen Dubois’ Camber Capital Management and Marc Majzner’s Clearline Capital are among the funds that added CNC to their 13F portfolios during Q1.Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC)’s medical membership climbed to 28.5 million in the first quarter, an 8.5% increase year-over-year. Its adjusted diluted EPS growth of 15.3% was also strong, though analysts expect a more modest 10.6% annual boost on that front over the next five years, less than the projected earnings growth for the broader industry. Partly due to those muted earnings expectations, CNC shares trade at a forward P/E of just 10.4x, well below the industry average.The Heartland Mid Cap Value Fund is bullish on the steps Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC)’s new management is undertaking to improve efficiency, as relayed in the fund’s Q1 2023 investor letter:“Health Care. During the quarter, we added to our existing position in Centene Corporation (NYSE:CNC), one of the largest managed health care insurance providers in the U.S. and the largest player in Medicaid.The stock has underperformed lately, as CNC faces headwinds on the reimbursement front, including a reduction in its 2024 Medicare Advantage reimbursements. The market also seems to fear a potential loss of insured lives when Medicaid eligibility, which was expanded during the pandemic, gets redetermined in 2023-2024.CNC hasn’t historically delivered consistent results compared to other premier managed care companies. More recently, the company upgraded its leadership ranks, including the addition of a CEO, CFO, and COO from better-managed companies with a track record of value creation. The company is undertaking a series of self-help efforts, including expense reductions, divesting noncore assets, share buybacks, and operational improvements.Despite this, the stock trades at just 10 times 2023 earnings and 9 times 2024 profits. We consider that valuation too punitive for a company that we expect to continue growing EPS at a 12-15% compound annual growth rate.”6. The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 64 Hedge fund ownership of The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) skyrocketed by more than 50% between the middle of 2021 and the end of 2022, hitting an all-time high at the end of last year. It took a dip in the latest quarter however, with several funds unloading their PGR stakes after a nice run for the stock, which gained 45% between the start of 2022 and the end of March 2023.The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) shares have dipped this year partly due to the surprising uptick in the company’s combined ratio during Q1, which rose to 99%. However, that appears to be primarily due to litigation laws involving lawsuits against insurers being updated in Florida, which led to a temporary surge in lawsuits being brought against insurers before the new laws were passed. Given its lengthy history of having a market-leading combined ratio, it shouldn’t be long before Progressive gets that figure back below its target mark of 96%.The Ariel Appreciation Fund succinctly detailed why it sold off The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) in the fund’s Q1 2023 investor letter:“Meanwhile, we successfully exited personal auto insurer, The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) as it surpassed our estimate of its private market value.” Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS), and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) are some of the top insurers in the world that hedge funds love.

However, it transitioned to a quarterly dividend payout in 2010 and since then, has been continuously hiking dividends every year.Apart from implementing dividend hikes, UNH has a well-established history of engaging in share buybacks in a bid to offer more returns to shareholders. The health insurer continues to pursue share buybacks as part of the repurchase program renewed by the Board of Directors in Jun 2018.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Big Name Stocks to Buy Now.The US economy and big business giants have a closely intertwined relationship, with these large corporations playing a significant role in shaping the economic landscape. They contribute to the growth of the US economy by driving productivity, innovation, and job creation. These companies invest heavily in research and development, which leads to the development of new technologies, products, and services. Their investments in capital infrastructure and expansion projects stimulate economic activity and create employment opportunities, supporting economic growth at both the national and local levels.Big companies are major employers, providing a significant number of jobs across a wide range of industries. They create both direct and indirect employment opportunities, contributing to lower unemployment rates and promoting economic stability. These companies often offer competitive wages, benefits, and career advancement opportunities, attracting a skilled workforce and enhancing labor market dynamics. Big business giants also have extensive supply chains, encompassing numerous suppliers, manufacturers, distributors, and service providers. Their purchasing power and demands can influence the operations and growth of their supply chain partners. As a result, these companies have the ability to support and shape the growth of smaller businesses within their supply chains, contributing to job creation and economic development. Many big companies are multinational corporations that operate globally. Their international operations contribute to the US economy through exports, foreign direct investment, and global market expansion. Their ability to compete globally enhances the competitiveness of the US economy, supporting trade and generating economic gains.Story continuesSurprisingly, the US economy is currently in a healthy state, considering the challenges it has faced, including the global pandemic, supply chain disruptions, and the impact of a war on a major global energy supplier. The labor market conditions alone provide strong support for the belief that the economy can achieve a desired soft landing, which is not uncommon despite claims suggesting otherwise. Although inflation remains a concern, it is much less worrisome than it was a year ago. If US policymakers can avoid any detrimental policy decisions, such as failing to raise the debt ceiling, the outlook is positive that the economy will continue to innovate, generate employment opportunities, and produce goods and services after a few quarters of slower growth. According to the US Bureau of Economic Analysis, the current-account deficit of the United States decreased by $12.2 billion, or 5.6%, to reach $206.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2022. The revised deficit for the third quarter was $219.0 billion. In terms of current-dollar gross domestic product (GDP), the fourth-quarter deficit accounted for 3.2%, which was a decline from 3.4% recorded in the third quarter.The US economy experienced a slowdown in the early months of 2023, with a growth rate of 1.1% on an annual basis. This decline in growth can be attributed to higher interest rates and a banking crisis that had a negative impact on various sectors. The Bureau of Economic Analysis released these latest figures, indicating a significant deceleration at a time when concerns about a recession are already looming, partly due to worries that the banking sector's challenges will restrict lending. In comparison, the US economy had grown at an annual rate of 2.6% during the last quarter of 2022. However, households continue to increase their spending, particularly on services like entertainment and travel, driven by pent-up demand. Business investment remains strong, especially in information-processing equipment and software. Some of the best big name stocks to monitor in this context include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Atlassian Corporation Plc (NASDAQ:TEAM), and Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZM). However, investment in nonresidential structures remains weak due to an oversupply of office buildings and retail spaces. The housing market experiences a true recession, with a significant slump. Economic experts believe inflation will gradually settle back by late 2023 as demand for goods slows and businesses address their supply chain issues. However, this decline in inflation might be temporary as wages rise due to the continued strength of the labor market, leading to higher costs and prices. The Federal Reserve, despite its attempts to control inflation in 2022, has found it challenging to slow down the hot labor market enough to have a significant impact, resulting in inflation settling at approximately 6%. Nominal interest rates have reached levels that would have been considered burdensome a few years ago, but the overall economic activity remains relatively strong. Our MethodologyFor this article, we selected big name stocks and ranked them based on overall hedge fund sentiment. Big name stocks are companies that have global brand capital and more than 100 hedge fund holders.

United’s operating income grew +3% on difficult year-ago comparisons as benefits members utilized more services compared to last year. Optum Health grew operating income +40% as more patients are enrolled in the Company’s value-based care services. The Company estimates nearly a third of all medical care is unnecessary and represents an opportunity to capture savings for both patients. Optum’s integrated platform of patient data, IT, and service providers are focused on driving out these unnecessary costs and should serve as the engine for long-term, mid-teens earnings per share growth.”9. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 128Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) provides technology infrastructure and marketing reach to help merchants, brands, retailers, and other businesses to engage with their users and customers in the People's Republic of China and internationally.

Here is what the fund said:“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) is the leading e-commerce company in China. The stock was weak over the quarter as they reported a quarterly revenue decline. The company has been heavily impacted by the continued covid-19 lockdowns throughout China and the aggressive rate increases and a deteriorating outlook for China’s economy have weighed heavily on the stock. The share price has also been under pressure due to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission’s plans to delist Chinese tech stocks in 2024 if they do not provide access to audit files.”8. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 136   Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) provides customer relationship management technology that brings companies and customers together worldwide. It is one of the best big name stocks to buy now. On June 7, the firm announced that it was partnering with Google Cloud in a collaboration that will enable companies to leverage their data and utilize custom machine learning models to predict customer needs.

(NYSE:CRM), compared to 117 in the preceding quarter worth $8 billion. In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Oakmark Funds, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) was one of them.

The company earns 80% gross margins and grows 20% organically. Plus, virtually all of its revenue is recurring. We see Salesforce as a great business that we’ve admired from afar for a long time. More recently, the organization has made some changes at the top that prompted us to take a closer look at the stock. New CEO Bret Taylor and CFO Amy Weaver are bringing a culture of financial discipline. We believe this renewed focus on profitability and capital return, combined with Salesforce’s strong underlying business characteristics, will yield strong results. The current valuation of 3.9x next year’s revenues represents a significant discount compared to publicly traded peers and recent private market values in the software space that have similar growth profiles. We view this discount as an opportunity to invest in a great business at a good value.”7. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 144Uber Technologies, Inc.

326,622defee-cdef-36d3-a697-7782f77435fb,UNH,2023-06-09,5 HMO Industry Stocks to Watch as Technology Expenses Take a Toll,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-hmo-industry-stocks-watch-144600977.html,1686235560,STORY,"['UNH', 'CNC', 'CI', 'HUM', '^GSPC', 'MOH']","[The U.S. health insurance industry, referred to as Health Maintenance Organization (HMO), is expected to gain on the back of growing premiums and an expanding customer base, thanks to the well-performing Government business. The industry players have an active merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) strategy in place. Though technology investments are made to boost operational efficiencies, these often escalate costs for industry players. Shortage of medical personnel across the United States is a concern. Despite the challenges, companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated UNH, The Cigna Group CI, Humana Inc. HUM, Centene Corporation CNC and Molina Healthcare, Inc. MOH appear well-placed to counter the industry headwinds.About the Industry The Zacks HMO industry consists of entities (either private or public) that take care of subscribers’ basic and supplemental health services. Companies in this space primarily assume risks and assign premiums to health and medical insurance policies. Industry participants also provide administrative and managed-care services for self-funded insurance. Services are generally provided by a network of approved care providers (called in-network), which include primary care physicians, clinical facilities, hospitals and specialists. However, out-of-network exceptions are made during emergencies or when it is medically necessary. Health insurance plans can be availed through private purchases, social insurance or social welfare programs.4 Trends Shaping the Fate of the HMO Industry A High Technology Expense Level: Telehealth services were prevalent in the United States prior to the COVID-19 pandemic but their usage was not as widespread as it has been since the onset of the pandemic. Per a report by Grand View Research, the global telehealth market is anticipated to witness a 24% CAGR over the 2023-2030 period. This impressive growth forecast indicates that demand for digital healthcare services will continue to be high. HMO players are therefore compelled to undertake technology investments to build telehealth platforms. Needless to say, the platforms fetch a steady revenue stream for industry players and boost their operational efficiencies. But tech investments might escalate costs and erode the margins of health insurers.Story continuesShortage of Medical Staff: A dearth in the availability of medical personnel is taking a toll on the efficient functioning of hospitals nationwide. An increase in the number of nurses reaching retirement age, greater life expectancy of the overall population and faculty shortages in nursing schools are some of the factors triggering a scarcity in the nursing workforce. Health insurers collaborate with hospitals, physicians and other facilities to offer discounted care access to plan members. Therefore, the effectiveness of services remains a crucial factor behind health plan renewals. A shortage in the nursing workforce can reduce a hospital’s ability to deliver quality care services and indirectly affect the customer base of HMO companies. Healthy membership growth is crucial to the premiums of health insurers.Rising Customer Base: Most of the participants in the HMO space distribute cost-effective health plans through their Government business and upgrade them from time to time. The strength of such plans leads to federal or state contract wins for HMO players.  Plan upgrades as well as contract wins bring in more customers for the industry participants and provide an impetus to premiums. Also, these provide them an opportunity to serve different underserved U.S. communities and bolster their geographic footprint. Given an aging U.S. population, the solid demand for Medicare plans (meant for 65 years and above), which form part of the abovementioned Government business, is expected to continue.Active M&amp;A Moves: An active M&amp;A strategy offers an opportunity for the industry players to advance their capabilities, enter new regions, delve deeper into existing ones and grow their customer base. The HMO stocks gain from diversification benefits that result from an active pursuit of M&amp;A deals and attain a competitive edge over industry peers. Though interest rates were increased aggressively by the Fed in order to tame inflation, the percentage of increase seems to have somewhat slowed down. This, in turn, is likely to bring down borrowing costs, making it easier for companies to opt for loans to finance M&amp;A deals and avoid complete exhaustion of cash reserves. According to Tom Miles and Brian Healy, Co-Heads of Americas M&amp;A at Morgan Stanley, the pace of such deals is likely to pick up in the second half of 2023 and beyond.Zacks Industry Rank Hints Bearish OutlookThe group’s  Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all member stocks, indicates tepid near-term prospects. The Zacks Medical-HMOs industry is housed within the broader Zacks  Medical sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #181, which places it in the bottom 28% of more than 250 Zacks industries.Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Despite the dismal scenario, we will present a few stocks that one can retain, given their solid growth endeavors. But before that, it’s worth looking at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and the valuation picture.Industry Vs. Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Medical-HMO industry has outperformed the Medical sector but underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite in the past year.In the said time frame, the industry has gained 1.5% against the Medical sector’s decline of 7.5%.

Considering the current industry scenario, it might be prudent for investors to retain these stocks in their portfolio, as these are well-placed to generate growth in the long haul.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. UnitedHealth Group: Based in Minnesota, UnitedHealth Group benefits from its solid segmental performance. While a strong Government business empowers the health insurer to gain more Medicare and Medicaid customers, the Optum unit gains on buyouts and utilization of advanced technology and market-leading health analytics. A robust telehealth services suite developed through significant investments enables UNH to deliver virtual healthcare services effectively.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for UnitedHealth Group’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.97 per share, indicating a 12.5% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests 12.6% growth from the year-ago actual. UNH’s earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 4.04%. Its shares have gained 3.7% in the past three months.Price &amp; Consensus: UNHZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCigna: This Connecticut-based health insurer continues to benefit from the strength exhibited by its two growth platforms, namely Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare. While a solid specialty pharmacy services suite drives the growth of the Evernorth platform, the Cigna Healthcare unit benefits from a growing customer base within its U.S. Government and U.S. Commercial businesses. New collaborations or contract extensions with renowned healthcare systems strengthen the capabilities of the health insurer.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Cigna’s 2023 earnings is pegged at $24.81 per share, implying 6.6% growth from the prior-year reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests a 4.6% improvement from the year-ago actual. CI’s earnings outpaced estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 6.56%. Even though its shares have declined 3.8% in the past three months, solid fundamentals are likely to help shares bounce back in the days ahead.Price &amp; Consensus: CIZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHumana: Headquartered in Kentucky, Humana is driven by higher premiums and an expanding customer base across its Medicaid and Medicare businesses. The health insurer teams up with well-reputed organizations to launch new plans or upgrade features within the existing ones. The strength of such plans leads to numerous contract wins and renewed agreements for Humana from various federal or state authorities.

329,a1f65a00-cc24-3881-bda9-ee0ad3d9958c,SLG,2023-06-09,12 Best Short Squeeze Stocks to Buy Now,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-best-short-squeeze-stocks-120213885.html,1686312133.0,STORY,"['PLCE', 'CUTR', 'VTNR', 'CNK', 'ALLO', 'SLG', 'PLUG', 'TPIC', 'VERV']","[In this article we present the list of 12 Best Short Squeeze Stocks to Buy Now. Click to skip ahead and see the 5 Best Short Squeeze Stocks to Buy Now.Plug Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG), Cinemark Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CNK), and Allogene Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALLO) are some of the best short squeeze stocks to buy now based on their level of short interest as well as the conviction that world-class hedge funds have in their long-term prospects.In the winner-takes-all world of buying and selling stocks, there is a constant tug-of-war taking place between a stock’s bulls (who believe the stock’s price will go up) and its bears (who believe the price will go down). Sentiment and momentum can play huge roles in a stock’s price movements and the two sides are constant battling to get that momentum on their side.Given the role of sentiment and momentum in stock performance, short squeeze plays have become somewhat interrelated with meme stocks in that small groups of retail investors can help trigger bigger movements in a stock by collaborating to push it past certain resistance levels, after which the sky is the limit.The meme short squeezes on GameStop Corp. (NYSE: GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: AMC), which have been two of the most successful short squeezes in stock market history, were largely facilitated through social media investment platforms like Reddit. Thus, looking for the next short squeeze stock on Reddit is a viable option, which is why we covered the 10 Most-Shorted Stocks Reddit’s WallStreetBets Is Paying Attention To.When trying to find good short squeeze candidates, it’s not enough to simply identify the 15 Most Shorted Stocks Right Now on Wall Street, though that list certainly makes for a good starting point. One of the most important metrics to consider even above and beyond the short interest in a stock is the days it would take for the shorts to cover their positions.When that figure is low, the best short squeeze stocks to buy today may not have much long-term potential, as shorts can quickly cover their positions and get out of a stock before it runs up too high. On the other hand, when the days to cover starts passing five or even ten days, shorts can be in a world of hurt if a stock starts to rally, as there typically isn’t enough trading volume in the stock for all of them to cover their positions in a timely manner.Story continuesWhen stocks rally, the volume of shares trading hands tends to increase however, which does provide a window for shorts to get out, which is why the top short squeeze stocks to buy right now should all have a minimum of five or more days to cover. In that case, even should the daily volume on a stock double or triple, it could still take days for shorts to cover their positions.Given that, the following short squeeze stocks list features only stocks that have greater than 20% short interest, as well as a minimum of five days for shorts to cover their positions, which presents legitimate opportunities to catch shorts in a squeeze. These stocks are also fairly popular among hedge funds given their relatively small sizes, with at least 20 smart money managers being long each of them as of March 31, which speaks to their long-term growth potential.12 Best Short Squeeze Stocks to Buy NowUbjsP/Shutterstock.comOur MethodologyThe following list of the best short squeeze stocks to buy now, which feature stocks with a minimum 20% short interest and five days to cover, are ranked based on hedge fund sentiment. We follow a select group of hedge funds because Insider Monkey’s research has uncovered that their consensus stock picks can deliver outstanding returns.All hedge fund data is based on the exclusive group of 900+ funds tracked by Insider Monkey that filed 13Fs for the Q1 2023 reporting period.12 Best Short Squeeze Stocks to Buy Now12. The Children’s Place, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLCE)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 20 Short Interest: 30% Days to Cover: 5.6 Allogene Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALLO), Plug Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG), and Cinemark Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CNK) are three stocks with sky high short interest that hedge funds like. Another is The Children’s Place, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLCE), 30% of the shares of which are currently being sold short.Hedge fund ownership of The Children’s Place, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLCE) has been volatile for much of the past two years, falling by 38% in the second quarter of last year before jumping back up by 38% the following quarter. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management opened a new stake in PLCE during the first quarter, while Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management raised his modest stake by 595% to 126,452 shares.The Children’s Place, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLCE) was hit with bad news late last week when it was announced that the retailer of children’s clothing would be losing its place in the S&amp;P Small Cap 600, which is likely to out further selling pressure on the stock. UBS lowered its price target on PLCE to $20 from $40 near the end of May, noting that should the recession drag on, the company’s results could be hurt more than anticipated.11. SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE:SLG)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 21 Short Interest:  27.1% Days to Cover: 5.1 Balyasny’s fund also owns the largest stake in SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE:SLG) as of March 31, consisting of 1.14 million shares. Overall hedge fund sentiment towards the REIT remained flat during Q1 after rising slightly in 2022.SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE:SLG) primarily operates in New York City, where it focuses on the ownership and leasing of space in office buildings and shopping centers. In the first quarter, the company’s revenue grew to $224 million from $188 million a year earlier, though FFO declined to $1.53 from $1.65.The solid quarterly performance was enough for BMO Capital analyst John Kim to raise his price target on SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE:SLG) to $32 from $30, citing the company’s increased leasing activity. The analyst believes asset sales will be necessary to help the company refinance and pay down some of its debt, though none were announced during the latest quarter. He has an ‘Outperform’ rating on SLG shares.10. Cutera, Inc. (NASDAQ:CUTR)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 21 Short Interest: 29% Days to Cover: 5.5 Hedge fund ownership of Cutera, Inc. (NASDAQ:CUTR) doubled during 2020-2022, hitting a new high at the end of last year. However, several funds did sell off their CUTR positions in the first quarter of this year, contributing to a 25% decline in smart money ownership. Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Richard Driehaus’ Driehaus Capital were among the funds to unload their Cutera holdings during the quarter.Like The Children’s Place, Cutera, Inc. (NASDAQ:CUTR) has also lost its spot in the S&amp;P Small Cap 600 recently, being replaced by DISH Network Corporation (NASDAQ:DISH). The medical aesthetics company has also been embroiled in a dispute with J. Daniel Plants’ Voce Capital, which has 43% 13F exposure to the stock as of March 31.While the fund clearly believes in Cutera, Inc. (NASDAQ:CUTR)’s value proposition and has a seat on the company’s board (in fact, Plants is the board’s Executive Chairman), it’s also been dissatisfied with the board’s composition and actions. Ahead of a Special Meeting scheduled for June 9, members of the board struck a deal with two of the company’s largest shareholders which would give them control of the board in exchange for those Directors retaining their positions. Plants described their actions as self-interested and claimed they have repeatedly shirked their fiduciary duties, while the board claims Plants is the one unwilling to give up his seat and that he’s costing the company money.9. Vertex Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:VTNR)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 21 Short Interest: 29.5% Days to Cover: 6.7 Hedge funds were selling out of Vertex Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:VTNR), one of the 5 Most Shorted Oil Stocks in the world, throughout much of 2022, but that changed earlier this year. After closing the year down 63% from its 2022 high, several hedge funds liked the new entry point on VTNR shares, including the vaunted quant fund Two Sigma Advisors, managed by John Overdeck and David Siegel, which bought 25,900 shares.Vertex Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:VTNR)’s Mobile, Alabama refinery has been operating at expected levels recently, with throughput volumes of between 69,000 and 72,000 barrels per day and operating expenses of between $3.85 and $4.00 per barrel. The company also pushed forward the timeline for its planned renewable diesel project from Q2 to Q1, which it believes will boost efficiencies.TD Cowen has a ‘Market Perform’ rating and $8 price target on Vertex Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:VTNR), noting that its acquisition of the Mobile refinery from Shell last year has helped transform the company’s business. The firm expects Vertex’s earnings to improve in 2024 and to make further improvements in 2025.8. Verve Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VERV)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 21 Short Interest: 31.2% Days to Cover: 16.7 At 16.7 days to cover their positions based on Verve Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VERV)’s daily average trading volume, short sellers could be in big trouble if the gene editing biotech’s stock starts to rally. Among the best short squeeze stocks to buy now, Verve has also had some of the steadiest hedge fund ownership since hitting the market. It’s also got some big money managers backing it, including Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management.Verve Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VERV) is one of the earliest-stage CRISPR stocks on the market, which has attracted plenty of bears to bet against it given that some of the shine has come off CRISPR stocks in recent quarters due to some high-profile CRISPR trials producing underwhelming results.Verve Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VERV), which is targeting cardiovascular diseases through the gene-editing technology in combination with a non-viral delivery modality, could conservatively generate peak sales of $5 billion from its two lead programs according to Canaccord analyst Whitney Ijem, who has a ‘Buy’ rating and $29 price target on the stock.7. Stem, Inc. (NYSE:STEM)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 22 Short Interest: 23.2% Days to Cover: 5.8 Stem, Inc. (NYSE:STEM) shares are down by 70% since mid-September, when they were trading hands at over $16 each. For the most part, hedge funds are sticking with the company, which is not in fact a biotech as its name might suggest, but rather a smart energy optimization and storage company. In fact, the firm’s top shareholder, Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group, raised the size of its STEM position 10-fold during Q1 to 3.79 million shares.Stem, Inc. (NYSE:STEM)’s growth has been accelerating in recent quarters and the company’s bookings have been tremendous, more than doubling year-over-year in the both the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. Q1 revenue of $67.4 million easily topped estimates and the company’s margins were in line with estimates. Stem, Inc. (NYSE:STEM) also projects to be EBITDA profitable by the second half of this year.6. TPI Composites, Inc. (NASDAQ:TPIC)Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 22 Short Interest: 21.7% Days to Cover: 8 TPI Composites, Inc. (NASDAQ:TPIC) is another one of the Stocks Targeted By Short Sellers Recently. Given they’d need eight days to cover their short positions, they’re in a vulnerable position should a short squeeze opportunity present itself to the stock’s bulls. Among those bulls are Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management and Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group, both of which were buying more TPIC shares in Q1.TPI Composites, Inc. (NASDAQ:TPIC)’s core windmill blades business has been strong, growing revenue by more than 20% in Q1, which contributed to an overall revenue beat for the company. However, it lost $0.88 per share during the quarter and was forced to take on more debt.TPI Composites, Inc. (NASDAQ:TPIC)’s secondary business of building composite bodies for electric busses has been a disappointment and largely to blame for the company’s overall results, as Q1 sales slipped by 20%. The two businesses have also failed to produce cost efficiencies as they’ve scaled up, severely impacting their profitability. Cinemark Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:CNK), Allogene Therapeutics, Inc. (NASDAQ:ALLO), and Plug Power, Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG) are three of hedge funds’ favorite stocks that are being targeted by short sellers, which could present some great short squeeze opportunities in the future.

Horton’s strong cash position and low debt/capital ratio allowed it to make strategic land purchases even during the downturn, in turn, giving it a significant competitive advantage. The company has selectively invested in attractively-priced land and lots in the past few years allowing it to bring new attractive communities in desirable markets. For the first and second quarters of fiscal 2023, the company invested $900 million and $980 million in finished lots, $690 million and $590 million in land development, and $130 million and $150 million in acquiring land, respectively.Profit From Entry-Level Homes: D.R.

First-time homebuyers represented 55% of its closings in second-quarter fiscal 2023.High-Return Strategies: DHI strategically manages pricing, incentives and sales pace across its markets in a manner that will optimize the returns on inventory investments. It believes a consistent sales pace through inventory turnover is the best way to maximize profits and returns.

332,79cbe9eb-13a9-35da-93a3-9dbdd3979646,DHI,2023-06-09,Why homebuilder stocks may be able to go even higher,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/homebuilder-stocks-move-higher-161046085.html,1686240646,VIDEO,"['TPH', 'PHM', 'MTH', 'LEN', 'LEN-B', 'TOL', 'NVR', 'DHI']","[Homebuilder stocks have surged lately, and according to one Deutsche Bank analyst, they may have even more room to run. Yahoo Finance's Dani Romero takes a look at the winners and losers among homebuilder stocks.Video Transcript[AUDIO LOGO]RACHELLE AKUFFO: A string of strong earnings from homebuilders has powered impressive stock gains, further fueling an upbeat sentiment from Deutsche Bank analysts amid weaker housing demand. ""Yahoo Finance's"" Dani Romero joins us with Deutsche Bank's take on the winners and losers from the homebuilder stocks. Hey, Danny.DANI ROMERO: Hi, Rachelle. Well, the big hype around homebuilder stocks, it's not going anywhere. These stocks are going up. One Deutsche Bank-- one analyst, excuse me, from Deutsche Bank says, the winning streak isn't over just yet.And the reason-- why are these big gains happening? Well, builders are price-takers. So they have been slashing home prices to drive up demand. And not only that, but they've also been offering incentives, which include rate buy-downs. And that looks really attractive when mortgage rates are above 6%.So which ones are the winners and the losers? Well, let's start with the winners. These-- the reason that they are the winners is because these homebuilders have been trying different strategies to build up demand. So let's start with D.R. Horton. We have D.R. Horton, Meritage, Pulte Homes, Tri Pointe, and Toll Brothers.For example, Toll Brothers. OK. They have shifted to affordable luxury. And not only that, but they have also ramped up their spec starts. So that means that unsold homes that have at least a foundation in the ground.Pulte Group also follow suit and increasing their spec starts as well. And then if we look at Tri Pointe, the reason that's also been a big gainer is that they have expanded their footprint to Texas, the Carolinas, and potentially, Florida. So there could be some return on investment there.Now let's move over to the losers. We've got NVR. We got Lennar. And the reason is because Deutsche Bank says that Lennar-- excuse me, NVRs management is letting cash pile up on their balance sheet. So there's a little bit of this somewhat detachment there.Story continuesFor Lennar, the analysts believe that it will underperform compared to their peers like D.R. Horton. There are still two stocks that are on-- that have hold ratings, that is Taylor Morrison and KB Homes. And the reason is Taylor Morrison could face some pressure due to higher leverage, also some unfavorable business mix there too.But again, KB Homes could also underperform compared to their peers D.R. Horton and Meritage. Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: So Dani, for people who are looking at these homebuilder stocks, wondering if they should get into them, are there any risks ahead that they should be aware of?DANI ROMERO: Rachelle, so if the US does tip into a recession, that could lead to job losses, and that could weaken demand. So that's just to give you some context. So on a company basis.So if there could be some risks. Let's go into, for example, D.R. Horton. There could be some impacts there. The company has expanded their footprint in Texas. So that market could face some uncertainty if we do tip into a recession.And for Toll Brothers. They have concentrated a lot on luxury. Yes, they've moved into affordable luxury but there could be some downturn there. But again, the story here in housing will be the tug-of-war between affordability and inventory, Rachelle.RACHELLE AKUFFO: Well, certainly, as you laid out that not all homebuilders are created equal, everyone has to do their homework there. Thank you for laying that out for us. Our very own Dani Romero, thanks so much.]"
333,5562bb66-86d6-3e91-8937-9a36dc0899eb,DHI,2023-06-09,What Makes D.R. Horton (DHI) a Strong Momentum Stock: Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/makes-d-r-horton-dhi-160007496.html,1686240007,STORY,['DHI'],"[Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at D.R. Horton (DHI), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. D.R. Horton currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for DHI that show why this homebuilder shows promise as a solid momentum pick.Looking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.For DHI, shares are up 4.98% over the past week while the Zacks Building Products - Home Builders industry is up 3.4% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 4.76% compares favorably with the industry's 5.95% performance as well.Story continuesConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of D.R. Horton have risen 18.35%, and are up 56.1% in the last year. In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 7.51% and 4.23%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to DHI's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. DHI is currently averaging 2,547,919 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with DHI.Over the past two months, 16 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost DHI's consensus estimate, increasing from $9.08 to $11.25 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 14 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineTaking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that DHI is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of A. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep D.R. Horton on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

However, escalating operating costs and low liquidity are worrisome.Factors Favoring AALOwing to upbeat air-travel demand, operating revenues in first-quarter 2023 increased 37% year over year. Passenger revenues, accounting for the bulk of the top line (91.1%), increased to $11,103 million from $7,818 million a year ago.The anticipated air-travel-demand swell during the summer season and low fuel costs led to the recently issued bullish outlook for second-quarter 2023.American Airlines, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), now expects total revenue per available seat miles (a measure of unit revenue) to decline 1-3% from second-quarter 2022 actuals (earlier estimate: a decline of 2-4%). Adjusted operating margin is now anticipated in the 12.5-14.5% band (earlier guidance: 11-13%). Average fuel cost per gallon is now expected in the range of $2.55-$2.65 (prior guidance: $2.65-$2.75).Available seat miles (a measure of capacity) are still estimated to increase 3.5-5.5% year over year. AAL projects earnings per share (excluding net special items) in the $1.45-$1.65 range (prior view: $1.20-$1.40).Backed by robust air-travel demand, American Airlines is constantly looking to add routes and broaden network. The carrier's debt-reduction efforts are impressive as well. Management aims to reduce its debt by $15 billion by 2025 end.Key RisksDespite declining fuel costs, expenses on labor continue to be high. AAL expects non-fuel unit costs to increase 3.5-5.5% year over year in second-quarter 2023. AAL continues to grapple with pilot shortage in the face of a strong rebound in air-travel demand.American Airlines’ current ratio (a measure of liquidity) at the end of first-quarter 2023 was 0.72. A current ratio of less than 1 is not desirable as it implies that the company doesn't have enough liquid assets to cover its short-term liabilities.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks for investors interested in the Zacks Airline industry are Copa Holdings CPA and Allegiant Travel Company ALGT. Each stocks is currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Copa Holdings is benefiting from an improvement in air-travel demand.

In first-quarter 2023, cargo and mail revenues grew 51.8% from first-quarter 2019 levels on higher cargo volumes and yields.Copa Holdings' fleet modernization and cost-management efforts are commendable. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has been revised 21.05% upward over the past 60 days.Allegiant is seeing a steady recovery in air-travel demand. In first-quarter 2023, operating revenues grew 29.9% on a year-over-year basis.

The Labor Department stated that employers added 339,000 new jobs in May, much higher than expected. Moreover, U.S. regional bank stocks are also moving north owing to expectations of a pause in interest rate hikes.Investors would do well to take advantage of the rosy scenario by focusing on broker-favorite stocks like American Airlines AAL, Bread Financial BFH, American Axle &amp; Manufacturing Holdings AXL, Boise Cascade Company BCC and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch ANF.Here’s Why Broker-Advice Needs to be FollowedBrokers, irrespective of their types (sell-side, buy-side or independent), have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors. They go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations.As brokers often directly communicate with the top brass, they gain an in-depth understanding of what is happening in a particular company. Therefore, the question of their action being arbitrary does not arise. In fact, a rating upgrade or downgrade by brokers has the potential to influence the price of the stock.A rating upgrade often leads to stock price appreciation. Similarly, the price of a stock may plummet following a rating downgrade. In view of the above attributes, broker action should be relied on by individual investors, in their quest to form a winning portfolio of stocks.Formulating a Winning PortfolioWe have designed a screener to arrive at stocks based on improving analyst recommendation and upward earnings estimate revisions over the last four weeks. However, considering only these factors does not make our strategy foolproof as the top line has not been considered.Story continuesActually, according to many market watchers, a top-line outperformance is more creditable for a company than a mere earnings outperformance. To address top-line concerns, we have included the price/sales ratio in our screener which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric.Screening Criteria# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75(This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks).% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10(This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter).We have also added the following screening parameters to ensure that the strategy is a winning one:Price-to-Sales = Bot%10(The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio).Price greater than 5(as a stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most of the investors).Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days(Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded).Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000(This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 in terms of market capitalization).Com/ADR/Canadian= Com(This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks).Here are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL.

American Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Bread Financial, based in Columbus, OH, continues to benefit from data-driven marketing strategies.

Bread Financial currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.American Axle’s significant strides and collaborations in the electric drive space bode well for its top- and bottom- line growth.

That is because the Jan 19, 2024 $90.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Quest Diagnostics shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Quest Diagnostics is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Medical - Outpatient and Home Healthcare industry that ranks in the Bottom 23% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while four have revised the estimates downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $2.25 per share to $2.26 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Quest Diagnostics right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

(CSCO) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cisco-systems-inc-csco-attracting-130011148.html,1686229211,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Cisco Systems (CSCO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this seller of routers, switches, software and services have returned +6.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +3.4% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Networking industry, which Cisco falls in, has gained 7.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Cisco is expected to post earnings of $1.06 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.7%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.81 points to a change of +13.4% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.2%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.04 indicates a change of +6.2% from what Cisco is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Cisco is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPSProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Cisco, the consensus sales estimate of $15.05 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +14.8%. The $56.84 billion and $58.3 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +10.3% and +2.6%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryCisco reported revenues of $14.57 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.5%. EPS of $1 for the same period compares with $0.87 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.39 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.27%. The EPS surprise was +3.09%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Cisco is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Cisco. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

350,e97891c0-139f-3025-87e5-cc8cb2aee128,CSCO,2023-06-09,Sustainability and Co-Innovation: Shared Passions of Enel and Cisco CDA,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sustainability-co-innovation-shared-passions-123000123.html,1686227400,STORY,"['CSCO', 'ENEL.MI']","[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / June 8, 2023 / Cisco Systems Inc.Cisco Systems Inc., Thursday, June 8, 2023, Press release pictureThis blog was co-authored by Sophia Filipe, Country Digitization Program Manager, within the Cisco Country Digital Acceleration (CDA) program. This is the second in a series of blogs on CDA Sustainability Projects that go behind the scenes of the sustainability projects we are engaged in, and the impact we are having through Cisco's CDA program.Enel Group, a global Italian power utility, have constantly embraced new technologies to make energy more reliable, more affordable, and more sustainable, from the introduction of the first smart meter to becoming the world's largest producer of renewable energy. Through a Cisco CDA investment, Cisco has partnered with Enel to co-innovate on digital solutions and support energy decarbonization, digitization and decentralization.Innovation and sustainability are of great importance to both companies, and Enel and Cisco are eager to collaborate on digitizing critical infrastructure and support progress towards global net zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions ambitions.We sat down with members of Cisco's Enel team, Giovanni Colombo, systems architect, and Federica Ingrao, account manager, to hear their perspective on sustainability and the outcomes this unique partnership can drive.It is critical to address climate change now. Why is it important to Enel and to you?Federica: My personal commitment to sustainability goes back to growing up in Sicily, Italy. The ecology and history of Sicily is strongly connected to sustainability. Its culture and economy have a deep connection to nature. For me, it is important to work for a company that values the environment. Sustainability is an integral part of Cisco´s purpose to Power an Inclusive Future for All, and this makes me feel that I'm contributing to these efforts as well.Giovanni: I think every day about our ability to support a healthy planet for all. That is why we are striving to align Cisco and customer's goals. With the co-innovation program we have in place with Enel, we are supporting this alignment. Enel is one of the world's biggest power utilities in energy generation, distribution and supply, and number one in the world for installed capacity of renewable energy. Working together, we can contribute to protect natural resources, accelerate the renewable energy transition, and help reverse the impact of climate change.Story continuesHow is Cisco co-innovating with Enel, and why does this matter?Giovanni: While Cisco and Enel have worked together for many years, we expanded the relationship in 2017 by signing a co-innovation agreement. Under that agreement, Cisco became Enel's Global Technology Partner to develop innovative solutions for electricity grids, to promote and spread Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technologies, to enhance cybersecurity processes, and to scout for co-innovation solutions based on Open Innovation. Our companies are now working together to define, design, test and deploy digital architectures.We have three pillars that guide our co-innovation:First is digitizing and improving the operational efficiency of the grid. Cisco technology can enable the grid to have capabilities like real-time remote monitoring of consumption levels and grid function, and automated self-healing. These capabilities allow Enel to restore grid faults remotely and automatically reduce wasteful interruption, and support Enel's overall emissions reduction in Operation and Maintenance (OM) activities - all of which can have positive impact for local communities.Second is a unified convergent IT/OT network designed with circularity in mind. Cisco and Enel designed Enel's network to save power, space, and maintenance to reduce carbon emissions. The design includes digitized electrical infrastructure, interconnecting tens of thousands of substations and introducing an IoT distributed sensor system for real-time maintenance of the grid's primary substations. This advanced network approach at Enel's large scale significantly contributes to better use of limited natural resources.The third pillar is the ability to increase Enel's renewable energy hosting capacity. Through projects co-designed with Cisco, Enel strives to deliver gigawatts of renewable energy hosting capacity. When we say renewable energy, we mean distributed solar, wind, hydro and geothermal energy sources that need to be connected to the grid, supporting operational security and allowing voltage and power flow control in a smart grid architecture.How can this partnership help Cisco Enel progress towards joint and individual sustainability goals?Federica: One way we see Cisco supporting Enel is through sharing information, best practices and helping them achieve sustainability goals.Giovanni: Another interesting point of the co-innovation agreement is skills exchange. We had several meetings and trainings where we gained vertical knowledge of the electrical grid from Enel, and we in turn shared our knowledge about the IT network for digital smartgrids. The co-education pillar has been one of the most successful outcomes.Moving forward, how do Cisco Enel plan to leverage innovation for greater sustainability impact?Federica: For the Cisco Enel team, innovation is a key part of supporting sustainability. If we look at companies such as Enel, they can support economic profit and sustainability in the countries in which they operate. Innovation and sustainability go hand-in-hand.Giovanni: Enel launched, and now partially owns, a new company called Gridspertise. Gridspertise partners with Distribution System Operators (DSOs) around the world to upgrade their distribution systems by adding intelligence and preparing them for the future. Their mission is to deliver a new era of sustainable and reliable smart grids through innovative, flexible and customer-driven digital solutions that are circular by design. With support from its trusted partnership with Cisco, Gridspertise is making strides in advancing sustainability and novel solutions to the external power utility marketGrid operators like Enel need to move energy to turn the lights on for the world, and an ‘always on' Industrial IoT network helps support that mission. We are eager to see Cisco and Enel's co-innovation efforts grow and continue advancing digitization of the utilities market and sustainability.View original content hereView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-incEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/760049/Sustainability-and-Co-Innovation-Shared-Passions-of-Enel-and-Cisco-CDA]"
