1,16897347-6063-3ce0-9eeb-351f66507677,QRVO,2022-12-25,"What Is Qorvo, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:QRVO) Share Price Doing?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/qorvo-inc-nasdaq-qrvo-share-142300752.html,1671891780,STORY,['QRVO'],"[Qorvo, Inc. (NASDAQ:QRVO), might not be a large cap stock, but it saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Qorvo’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. View our latest analysis for Qorvo What Is Qorvo Worth?According to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average, the stock price seems to be justfied. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 13.38x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 15.68x, which means if you buy Qorvo today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that Qorvo should be trading at this level in the long run, then there’s not much of an upside to gain over and above other industry peers. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because Qorvo’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company’s shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.Can we expect growth from Qorvo?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 12% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Qorvo. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in QRVO’s positive outlook, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at QRVO? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on QRVO, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for QRVO, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Qorvo as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

2,a83fcf49-8aff-36c1-8077-06b58538c79e,WMT,2022-12-25,15 Most Hated Companies in America,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-hated-companies-america-230921187.html,1671923361,STORY,"['NFLX', 'BP', 'AMZN', 'CMCSA', 'FOXA', 'XOM', 'JNJ', 'AIG', 'WMT', 'UBER']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 most hated companies in America. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most hated companies in America.In an ideal world, companies would be supported by the general population. After all, the economy of a country defines its standard of living, and the economy of a country is propped up by the major industries in the nation. And these industries are defined by the companies within each industry. After all, companies provide innovation, ideas and solutions that people need. If they didn't, they would soon be out of business. They also provide employment to the working force of a country. So why is it that most people hate corporations?Many corporations in the world, and especially the bigger ones, are disliked strongly by the general population because people believe that these companies exist for one purpose and one purpose alone: to maximize profits no matter what the cost. Even though these companies earn billions of dollars in profits each year, people believe that they do not contribute in any positive way and continue to cut costs in order to increase profit even more. This ends up benefiting only a select few such as the executives of the company and shareholders. Meanwhile, employees are sometimes overworked and underpaid, not to mention made to work in harsh conditions. Many people also hate corporations because they believe that such companies take from the country but do not provide much in return and so, they are actually a detriment.15 most hated companies in AmericaStock-Asso/Shutterstock.comYou might think that this hatred would translate to a negative impact on the company's financials and hence, its success but the discussion isn't as straightforward as you might believe. Some of the most successful companies in the world are also among the most hated primarily because of their success, and yet they do genuinely make the life of customers easier. For example, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been derided time and again for its treatment of workers, and considering the fact that there are 1.5 million workers in the company, this is an important fact to consider. However, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has made the life of consumers really easy, providing instant delivery or next-day delivery in many cases while also providing the cheapest price possible for many products, excellent customer service and a great return policy. When the lives of people are made easier, they often compromise on their beliefs.Story continuesAnother reason behind companies not suffering despite widespread hatred is because there aren't many alternatives. Take the U.S. for example. While there are anti-trust laws established to ensure competition, and there are many examples of mergers not being allowed to avoid monopolies, with the attempted merger of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) being a recent example, there are effective monopolies in some industries which has led to them being the only possible solution, no matter how poor their customer service is or no matter how many outrageous fees they tack on. Some of these companies are part of the most hated countries in America and we will discuss them in greater detail later on.It is interesting to note that just because a company is among our list of the most hated companies in America, it doesn't mean that it's universally hated. After all, maybe 10% of the population hates a specific company but maybe 30% of the population loves it. Since we're only focusing on the former criteria, it would feature in our list even though more people love it than hate it and so, being in this list doesn't mean that the company is doomed. Take Meta Platforms Inc. (META) for example. It is hated by a ton of people due to privacy concerns, data leaks and its influence on everyone, but it still has 2 billion active monthly users, and so, is nowhere near finished. Meanwhile, financial corporations such as The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is hated by most of the public but the company mainly deals with other companies and wealthy clients so public perception doesn't really hurt its bottom line. For companies which operate on a B2B model (business to business), public perception doesn't matter as much as for B2C companies (business to consumer).Of course, this doesn't mean that there are no repercussions to a company if they fail the general public. Nowadays, profits and revenue alone aren't sufficient to determine the success of the company: Environmental, social and governance (ESG) is just as important and is the biggest challenge for companies to overcome if they want to continue the level of success that they've enjoyed, or even increase it. According to PwC, itself one of the largest firms in the world, mentioned that social capital is incredibly relevant to the success of a business now. Social capital refers to the impact of the decisions taken by a business on people. According to PwC, it ""describes the stocks of knowledge, skills, experience, health and wellbeing within people; as well as the stocks of relationships, institutions, shared values and norms that exist between people. Just like other forms of capital, social capital can be increased or decreased by the ‘flows’ of social capital - the social impacts - which result from business activity."" If a business operates properly with the general well-being of society being a primary focus, it will achieve success quickly. Of course, this always has to be balanced with revenue and profitability, but the point is that both need to go hand in hand for a business to be truly successful.Speaking of audit firms, the audit industry has seen its fair share of criticism too, especially in recent year. There have been a series of high-profile failures in audit which has put the industry under scrutiny, with record fines administered to some audit firms which has resulted in the Financial Reporting Council in the United Kingdom to announce plans to overhaul corporate governance. Audit firms also see heavy workload with tight deadlines and often do not have adequate staff, resulting in high pressure for employees which in turn results in a high level of turnover, all of which are detrimental to the health of an employee as well as impacting their performance. This is a trend in audit firms throughout the world and audit firms, while taking steps in some countries, should ensure more global policies to create a proper work-life for employees.You can also consider the pharmaceutical industry as an entire industry which is disliked by the general public. Conspiracy theorists have come up with the term ""Big Pharma"" which refers to major pharmaceutical organizations with conspiracy theories alleging that the executives of these companies collude to keep medical breakthroughs from reaching the public while also citing price hikes as a way for companies to make even higher profits at the expense of the health of the general public. This reputation has seen a massive improvement in recent years as these companies worked hard to come up with a vaccine for the worst pandemic in a century, helping to avert millions of deaths and tens of millions of serious illnesses across the world.For our rankings of the most hated companies, we polled the rankings published by various other websites including 24/7 Wall Street, TheStreet.com, Bloomberg, Business Insider and Fast Company, giving precedence to companies which made multiple lists. Basically, our article reflects the approximate consensus opinion of the financial media. Some of these rankings are as old as 10 years as we intentionally picked rankings that span a long period of time. This way we are more likely to identify the companies that are consistently out of favor with the general public and the media. So now, let's take a look at the most hated companies in the America, companies which need to work hard to regain public trust, starting with number 15:15. American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG)American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) earned the ire of the general public when normal people lost their life savings and employment in the 2008 recession, while it was bailed out by the Federal Government to the tune of $180 billion and announced payments of $165 million in executive bonuses alone. In a display of rare unity, both Democrats and Republicans voiced their anger at this announcement by American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG), with even President Obama commenting on whether such a bonus was deserved at all.14. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of times mentioned: 2Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue but has faced significant controversy regarding its operations. While Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) received praised in 1982 for a nationwide recall of Tylenol after some packages of the drug had been laced with cyanide, it has garnered significant criticism based on lawsuits that its baby powder causes ovarian cancer, with damages in billions of dollars being decided against the company.13. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX)Number of times mentioned: 2Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) owns Fox News, which is the main basis for the hatred it receives. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) is criticized for only providing views sympathetic to the Republican party, and the bias present in its coverage. We believe this is a brilliant business strategy as most of the media companies stand to the left of the political spectrum.12. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of times mentioned: 2Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been a people favorite for a long time, growing massively over a short period of time. However, hatred for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has started to increase mainly because of price increases and the company pledging to crack down on multiple people using the same account. We don't think Netflix's presence in our list of the most hated companies in the US points to a negative outcome for the company or its shareholders.11. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of times mentioned: 2The ride-hailing company has over 122 million monthly users, but it has received criticism for its treatment of its drivers as gig workers. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is also disliked because of its disruption of the taxicab industry and contribution in traffic congestion. We don't think UBER deserves to be one of the ""most hated companies"" as its services addressed a massive problem for consumers who have trouble hailing a cab and getting almost anything to be delivered to their doors. UBER will probably find itself a place in an extended version of our ""most innovative companies"" article.10. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Number of times mentioned: 2Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is widely criticized for its monopoly in many areas where alternates aren't present and the difficulty customers face if they want to cancel the service. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is also derided for extremely poor customer service. The Consumerist dubbed Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) the worst company in America in 2010 and 2014.9. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of times mentioned: 2Our list could've consisted entirely of oil companies, considering how maligned they are in the eyes of the public but we settled for just two. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been accused of being aware of the contribution of fossil fuels to climate change but provided false information to investors to prop up its share price. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was also accused of hiring military units of the Indonesian National Army to provide protection to the company's assets in the country, with these units being accused of human rights violations. Exxon Mobil is also still remembered because of the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster.Overall, though, we don't think XOM's presence in the ""most hated companies"" lists affects its business materially as consumers don't really prefer one oil company over another.8. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of times mentioned: 2One of the largest banking institutions in America, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was accused of misrepresenting its exposure to Enron after the collapse of the latter. Further, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) paid $75 million in 2010 after charges were brought against the company stating that investors were misled with respect to potential losses arising from risky mortgages. Yes, we know, it is a tiny fine. Regulators fixed their mistake in 2014 as the bank agreed to pay $7 billion to resolve a Department of Justice investigation into its sale of toxic mortgage-backed securities leading up to the financial crisis.In 2018, Citigroup also agreed to pay $1 billion to settle charges brought by the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve that it had violated the Bank Secrecy Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by failing to properly monitor transactions that potentially violated U.S. sanctions.7. BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP)Number of times mentioned: 2BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) is one of the biggest oil companies in the world, and in 2010, was responsible for the worst oil spill in global history in what is now known as the Deepwater Horizon Spill. While the spill ended up costing BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) around $65 billion, this has led to the general public hating the company. The oil spill disaster affected BP's business for a few years, but we don't think it is material anymore.6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of times mentioned: 2Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is the largest private employer in the world with over 2 million employees, most of whom are being accused of being treated unfairly by the largest company in the world by revenue. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is also disliked because in many places, it has swooped in and destroyed local businesses, leaving customers no other options. That's a consequence of the success of its business model. Consumers love Walmart and prefer to shop there, just like they love Amazon.com (AMZN) even though Amazon drove several competitors out of business.Click to continue reading and see the 5 most hated companies in America. Suggested articles:15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks to Buy10 Best ASX Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 15 most hated companies in America is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

Following the 50 basis point rate hike in Dec., there are expectations that Feb. and March will see 25 basis point rate hikes, respectively. That will bring target rates near 5% which is where investors should expect them to remain throughout 2023. In short, investors should expect 2023 to look and feel like 2022 in many ways. However, there are still a good deal of hot stocks to buy. Just prepare to invest accordingly. That isn’t meant to be gloomy. Growth still exists in several areas. ARRYArray Technologies$21.53ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$94.27KYMRKymera Therapeutics$27.52MRKMerck$111.11AMDAdvanced Micro Devices$67.68HBANHuntington Bancshares$14.00PRGOPerrigo Co.$31.80Stocks to Buy: Array Technologies (ARRY)Solar penny stocks: a close up of a solar cell farmSource: Fit Ztudio / ShutterstockArray Technologies (NASDAQ:ARRY) stock should have a strong 2023 because of its exposure to solar. At the moment, the company manufactures ground-mounting systems used in solar arrays. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPlus, there are several reasons to believe 2023 will continue to be kind to the stock. For one, solar is expected to be the fastest-growing subsegment in energy in 2023 with demand spiking 20-30%. Array Technologies will also benefit from domestic content requirements in the Inflation Reduction Act. Those requirements will preference the company’s made in the U.S.A components, giving it a boost.In addition, Array Technologies’ business is booming. It reported record revenues of $515 million in its third quarter. That was a drastic improvement over the $188.6 million of revenues it posted year over year. The company is also reporting net income now after reporting losses in 2021. It’s difficult to find a serious issue that would indicate ARRY stock isn’t investment worthy. Stocks to Buy: Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)Tractor spraying pesticides on soybean field with sprayerSource: ShutterstockStory continuesArcher-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) stock is expected to have another exemplary year in 2023. At the moment, the consensus of the Wall Street analysts covering stock said it could trade at $101 within the next 12 to 18 months. Others suggest that it could run to $110 within a year. Investors should also note the company has paid a dividend without reduction since 1976. That dividend yields a modest 1.7% which increases overall returns.  Archer-Daniels-Midland sells oilseeds, corn, and wheat, and serves various end markets through its nutrition segment. It should continue to do well in 2023 as the war in Ukraine continues to disrupt global agriculture overall. That strong momentum is reflected in the company’s most recent earnings which include profits that increased by 55.9% during the period.Stocks to Buy: Kymera Therapeutics (KYMR)Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocksSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.comKymera Therapeutics (NASDAQ:KYMR) is another hot stock to buy as we near 2023. The company’s pipeline of anti-inflammatory and oncology treatments continues to move toward commercialization. Better, analysts say the KYMR stock could more than double in the next 12 to 18 months, depending on the progress of its pipeline.  One of the primary reasons to remain optimistic about Kymera Therapeutics is that it sits at the forefront of the targeted protein degradation field. The company was founded around protein degradation which it believes can serve as a basis for an entire class of future drugs. The firm also believes it recently demonstrated, for the first time, a clinically significant impact of a protein degrader outside of oncology. The company also boasts a cohort of protein degraders within the oncology field. It will share relevant clinical data around those drugs in 2023 which, if positive, will serve to potentially double its price. Merck (MRK)medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stockSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.comMerck (NYSE:MRK) also makes our list of top stocks to buy for 2023. Most impressive, company sales increased 14% in its third quarter year over year. Further, through the first nine months of 2022, Merck’s sales jumped 29%, from $35.2 billion to $45.45 billion. MRK also carries a dividend yield of 2.63% at the moment, making it even more attractive.In addition, the MRK stock has a beta of 0.41. That means it is only 41% as volatile as the prevailing markets over the past 5 years. That should continue to be a strong point of attraction as a recession is expected beginning in late 2023. Two, it has a strong tailwind in that its immunotherapy has shown to be effective when taken in conjunction with Moderna’s (NASDAQ:MRNA) mRNA cancer vaccine. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock precipitously in 2022. It currently trades near $67 at the time of writing after being nearly halved.  Fed interest rates will probably stay around 5% throughout 2023. In addition, It is expected that AMD will see an annual 28% earnings increase over the next 3 to 5 years. Investors won’t ignore that forever. So money invested in AMD stock now is very likely to appreciate in value quickly. Analysts seem to like the AMD stock, too. UBS upgraded AMD to a buy rating, with a price target of $95 a share.  Baird analyst Tristan Gerra also just upgraded the AMD stock to outperform with a price target of $100, believing the company’s newest Genoa chips could widen the company’s competitive moat.“Genoa’s very significant performance step up should translate into an acceleration in market share gains for AMD in 2023, along with significantly higher pricing and a higher gross margin profile, reinforcing AMD’s EPYC performance leadership for years to come,” as noted by Yahoo Finance.Huntington Bancshares (HBAN)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) stock should continue to do well in New Year 2023.  The Ohio-based commercial and consumer bank increased its prime rate to 7.5% on Dec. 15. That is a very solid indication that it should continue to see rapidly growing interest income into 2023. Essentially, Huntington Bancshares will charge more interest to its customers and therefore receive a greater amount of interest income. The company had already raised its prime rate to 7% in Nov. What’s interesting is that all of the effects of those rising rates will be reflected in fourth quarter earnings. That follows an already strong third quarter earnings report in which interest income increased 11%, reaching $143 million. In short, investors can expect already strong revenues to get even stronger for the company. On top of that, Huntington Bancshares includes a dividend yielding 4.58% that can be used to increase gains through reinvestment. Perrigo (PRGO)Perrigo (NYSE:PRGO) is another one of the hot stocks to buy in 2023 . The company owns HRA Pharma which submitted an application for an over-the-counter (OTC) birth control pill back in July. That submission occurred just after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe. v Wade. If its submission is successful, Perrigo will be the company with the first OTC birth control pill in the U.S. Perrigo is a French company that continues to grow. Sales reached $1.1 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.04 billion a year prior. Sales also increased 8.67% through the first nine months of 2022, reaching $3.296 billion. Yet, at the same time, Perrigo is facing increasing costs leading to higher operating expenses. That has resulted in increasing net losses through Q3 ‘22 that swelled from $78.5 million to $116.9 million. Losses should get better in 2023 as the effects of rate increases work through the economy. In any case, potential OTC approval makes Perrigo worth buying as we move into the new year.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

For more countries, head on over to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Africa. Africa is one of the richest continents in the world when it comes to natural resources. The continent has vast resources of valuable metals such as cobalt, gold, platinum, and coltan. However, at the same time, it is also one of the least developed regions in the world, as years of colonialism, strife, political uncertainty, and conflicts have hampered the continent with the world's youngest population from growing.However, Africa's young population and the continent's mineral resources are crucial to unlocking growth in the region. This is due to the fact that there is strong potential for several industries in Africa to grow in order for the continent to wean off from exports and produce its own food. For instance, research from the Brookings Institution highlights that Africa has one of the strongest consumer goods industries in the world. This growth, as of 2018, had ended up outpacing the overall African gross domestic product (GDP) growth, as consumer expenditure grew by a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.9% between 2010 and 2015 as it touched $1.4 trillion.This growth won't stop there, as, by 2025 and 2030, the expenditure is slated to grow to $2.1 trillion and $2.5 trillion, respectively. Most of Africa's consumer goods companies are located in South Africa with some present in Nigeria as well. Notable examples are Tiger Brands Limited (JSE:TBS.JO), RCL Foods Limited (JSE:RCL.JO), and Flour Mills Nigeria (NGX:FLOURMILL).Another key African growth industry is agriculture. According to Oxford Business Group, the majority of the African population is employed in agriculture, and the sector's massive potential is simply evident in the fact that 60% of the world's uncultivated arable land is in Africa. To capitalize on this growth, agriculture technology companies are also growing in Africa, with estimates suggesting that for the first half of this year, African Agri tech startups received $95 million in funding - which marked a 58% annual growth. These startups are using a host of different technologies to stimulate the African agricultural sector, to enable farmers to easily access finance, conduct data analysis, secure their inputs at the right time and the right price, access the right markets, and use global best practices in their plantations.Story continuesSome great African agricultural startups are AgriProtein, which transforms organic waste into animal feed; Releaf, which connects farmers with large companies; Cowtribe, which delivers livestock vaccines to farmers using last mile delivery; and Hello Tractor, which uses the Internet of Things (IoT) digital monitors on trucks that allows tractor owners to provide their equipment to farmers.Finally, the growth in the African population will naturally lead to more users requiring access to communications services. For instance, a research report from Mordor Intelligence estimates that the African telecommunications market will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.2% between 2021 and 2026. It estimates that close to 300 million Africans use a mobile phone, with the market generating $90 billion in annual revenue.Sub-Saharan Africa is witnessing aggressive infrastructure rollout as well, as 3G coverage stood at 70% in 2018. The use of telecommunications is not only for entertainment purposes, but it also allows farmers to pick out the right markets for their produce and for people in general to access better healthcare. Some of the largest Africa-based telecommunications companies are MTN Group Limited (JSE:MTN.JO), Safaricom PLC (NSE:SCOM.NR), and Ethio telecom.most advanced countries in AfricaPhoto by Jacques Nel on UnsplashOur MethodologyWe consulted the World Intellectual Property Organization's (WIPO) Global Innovation Index to sift out which countries in Africa are the most advanced ones out of the 56 sovereign states that are members of the U.N. While other metrics, such as the OECD's patent database and the percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) spent on research and development, were initially considered, they were found lacking either in their scope (few African countries have patents to their name) or incomprehensive and out of date due to a lack of availability of the latest statistics. 12 Most Advanced Countries in Africa12. Republic of Côte d'IvoireGlobal Innovation Index (2022) Ranking: 109The Republic of Côte d'Ivoire is a West African country with a $173 billion GDP in terms of purchasing power parity. The economy relies primarily on agriculture, and the country exports different products such as cocoa beans, gold, and petroleum products. It is ranked 109 on the Global Innovation Index, making it relatively better off than some other countries such as Eswatini which still primarily rely on tribal systems. Additionally, the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire also ranks in the second percentile of countries when it comes to infrastructure, business sophistication, and institutions.11. Republic of ZimbabweGlobal Innovation Index (2022) Ranking: 107The Republic of Zimbabwe is a landlocked South African country with a $38 billion GDP. Its economy is primarily fueled by the services sector, due to low levels of industrialization. Additionally, Zimbabwe also has the world's second largest informal economy according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). These are economies that remain undocumented as their transactions are generally conducted outside the formal banking system, which keeps them off of the authorities' radar. Zimbabwe is also rich in natural resources such as gold, coal, and iron ore.10. United Republic of TanzaniaGlobal Innovation Index (2022) Ranking: 103The United Republic of Tanzania is an East African nation with a considerably large economy that is worth $207 billion. In nominal terms, Tanzania is the seventh largest GDP on its continent. Mining is an important part of the country's economy, with a strong gold mining sector and several different mines. Tanzania's 103rd ranking on the Global Innovation Index comes primarily through its creative outputs, market sophistication, and institutions - all of which are in the second percentile of global scores.9. Republic of SenegalGlobal Innovation Index (2022) Ranking: 99 The Republic of Senegal is a West African country with a $72 billion GDP. Agriculture is a major part of the economy, with fish forming a large part of its exports. This is however overshadowed by mining which is Senegal's largest source of foreign exchange, with gold being the dominant export production. Senegal also exports petroleum products, and the country has flipped flopped on the Global Innovation Index. Its highest rank in the past three years was 96 in 2019, which dropped to 105 in 2020 and now it's back at 99. Senegal's institutional strength contributes heavily to its ranking, as it is the only sector that is in the third quartile of global rankings - outpacing several other African nations.8. Republic of NamibiaGlobal Innovation Index (2022) Ranking: 96The Republic of Namibia is a relatively younger country that gained independence in 1990 from South Africa. It has a $26 billion economy, which, due to a small population, lends it a high GDP per capita of $10,448 by African standards. Manufacturing is a strong contributor to the Namibian economy, with the government offering subsidies to small and medium enterprises (SME) and opening export processing zones. The country also has an automotive parts supplier for big ticket car companies such as BMW, Audi, and Opel. It also has diamond cutting and polishing factories. Cumulatively, these make it one of the most advanced African countries. Namibia also relies on tourism to generate revenue, with sport hunting being an important constituent. Namibians are among some of the wealthiest people in Africa, with the country having more than 3,000 U.S dollar millionaires in 2017.7. Republic of GhanaGlobal Innovation Index (2022) Ranking: 95The Republic of Ghana is a West African country with a $226 billion GDP. Its major exports are gold, cocoa beans, and crude oil. The country's manufacturing sector is quite developed, with Ghana making its own phones, electronics, and even electric cars. In fact, the country has made electric cars for close to a decade now. It is also one of the few countries in the region with some involvement in the space sector. The country launched an Earth observation military satellite in 2015, and large chunks of its electricity are generated through wind and solar power. Space exploration and renewable energy require significant scientific know-how. Therefore, Ghana is perhaps one of the most advanced African nations because of them.6. Arab Republic of EgyptGlobal Innovation Index (2022) Ranking: 89 The Arab Republic of Egypt is located both in Asia and Africa, but most of its landmass is in the former. Renowned for its long history, the country is a major power on the African continent.  Its economy, in nominal terms, is the second largest on the continent, and the country manufactures a host of different products such as consumer electronics, chemicals, fertilizers, textiles, and automobiles. Some notable Egyptian firms are Arab American Vehicles, Egypt Basic Industries Corporation (EBIC), the Olympic Group, and Ezz Steel. Additionally, Egypt is central to world trade as well, with its renowned Suez Canal seeing thousands of ships pass through it each year as it is one of the main trade routes in the world that connects Asia with Europe, with the alternate requiring ships to pass around Africa instead. In terms of world trade and diversity of industrial production, Egypt ranks high in the list of advanced African nations. Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Advanced Countries in Africa.  Suggested Articles:Top 20 Industries in the World11 Biggest BNPL Companies in the WorldCountries By GDP: 30 Biggest Economies in the WorldDisclosure: None. 12 Most Advanced Countries in Africa is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley Morgan Stanley Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe insider, Eric Grossman, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$3.4m worth of shares at a price of US$102 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$86.11. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Morgan Stanley shares, than buying. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Morgan Stanley insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$380m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Morgan Stanley Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Morgan Stanley shares in the last quarter. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Morgan Stanley, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Morgan Stanley.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

For more countries, head on over to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Africa. Africa is one of the richest continents in the world when it comes to natural resources. The continent has vast resources of valuable metals such as cobalt, gold, platinum, and coltan. However, at the same time, it is also one of the least developed regions in the world, as years of colonialism, strife, political uncertainty, and conflicts have hampered the continent with the world's youngest population from growing.However, Africa's young population and the continent's mineral resources are crucial to unlocking growth in the region. This is due to the fact that there is strong potential for several industries in Africa to grow in order for the continent to wean off from exports and produce its own food. For instance, research from the Brookings Institution highlights that Africa has one of the strongest consumer goods industries in the world. This growth, as of 2018, had ended up outpacing the overall African gross domestic product (GDP) growth, as consumer expenditure grew by a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 3.9% between 2010 and 2015 as it touched $1.4 trillion.This growth won't stop there, as, by 2025 and 2030, the expenditure is slated to grow to $2.1 trillion and $2.5 trillion, respectively. Most of Africa's consumer goods companies are located in South Africa with some present in Nigeria as well. Notable examples are Tiger Brands Limited (JSE:TBS.JO), RCL Foods Limited (JSE:RCL.JO), and Flour Mills Nigeria (NGX:FLOURMILL).Another key African growth industry is agriculture. According to Oxford Business Group, the majority of the African population is employed in agriculture, and the sector's massive potential is simply evident in the fact that 60% of the world's uncultivated arable land is in Africa.

(TSE:STGO) Set To Breakeven,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/loss-making-steppe-gold-ltd-143251680.html,1671892371,STORY,['GC=F'],"[Steppe Gold Ltd. (TSE:STGO) is possibly approaching a major achievement in its business, so we would like to shine some light on the company. Steppe Gold Ltd. acquires, explores for, develops, and operates precious metals in Mongolia. With the latest financial year loss of US$23m and a trailing-twelve-month loss of US$14m, the CA$78m market-cap company alleviated its loss by moving closer towards its target of breakeven. As path to profitability is the topic on Steppe Gold's investors mind, we've decided to gauge market sentiment. Below we will provide a high-level summary of the industry analysts’ expectations for the company. View our latest analysis for Steppe Gold Consensus from 3 of the Canadian Metals and Mining analysts is that Steppe Gold is on the verge of breakeven. They anticipate the company to incur a final loss in 2021, before generating positive profits of US$3.4m in 2022. So, the company is predicted to breakeven approximately 12 months from now or less. How fast will the company have to grow to reach the consensus forecasts that anticipate breakeven by 2022? Working backwards from analyst estimates, it turns out that they expect the company to grow 179% year-on-year, on average, which signals high confidence from analysts. Should the business grow at a slower rate, it will become profitable at a later date than expected.earnings-per-share-growthWe're not going to go through company-specific developments for Steppe Gold given that this is a high-level summary, though, bear in mind that generally a metal and mining business has lumpy cash flows which are contingent on the natural resource mined and stage at which the company is operating. This means that a high growth rate is not unusual, especially if the company is currently in an investment period.Before we wrap up, there’s one issue worth mentioning. Steppe Gold currently has a debt-to-equity ratio of over 2x. Typically, debt shouldn’t exceed 40% of your equity, and the company has considerably exceeded this. Note that a higher debt obligation increases the risk in investing in the loss-making company.Story continuesNext Steps:This article is not intended to be a comprehensive analysis on Steppe Gold, so if you are interested in understanding the company at a deeper level, take a look at Steppe Gold's company page on Simply Wall St. We've also compiled a list of important aspects you should further examine:Valuation: What is Steppe Gold worth today?

It also outlined its process for the Figma deal. In the fourth quarter, Adobe posted revenue growing by 10.2% Y/Y to $4.53 billion. It posted strong, record cash flow from operations of $2.33 billion. The software company posted growth in Digital Media, Creative, and Document Cloud.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAdobe has millions of monthly active users. It spurred subscription signups by offering 20,000 more fonts in its offering. Customers are willing to pay more for the highest quality templates. Creative Cloud Express is at the top of the funnel business. It gives Adobe a means to upsell its paid products. In this economic client, potential customers need to try the free tier first. From there, their repeat usage leads to a sale.The Figma acquisition is the next phase of growth. Adobe needs to navigate through the regulatory reviews first. Until the deal closes, the company will concentrate on drawing new users and retaining existing ones.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphoneSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comStory continuesAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is trading in the $90 range at the time of writing. GOOG stock lost momentum when investors sold tech stocks. Alphabet is about to reignite growth in 2023, and YouTube is positioned to benefit from the streaming boom. To maximize profits, Alphabet will introduce more actionable options for viewers. For example, to drive more shopping, it will introduce product feeds, application campaigns, and live commerce features.Alphabet will also strengthen viewership figures in the next year. This will encourage advertisers to turn to YouTube. The company included Discovery ads by expanding them in Shorts last quarter. Advertisers saw an over 70% increase in conversions on Shorts. Also, to slow costs, Alphabet will slow its pace of hiring. Chances are high that it will trim its job count throughout 2023. The search giant will adjust its expenses depending on economic health. In the hardware segment, Google Pixel phone sales should thrive. Its launch of the inexpensive Pixel 6a will drive volume sales higher.Altria Group (MO)Altria Group, Inc. (MO) logo of US producer and marketer of tobacco and cigarettes is seen on a mobile phone screen.Source: viewimage / Shutterstock.comAltria Group (NYSE:MO) is a major investor in Juul Labs, an e-cigarette manufacturer. On Dec. 9, Juul agreed to pay $1.2 billion to settle 10,000 lawsuits. This should help remove the uncertainty that hurt MO stock. In addition, Altria has a strong, consistent cash flow that it will use to retire its maturing debt. It will invest the rest of its capital in research and development on e-vapors. Before it increases such investments, Altria needs to see the Food and Drug Administration authorizing more e-vapor products.CEO Billy Gifford believes that several factors shape the heated tobacco space. Each category of heated tobacco needs regulatory decisions. The sector needs innovation over time that addresses consumer preferences. Altria’s business is ready to pivot away from cigarettes and toward smoke-free products. It will prioritize the product category that consumers want the most. The company has an established sales force that is ready to promote the new product when it is ready.Fortinet (FTNT)a business man pressing a button with an open lock on it that's connected to a symbol of a cloud and various security related iconsSource: ShutterstockFortinet (NASDAQ:FTNT) is a cybersecurity firm. It sells products like firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion prevention systems. The SD-WAN market is growing quickly at around 45% year over year. Fortinet is growing its market share in this space. This should help the company post strong profits in 2023. Furthermore, Fortinet invested in enterprise sales. This includes direct marketing and a direct sales force.Shareholders should expect strong growth from here. Service revenue is a big component of the overall total. Thanks to its enhanced technology, Fortinet will retain its strong position in the Fortinet security fabric. In addition, to increase margins while improving customer satisfaction, it offers FortiCare. This offering grew by 45% year over year and will keep growing.In the last quarter, Fortinet posted total revenue of $1.15 billion, up by 33% year over year. In 2023, product revenue will likely grow in the 10% to 20% range. Growth will improve when the industry resolves the supply chain issue.Realty Income (O)Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.Source: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / ShutterstockRealty Income (NYSE:O) is a real estate investment trust (REIT). In the third quarter, the company posted a net income of 36 cents a share. It also declared its 100th consecutive quarterly dividend increase, and now carries a dividend yield of 4.64%. The REIT benefited from owning attractively priced capital. The spread between the average cost of capital and the price of capital was 165 basis points. In 2023, Realty Income’s cap rates will move higher.

Fortunately, Salesforce is in good hands with CEO Marc Benioff. The company started to feel pressure from its customers in July. The deal size shrank when clients required multiple layers of approvals. CRM stock fell as investors realized the elongating sales cycles will delay its revenue growth. When customers appreciate the cost efficiencies from Salesforce’s automation and productivity offering, orders will recover.VICI Properties (VICI)a room of slot machines in a casino to represent gambling stocksSource: ShutterstockVICI Properties (NYSE:VICI) is another hot REIT to consider, with a dividend yield of about 4.8%. It has opportunities to invest with its over $4 billion of liquidity. CEO Ed Pitoniak said that VICI will put almost $1.3 billion of effective cash to work in private and public operators.The company raised $5 billion in April and hedged its portfolio in that time. To maintain its spread from the cost of capital, VICI will look for deals that benefit its shareholders. Despite the volatility in the cost of capital, the firm’s equity held up well compared to the REIT index. Its strong equity cost gives it an advantage. Expect VICI’s valuation to rise as investors pick the strongest companies.The company does not have any major debt maturities until 2024. Until then, it will seek accretive deals that add to its growth. Currently, VICI has a strong balance sheet. In the next two years, it will bring down its leverage through funding deals using its free cash flow.On the date of publication, Chris Lau did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Fortunately, there are tools to help. The Smart Score is a data collection and collation tool from TipRanks, using an AI-powered algorithm to sort the data on every stock according to a series of factors, 8 in all, that are known for their strong correlation with future share outperformance.That all sounds like a mouthful, but it boils down to this: a sophisticated data tool that gives you a simple score, on a 1 to 10 scale, to judge the prospects of any given stock. It puts the complex world of stock market data at your fingertips.The Perfect 10, of course, should be a brilliant neon sign post guiding investors in for a closer look – and sometimes, it guides investors toward stocks that have never lacked for headline or notice. These are some of the market’s giants, stocks that are household names, feature trillion-dollar market caps, and boast Strong Buy consensus ratings from the Street’s best professional analysts. So, let’s give two of them a closer look.Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)First up on our list is Microsoft, one of the best-known brand names in the world – and also the second-largest publicly traded company in the world, with a market cap of $1.78 trillion. Microsoft got its start back in the mid-70s, and was part of the initial expansion of the personal computer tech revolution. The company rose to prominence when its Windows operating system became the industry standard, still used today, for the majority of all personal computing.Today, the company is adapting successfully to the growing cloud computing environment, offering products such as Office 365, which brings the Office applications for home, school, and small business use onto the cloud; Dynamics 365, which does the same for business applications; and the Azure platform to support cloud computing operations. At the same time, the company maintains service and support for its more modern Windows operating systems.Story continuesIn the last reported quarter, Q1 of fiscal year 2023 (September quarter), Microsoft reported $50.1 billion at the top line. This translated to a 10% increase year-over-year, and beat the $49.6 billion forecast. The solid result came on the back of a 24% reported increase in cloud revenue, to $25.7 billion, or slightly more than half of the total.On the negative side, the company reported a y/y drop in net income, by 14% to $17.6 billion, with the diluted EPS falling 13% to $2.35 per share. The real hit for investors came from the company’s fiscal Q2 guidance, which was set at $52.35 billion to $53.35 billion, or up  2% at the midpoint. This was, however, below the $56.05 billion analysts had wanted to see – and the stock fell after the earnings release.Morgan Stanley's Keith Weiss, however, remains bullish on the company's prospects. The 5-star analyst writes, “While investors worry forward numbers have not been de-risked, we see a strong (and durable) demand signal in the commercial businesses, which should lead to improving revenue and EPS growth in 2H23…. The strength of Microsoft's positioning across key secular growth segments remains unchanged. Mix shift toward faster growing Azure and Dynamics 365 and relatively durable Office 365 growth (in constant currency) help support management's goal of 20% constant currency growth across its Commercial businesses.”In Weiss’s view, Microsoft’s potential fully merits its Overweight (Buy) rating, and his $307 price target implies a one-year upside potential of 29%. (To watch Weiss’s track record, click here)Overall, Microsoft stock has picked up 27 recent ratings from Wall Street’s analysts, a total that includes 25 Buys against just 2 Holds – for a Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares are priced at $238.73, and their average target of $291.34 suggests a 22% gain on the one-year time horizon. (See MSFT stock analysis on TipRanks)Alphabet, Inc. (GOOGL)Next up is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, that everyone knows. The world’s largest search engine is part of an overall firm that boasts a $1.16 trillion market cap, making it the third largest publicly traded firm, after Microsoft and Apple. Alphabet isn’t just Google; the company also owns the Android OS, the popular YouTube website, and is even moving into the autonomous vehicle niche through its Waymo subsidiary.While Alphabet remains near the top of the global tech industry, the recent 3Q22 showed some cracks that will need to be addressed. For the most part, these are related to general economic conditions, particularly shrinking advertising budgets in the online industry. The company’s Q3 results showed total revenues of $69.09 billion, up 6% year-over-year – but that modest growth represents a distinct deceleration from the prior year’s 41% growth rate, and it missed the $70.5 billion forecast. Operating margins also fell, from 32% one year ago to 25% in the last quarter; operating income was down 18% to $17.13 billion.The miss in revenue was exacerbated by a large miss in YouTube’s top line. Advertising revenue on the video site came in at $7.07 billion, missing the $7.42 billion forecast by a 4.7% margin.While there are serious headwinds facing Alphabet/Google, we should not underestimate the company’s clear strengths. Google remains the internet’s premier search engine, and Google Search accounted for more than $39.5 billion of the total revenue. And, despite the pullback in overall online advertising, Google Ads saw revenue’s absolute numbers grow by $1.3 billion y/y, to $54.4 billion (a total that includes Google Search’s gain, as well as the pullback in YouTube advertising). Finally, the company boasts deep pockets, with over $21.9 billion in cash assets on hand. In short, Alphabet has both the market position and the resources to weather a storm.Mark Mahaney, 5-star analyst with Evercore ISI, is cognizant of GOOGL’s difficulties in the online ad segment going forward. Yet, while he predicts short term pain he also sees longer term gain: “For now, we estimate GOOGL’s organic revenue growth deteriorating further to 6% Y/Y in Q4, before beginning to recover sometime in ‘23. But after the Macro and the FX and the Comps, we strongly believe GOOGL will re-emerge as the broadest, strongest global ad revenue platform, with a dramatically profitable business model, notable diversification into Cloud Computing, and substantial long-term option value with Waymo.”Quantifying his stance on GOOGL, Mahaney rates it as Outperform (a Buy) for the year ahead and backed by a $120 price target that implies a 34% upside potential from current levels. (To watch Mahaney’s track record, click here)All of Mahaney's colleagues agree with his thesis. GOOGL shares score a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating, based on 29 recent positive analyst reviews. The stock’s average price target, $125.76, indicates potential for 41% growth from the current trading price of $89.23 over the coming year.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. And in light of that, the trends we're seeing at Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) look very promising so lets take a look.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Microsoft is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.31 = US$85b ÷ (US$360b - US$87b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, Microsoft has an ROCE of 31%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 10% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Microsoft roceIn the above chart we have measured Microsoft's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Microsoft here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEMicrosoft is displaying some positive trends. The data shows that returns on capital have increased substantially over the last five years to 31%. The amount of capital employed has increased too, by 38%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.Our Take On Microsoft's ROCEAll in all, it's terrific to see that Microsoft is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And a remarkable 196% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. So given the stock has proven it has promising trends, it's worth researching the company further to see if these trends are likely to persist.Story continuesOne more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Microsoft and understanding this should be part of your investment process.If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

15,7c5490cf-5475-3bc3-b7fb-834307721727,SBUX,2022-12-25,Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ:SBUX) Looks Just Right,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/starbucks-corporation-nasdaq-sbux-looks-140048675.html,1671890448,STORY,['SBUX'],"[Starbucks Corporation's (NASDAQ:SBUX) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 34.4x might make it look like a strong sell right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios below 14x and even P/E's below 8x are quite common. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Starbucks could be doing better as its earnings have been going backwards lately while most other companies have been seeing positive earnings growth. It might be that many expect the dour earnings performance to recover substantially, which has kept the P/E from collapsing. If not, then existing shareholders may be extremely nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for Starbucks peKeen to find out how analysts think Starbucks' future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Does Growth Match The High P/E?Starbucks' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered a frustrating 20% decrease to the company's bottom line. This means it has also seen a slide in earnings over the longer-term as EPS is down 3.0% in total over the last three years. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been undesirable for the company.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 19% per year over the next three years. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.3% each year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Starbucks is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Final WordIt's argued the price-to-earnings ratio is an inferior measure of value within certain industries, but it can be a powerful business sentiment indicator.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Starbucks' analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.You should always think about risks. Case in point, we've spotted   5 warning signs for Starbucks  you should be aware of, and 2 of them are potentially serious.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Starbucks, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

Following the 50 basis point rate hike in Dec., there are expectations that Feb. and March will see 25 basis point rate hikes, respectively. That will bring target rates near 5% which is where investors should expect them to remain throughout 2023. In short, investors should expect 2023 to look and feel like 2022 in many ways. However, there are still a good deal of hot stocks to buy. Just prepare to invest accordingly. That isn’t meant to be gloomy. Growth still exists in several areas. ARRYArray Technologies$21.53ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$94.27KYMRKymera Therapeutics$27.52MRKMerck$111.11AMDAdvanced Micro Devices$67.68HBANHuntington Bancshares$14.00PRGOPerrigo Co.$31.80Stocks to Buy: Array Technologies (ARRY)Solar penny stocks: a close up of a solar cell farmSource: Fit Ztudio / ShutterstockArray Technologies (NASDAQ:ARRY) stock should have a strong 2023 because of its exposure to solar. At the moment, the company manufactures ground-mounting systems used in solar arrays. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPlus, there are several reasons to believe 2023 will continue to be kind to the stock. For one, solar is expected to be the fastest-growing subsegment in energy in 2023 with demand spiking 20-30%. Array Technologies will also benefit from domestic content requirements in the Inflation Reduction Act. Those requirements will preference the company’s made in the U.S.A components, giving it a boost.In addition, Array Technologies’ business is booming. It reported record revenues of $515 million in its third quarter. That was a drastic improvement over the $188.6 million of revenues it posted year over year. The company is also reporting net income now after reporting losses in 2021. It’s difficult to find a serious issue that would indicate ARRY stock isn’t investment worthy. Stocks to Buy: Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)Tractor spraying pesticides on soybean field with sprayerSource: ShutterstockStory continuesArcher-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) stock is expected to have another exemplary year in 2023. At the moment, the consensus of the Wall Street analysts covering stock said it could trade at $101 within the next 12 to 18 months. Others suggest that it could run to $110 within a year. Investors should also note the company has paid a dividend without reduction since 1976. That dividend yields a modest 1.7% which increases overall returns.  Archer-Daniels-Midland sells oilseeds, corn, and wheat, and serves various end markets through its nutrition segment. It should continue to do well in 2023 as the war in Ukraine continues to disrupt global agriculture overall. That strong momentum is reflected in the company’s most recent earnings which include profits that increased by 55.9% during the period.Stocks to Buy: Kymera Therapeutics (KYMR)Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocksSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.comKymera Therapeutics (NASDAQ:KYMR) is another hot stock to buy as we near 2023. The company’s pipeline of anti-inflammatory and oncology treatments continues to move toward commercialization. Better, analysts say the KYMR stock could more than double in the next 12 to 18 months, depending on the progress of its pipeline.  One of the primary reasons to remain optimistic about Kymera Therapeutics is that it sits at the forefront of the targeted protein degradation field. The company was founded around protein degradation which it believes can serve as a basis for an entire class of future drugs. The firm also believes it recently demonstrated, for the first time, a clinically significant impact of a protein degrader outside of oncology. The company also boasts a cohort of protein degraders within the oncology field. It will share relevant clinical data around those drugs in 2023 which, if positive, will serve to potentially double its price. Merck (MRK)medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stockSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.comMerck (NYSE:MRK) also makes our list of top stocks to buy for 2023. Most impressive, company sales increased 14% in its third quarter year over year. Further, through the first nine months of 2022, Merck’s sales jumped 29%, from $35.2 billion to $45.45 billion. MRK also carries a dividend yield of 2.63% at the moment, making it even more attractive.In addition, the MRK stock has a beta of 0.41. That means it is only 41% as volatile as the prevailing markets over the past 5 years. That should continue to be a strong point of attraction as a recession is expected beginning in late 2023. Two, it has a strong tailwind in that its immunotherapy has shown to be effective when taken in conjunction with Moderna’s (NASDAQ:MRNA) mRNA cancer vaccine. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock precipitously in 2022. It currently trades near $67 at the time of writing after being nearly halved.  Fed interest rates will probably stay around 5% throughout 2023. In addition, It is expected that AMD will see an annual 28% earnings increase over the next 3 to 5 years. Investors won’t ignore that forever. So money invested in AMD stock now is very likely to appreciate in value quickly. Analysts seem to like the AMD stock, too. UBS upgraded AMD to a buy rating, with a price target of $95 a share.  Baird analyst Tristan Gerra also just upgraded the AMD stock to outperform with a price target of $100, believing the company’s newest Genoa chips could widen the company’s competitive moat.“Genoa’s very significant performance step up should translate into an acceleration in market share gains for AMD in 2023, along with significantly higher pricing and a higher gross margin profile, reinforcing AMD’s EPYC performance leadership for years to come,” as noted by Yahoo Finance.Huntington Bancshares (HBAN)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) stock should continue to do well in New Year 2023.  The Ohio-based commercial and consumer bank increased its prime rate to 7.5% on Dec. 15. That is a very solid indication that it should continue to see rapidly growing interest income into 2023. Essentially, Huntington Bancshares will charge more interest to its customers and therefore receive a greater amount of interest income. The company had already raised its prime rate to 7% in Nov. What’s interesting is that all of the effects of those rising rates will be reflected in fourth quarter earnings. That follows an already strong third quarter earnings report in which interest income increased 11%, reaching $143 million. In short, investors can expect already strong revenues to get even stronger for the company. On top of that, Huntington Bancshares includes a dividend yielding 4.58% that can be used to increase gains through reinvestment. Perrigo (PRGO)Perrigo (NYSE:PRGO) is another one of the hot stocks to buy in 2023 . The company owns HRA Pharma which submitted an application for an over-the-counter (OTC) birth control pill back in July. That submission occurred just after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe. v Wade. If its submission is successful, Perrigo will be the company with the first OTC birth control pill in the U.S. Perrigo is a French company that continues to grow. Sales reached $1.1 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.04 billion a year prior. Sales also increased 8.67% through the first nine months of 2022, reaching $3.296 billion. Yet, at the same time, Perrigo is facing increasing costs leading to higher operating expenses. That has resulted in increasing net losses through Q3 ‘22 that swelled from $78.5 million to $116.9 million. Losses should get better in 2023 as the effects of rate increases work through the economy. In any case, potential OTC approval makes Perrigo worth buying as we move into the new year.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:HCA). The company's stock led the NYSE gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine HCA Healthcare’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare What's The Opportunity In HCA Healthcare?Good news, investors! HCA Healthcare is still a bargain right now according to my price multiple model, which compares the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 12.66x is currently well-below the industry average of 21.39x, meaning that it is trading at a cheaper price relative to its peers. What’s more interesting is that, HCA Healthcare’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.Can we expect growth from HCA Healthcare?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. HCA Healthcare's earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since HCA is currently below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on HCA for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy HCA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

The housing market is in free fall as interest rates rise, the auto market is souring quickly with the number of repossessions higher than pre-pandemic levels, and inflation is still at 40-year highs. Bear markets tend to be measured in months, while bull markets last for years, so it's not so much when you buy stocks but rather that you buy quality companies and hold onto them.Continue reading]"

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on Schlumberger's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. View our latest analysis for Schlumberger How Is ROE Calculated?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Schlumberger is:17% = US$3.0b ÷ US$18b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.17 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Schlumberger's Earnings Growth And 17% ROETo start with, Schlumberger's ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 10% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Yet, Schlumberger has posted measly growth of 4.5% over the past five years. That's a bit unexpected from a company which has such a high rate of return. We reckon that a low growth, when returns are quite high could be the result of certain circumstances like low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesGiven that the industry shrunk its earnings at a rate of 5.0% in the same period, the net income growth of the company is quite impressive.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is SLB worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether SLB is currently mispriced by the market.Is Schlumberger Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Despite having a normal LTM (or last twelve month) payout ratio of 28% (or a retention ratio of 72% over the past three years, Schlumberger has seen very little growth in earnings as we saw above. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.In addition, Schlumberger has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 27%. Still, forecasts suggest that Schlumberger's future ROE will rise to 22% even though the the company's payout ratio is not expected to change by much.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that Schlumberger's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at the current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings are expected to gain momentum.

21,bc3ff03d-7673-3ccd-8c49-cd98926b1702,PRGO,2022-12-25,7 Perfect Presents to Gift Your 2023 Stock Portfolio,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-perfect-presents-gift-2023-215702678.html,1671659822,STORY,"['AMD', 'HBAN', 'PRGO', 'ARRY', 'KYMR', 'ADM', 'MRK']","[New Year 2023 will see a continued tightening of monetary policy as the Federal Reserve attempts to rein in sky-high inflation. Following the 50 basis point rate hike in Dec., there are expectations that Feb. and March will see 25 basis point rate hikes, respectively. That will bring target rates near 5% which is where investors should expect them to remain throughout 2023. In short, investors should expect 2023 to look and feel like 2022 in many ways. However, there are still a good deal of hot stocks to buy. Just prepare to invest accordingly. That isn’t meant to be gloomy. Growth still exists in several areas. ARRYArray Technologies$21.53ADMArcher-Daniels-Midland$94.27KYMRKymera Therapeutics$27.52MRKMerck$111.11AMDAdvanced Micro Devices$67.68HBANHuntington Bancshares$14.00PRGOPerrigo Co.$31.80Stocks to Buy: Array Technologies (ARRY)Solar penny stocks: a close up of a solar cell farmSource: Fit Ztudio / ShutterstockArray Technologies (NASDAQ:ARRY) stock should have a strong 2023 because of its exposure to solar. At the moment, the company manufactures ground-mounting systems used in solar arrays. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPlus, there are several reasons to believe 2023 will continue to be kind to the stock. For one, solar is expected to be the fastest-growing subsegment in energy in 2023 with demand spiking 20-30%. Array Technologies will also benefit from domestic content requirements in the Inflation Reduction Act. Those requirements will preference the company’s made in the U.S.A components, giving it a boost.In addition, Array Technologies’ business is booming. It reported record revenues of $515 million in its third quarter. That was a drastic improvement over the $188.6 million of revenues it posted year over year. The company is also reporting net income now after reporting losses in 2021. It’s difficult to find a serious issue that would indicate ARRY stock isn’t investment worthy. Stocks to Buy: Archer-Daniels-Midland (ADM)Tractor spraying pesticides on soybean field with sprayerSource: ShutterstockStory continuesArcher-Daniels-Midland (NYSE:ADM) stock is expected to have another exemplary year in 2023. At the moment, the consensus of the Wall Street analysts covering stock said it could trade at $101 within the next 12 to 18 months. Others suggest that it could run to $110 within a year. Investors should also note the company has paid a dividend without reduction since 1976. That dividend yields a modest 1.7% which increases overall returns.  Archer-Daniels-Midland sells oilseeds, corn, and wheat, and serves various end markets through its nutrition segment. It should continue to do well in 2023 as the war in Ukraine continues to disrupt global agriculture overall. That strong momentum is reflected in the company’s most recent earnings which include profits that increased by 55.9% during the period.Stocks to Buy: Kymera Therapeutics (KYMR)Biotechnology stocks, biomedical stocksSource: aslysun / Shutterstock.comKymera Therapeutics (NASDAQ:KYMR) is another hot stock to buy as we near 2023. The company’s pipeline of anti-inflammatory and oncology treatments continues to move toward commercialization. Better, analysts say the KYMR stock could more than double in the next 12 to 18 months, depending on the progress of its pipeline.  One of the primary reasons to remain optimistic about Kymera Therapeutics is that it sits at the forefront of the targeted protein degradation field. The company was founded around protein degradation which it believes can serve as a basis for an entire class of future drugs. The firm also believes it recently demonstrated, for the first time, a clinically significant impact of a protein degrader outside of oncology. The company also boasts a cohort of protein degraders within the oncology field. It will share relevant clinical data around those drugs in 2023 which, if positive, will serve to potentially double its price. Merck (MRK)medicine research, pharmaceutical background, LJPC stockSource: Sisacorn / Shutterstock.comMerck (NYSE:MRK) also makes our list of top stocks to buy for 2023. Most impressive, company sales increased 14% in its third quarter year over year. Further, through the first nine months of 2022, Merck’s sales jumped 29%, from $35.2 billion to $45.45 billion. MRK also carries a dividend yield of 2.63% at the moment, making it even more attractive.In addition, the MRK stock has a beta of 0.41. That means it is only 41% as volatile as the prevailing markets over the past 5 years. That should continue to be a strong point of attraction as a recession is expected beginning in late 2023. Two, it has a strong tailwind in that its immunotherapy has shown to be effective when taken in conjunction with Moderna’s (NASDAQ:MRNA) mRNA cancer vaccine. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock precipitously in 2022. It currently trades near $67 at the time of writing after being nearly halved.  Fed interest rates will probably stay around 5% throughout 2023. In addition, It is expected that AMD will see an annual 28% earnings increase over the next 3 to 5 years. Investors won’t ignore that forever. So money invested in AMD stock now is very likely to appreciate in value quickly. Analysts seem to like the AMD stock, too. UBS upgraded AMD to a buy rating, with a price target of $95 a share.  Baird analyst Tristan Gerra also just upgraded the AMD stock to outperform with a price target of $100, believing the company’s newest Genoa chips could widen the company’s competitive moat.“Genoa’s very significant performance step up should translate into an acceleration in market share gains for AMD in 2023, along with significantly higher pricing and a higher gross margin profile, reinforcing AMD’s EPYC performance leadership for years to come,” as noted by Yahoo Finance.Huntington Bancshares (HBAN)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ:HBAN) stock should continue to do well in New Year 2023.  The Ohio-based commercial and consumer bank increased its prime rate to 7.5% on Dec. 15. That is a very solid indication that it should continue to see rapidly growing interest income into 2023. Essentially, Huntington Bancshares will charge more interest to its customers and therefore receive a greater amount of interest income. The company had already raised its prime rate to 7% in Nov. What’s interesting is that all of the effects of those rising rates will be reflected in fourth quarter earnings. That follows an already strong third quarter earnings report in which interest income increased 11%, reaching $143 million. In short, investors can expect already strong revenues to get even stronger for the company. On top of that, Huntington Bancshares includes a dividend yielding 4.58% that can be used to increase gains through reinvestment. Perrigo (PRGO)Perrigo (NYSE:PRGO) is another one of the hot stocks to buy in 2023 . The company owns HRA Pharma which submitted an application for an over-the-counter (OTC) birth control pill back in July. That submission occurred just after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe. v Wade. If its submission is successful, Perrigo will be the company with the first OTC birth control pill in the U.S. Perrigo is a French company that continues to grow. Sales reached $1.1 billion in the third quarter, up from $1.04 billion a year prior. Sales also increased 8.67% through the first nine months of 2022, reaching $3.296 billion. Yet, at the same time, Perrigo is facing increasing costs leading to higher operating expenses. That has resulted in increasing net losses through Q3 ‘22 that swelled from $78.5 million to $116.9 million. Losses should get better in 2023 as the effects of rate increases work through the economy. In any case, potential OTC approval makes Perrigo worth buying as we move into the new year.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

22,a83fcf49-8aff-36c1-8077-06b58538c79e,AIG,2022-12-25,15 Most Hated Companies in America,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-hated-companies-america-230921187.html,1671923361,STORY,"['NFLX', 'BP', 'AMZN', 'CMCSA', 'FOXA', 'XOM', 'JNJ', 'AIG', 'WMT', 'UBER']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 most hated companies in America. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most hated companies in America.In an ideal world, companies would be supported by the general population. After all, the economy of a country defines its standard of living, and the economy of a country is propped up by the major industries in the nation. And these industries are defined by the companies within each industry. After all, companies provide innovation, ideas and solutions that people need. If they didn't, they would soon be out of business. They also provide employment to the working force of a country. So why is it that most people hate corporations?Many corporations in the world, and especially the bigger ones, are disliked strongly by the general population because people believe that these companies exist for one purpose and one purpose alone: to maximize profits no matter what the cost. Even though these companies earn billions of dollars in profits each year, people believe that they do not contribute in any positive way and continue to cut costs in order to increase profit even more. This ends up benefiting only a select few such as the executives of the company and shareholders. Meanwhile, employees are sometimes overworked and underpaid, not to mention made to work in harsh conditions. Many people also hate corporations because they believe that such companies take from the country but do not provide much in return and so, they are actually a detriment.15 most hated companies in AmericaStock-Asso/Shutterstock.comYou might think that this hatred would translate to a negative impact on the company's financials and hence, its success but the discussion isn't as straightforward as you might believe. Some of the most successful companies in the world are also among the most hated primarily because of their success, and yet they do genuinely make the life of customers easier. For example, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been derided time and again for its treatment of workers, and considering the fact that there are 1.5 million workers in the company, this is an important fact to consider. However, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has made the life of consumers really easy, providing instant delivery or next-day delivery in many cases while also providing the cheapest price possible for many products, excellent customer service and a great return policy. When the lives of people are made easier, they often compromise on their beliefs.Story continuesAnother reason behind companies not suffering despite widespread hatred is because there aren't many alternatives. Take the U.S. for example. While there are anti-trust laws established to ensure competition, and there are many examples of mergers not being allowed to avoid monopolies, with the attempted merger of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) being a recent example, there are effective monopolies in some industries which has led to them being the only possible solution, no matter how poor their customer service is or no matter how many outrageous fees they tack on. Some of these companies are part of the most hated countries in America and we will discuss them in greater detail later on.It is interesting to note that just because a company is among our list of the most hated companies in America, it doesn't mean that it's universally hated. After all, maybe 10% of the population hates a specific company but maybe 30% of the population loves it. Since we're only focusing on the former criteria, it would feature in our list even though more people love it than hate it and so, being in this list doesn't mean that the company is doomed. Take Meta Platforms Inc. (META) for example. It is hated by a ton of people due to privacy concerns, data leaks and its influence on everyone, but it still has 2 billion active monthly users, and so, is nowhere near finished. Meanwhile, financial corporations such as The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is hated by most of the public but the company mainly deals with other companies and wealthy clients so public perception doesn't really hurt its bottom line. For companies which operate on a B2B model (business to business), public perception doesn't matter as much as for B2C companies (business to consumer).Of course, this doesn't mean that there are no repercussions to a company if they fail the general public. Nowadays, profits and revenue alone aren't sufficient to determine the success of the company: Environmental, social and governance (ESG) is just as important and is the biggest challenge for companies to overcome if they want to continue the level of success that they've enjoyed, or even increase it. According to PwC, itself one of the largest firms in the world, mentioned that social capital is incredibly relevant to the success of a business now. Social capital refers to the impact of the decisions taken by a business on people. According to PwC, it ""describes the stocks of knowledge, skills, experience, health and wellbeing within people; as well as the stocks of relationships, institutions, shared values and norms that exist between people. Just like other forms of capital, social capital can be increased or decreased by the ‘flows’ of social capital - the social impacts - which result from business activity."" If a business operates properly with the general well-being of society being a primary focus, it will achieve success quickly. Of course, this always has to be balanced with revenue and profitability, but the point is that both need to go hand in hand for a business to be truly successful.Speaking of audit firms, the audit industry has seen its fair share of criticism too, especially in recent year. There have been a series of high-profile failures in audit which has put the industry under scrutiny, with record fines administered to some audit firms which has resulted in the Financial Reporting Council in the United Kingdom to announce plans to overhaul corporate governance. Audit firms also see heavy workload with tight deadlines and often do not have adequate staff, resulting in high pressure for employees which in turn results in a high level of turnover, all of which are detrimental to the health of an employee as well as impacting their performance. This is a trend in audit firms throughout the world and audit firms, while taking steps in some countries, should ensure more global policies to create a proper work-life for employees.You can also consider the pharmaceutical industry as an entire industry which is disliked by the general public. Conspiracy theorists have come up with the term ""Big Pharma"" which refers to major pharmaceutical organizations with conspiracy theories alleging that the executives of these companies collude to keep medical breakthroughs from reaching the public while also citing price hikes as a way for companies to make even higher profits at the expense of the health of the general public. This reputation has seen a massive improvement in recent years as these companies worked hard to come up with a vaccine for the worst pandemic in a century, helping to avert millions of deaths and tens of millions of serious illnesses across the world.For our rankings of the most hated companies, we polled the rankings published by various other websites including 24/7 Wall Street, TheStreet.com, Bloomberg, Business Insider and Fast Company, giving precedence to companies which made multiple lists. Basically, our article reflects the approximate consensus opinion of the financial media. Some of these rankings are as old as 10 years as we intentionally picked rankings that span a long period of time. This way we are more likely to identify the companies that are consistently out of favor with the general public and the media. So now, let's take a look at the most hated companies in the America, companies which need to work hard to regain public trust, starting with number 15:15. American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG)American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) earned the ire of the general public when normal people lost their life savings and employment in the 2008 recession, while it was bailed out by the Federal Government to the tune of $180 billion and announced payments of $165 million in executive bonuses alone. In a display of rare unity, both Democrats and Republicans voiced their anger at this announcement by American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG), with even President Obama commenting on whether such a bonus was deserved at all.14. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of times mentioned: 2Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue but has faced significant controversy regarding its operations. While Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) received praised in 1982 for a nationwide recall of Tylenol after some packages of the drug had been laced with cyanide, it has garnered significant criticism based on lawsuits that its baby powder causes ovarian cancer, with damages in billions of dollars being decided against the company.13. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX)Number of times mentioned: 2Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) owns Fox News, which is the main basis for the hatred it receives. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) is criticized for only providing views sympathetic to the Republican party, and the bias present in its coverage. We believe this is a brilliant business strategy as most of the media companies stand to the left of the political spectrum.12. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of times mentioned: 2Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been a people favorite for a long time, growing massively over a short period of time. However, hatred for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has started to increase mainly because of price increases and the company pledging to crack down on multiple people using the same account. We don't think Netflix's presence in our list of the most hated companies in the US points to a negative outcome for the company or its shareholders.11. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of times mentioned: 2The ride-hailing company has over 122 million monthly users, but it has received criticism for its treatment of its drivers as gig workers. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is also disliked because of its disruption of the taxicab industry and contribution in traffic congestion. We don't think UBER deserves to be one of the ""most hated companies"" as its services addressed a massive problem for consumers who have trouble hailing a cab and getting almost anything to be delivered to their doors. UBER will probably find itself a place in an extended version of our ""most innovative companies"" article.10. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Number of times mentioned: 2Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is widely criticized for its monopoly in many areas where alternates aren't present and the difficulty customers face if they want to cancel the service. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is also derided for extremely poor customer service. The Consumerist dubbed Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) the worst company in America in 2010 and 2014.9. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of times mentioned: 2Our list could've consisted entirely of oil companies, considering how maligned they are in the eyes of the public but we settled for just two. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been accused of being aware of the contribution of fossil fuels to climate change but provided false information to investors to prop up its share price. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was also accused of hiring military units of the Indonesian National Army to provide protection to the company's assets in the country, with these units being accused of human rights violations. Exxon Mobil is also still remembered because of the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster.Overall, though, we don't think XOM's presence in the ""most hated companies"" lists affects its business materially as consumers don't really prefer one oil company over another.8. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of times mentioned: 2One of the largest banking institutions in America, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was accused of misrepresenting its exposure to Enron after the collapse of the latter. Further, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) paid $75 million in 2010 after charges were brought against the company stating that investors were misled with respect to potential losses arising from risky mortgages. Yes, we know, it is a tiny fine. Regulators fixed their mistake in 2014 as the bank agreed to pay $7 billion to resolve a Department of Justice investigation into its sale of toxic mortgage-backed securities leading up to the financial crisis.In 2018, Citigroup also agreed to pay $1 billion to settle charges brought by the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve that it had violated the Bank Secrecy Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by failing to properly monitor transactions that potentially violated U.S. sanctions.7. BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP)Number of times mentioned: 2BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) is one of the biggest oil companies in the world, and in 2010, was responsible for the worst oil spill in global history in what is now known as the Deepwater Horizon Spill. While the spill ended up costing BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) around $65 billion, this has led to the general public hating the company. The oil spill disaster affected BP's business for a few years, but we don't think it is material anymore.6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of times mentioned: 2Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is the largest private employer in the world with over 2 million employees, most of whom are being accused of being treated unfairly by the largest company in the world by revenue. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is also disliked because in many places, it has swooped in and destroyed local businesses, leaving customers no other options. That's a consequence of the success of its business model. Consumers love Walmart and prefer to shop there, just like they love Amazon.com (AMZN) even though Amazon drove several competitors out of business.Click to continue reading and see the 5 most hated companies in America. Suggested articles:15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks to Buy10 Best ASX Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 15 most hated companies in America is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

However, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has made the life of consumers really easy, providing instant delivery or next-day delivery in many cases while also providing the cheapest price possible for many products, excellent customer service and a great return policy. When the lives of people are made easier, they often compromise on their beliefs.Story continuesAnother reason behind companies not suffering despite widespread hatred is because there aren't many alternatives. Take the U.S. for example. While there are anti-trust laws established to ensure competition, and there are many examples of mergers not being allowed to avoid monopolies, with the attempted merger of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) being a recent example, there are effective monopolies in some industries which has led to them being the only possible solution, no matter how poor their customer service is or no matter how many outrageous fees they tack on. Some of these companies are part of the most hated countries in America and we will discuss them in greater detail later on.It is interesting to note that just because a company is among our list of the most hated companies in America, it doesn't mean that it's universally hated. After all, maybe 10% of the population hates a specific company but maybe 30% of the population loves it. Since we're only focusing on the former criteria, it would feature in our list even though more people love it than hate it and so, being in this list doesn't mean that the company is doomed. Take Meta Platforms Inc. (META) for example. It is hated by a ton of people due to privacy concerns, data leaks and its influence on everyone, but it still has 2 billion active monthly users, and so, is nowhere near finished. Meanwhile, financial corporations such as The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is hated by most of the public but the company mainly deals with other companies and wealthy clients so public perception doesn't really hurt its bottom line. For companies which operate on a B2B model (business to business), public perception doesn't matter as much as for B2C companies (business to consumer).Of course, this doesn't mean that there are no repercussions to a company if they fail the general public. Nowadays, profits and revenue alone aren't sufficient to determine the success of the company: Environmental, social and governance (ESG) is just as important and is the biggest challenge for companies to overcome if they want to continue the level of success that they've enjoyed, or even increase it. According to PwC, itself one of the largest firms in the world, mentioned that social capital is incredibly relevant to the success of a business now. Social capital refers to the impact of the decisions taken by a business on people. According to PwC, it ""describes the stocks of knowledge, skills, experience, health and wellbeing within people; as well as the stocks of relationships, institutions, shared values and norms that exist between people. Just like other forms of capital, social capital can be increased or decreased by the ‘flows’ of social capital - the social impacts - which result from business activity."" If a business operates properly with the general well-being of society being a primary focus, it will achieve success quickly. Of course, this always has to be balanced with revenue and profitability, but the point is that both need to go hand in hand for a business to be truly successful.Speaking of audit firms, the audit industry has seen its fair share of criticism too, especially in recent year. There have been a series of high-profile failures in audit which has put the industry under scrutiny, with record fines administered to some audit firms which has resulted in the Financial Reporting Council in the United Kingdom to announce plans to overhaul corporate governance. Audit firms also see heavy workload with tight deadlines and often do not have adequate staff, resulting in high pressure for employees which in turn results in a high level of turnover, all of which are detrimental to the health of an employee as well as impacting their performance. This is a trend in audit firms throughout the world and audit firms, while taking steps in some countries, should ensure more global policies to create a proper work-life for employees.You can also consider the pharmaceutical industry as an entire industry which is disliked by the general public. Conspiracy theorists have come up with the term ""Big Pharma"" which refers to major pharmaceutical organizations with conspiracy theories alleging that the executives of these companies collude to keep medical breakthroughs from reaching the public while also citing price hikes as a way for companies to make even higher profits at the expense of the health of the general public. This reputation has seen a massive improvement in recent years as these companies worked hard to come up with a vaccine for the worst pandemic in a century, helping to avert millions of deaths and tens of millions of serious illnesses across the world.For our rankings of the most hated companies, we polled the rankings published by various other websites including 24/7 Wall Street, TheStreet.com, Bloomberg, Business Insider and Fast Company, giving precedence to companies which made multiple lists. Basically, our article reflects the approximate consensus opinion of the financial media. Some of these rankings are as old as 10 years as we intentionally picked rankings that span a long period of time. This way we are more likely to identify the companies that are consistently out of favor with the general public and the media. So now, let's take a look at the most hated companies in the America, companies which need to work hard to regain public trust, starting with number 15:15. American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG)American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) earned the ire of the general public when normal people lost their life savings and employment in the 2008 recession, while it was bailed out by the Federal Government to the tune of $180 billion and announced payments of $165 million in executive bonuses alone. In a display of rare unity, both Democrats and Republicans voiced their anger at this announcement by American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG), with even President Obama commenting on whether such a bonus was deserved at all.14. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of times mentioned: 2Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue but has faced significant controversy regarding its operations. While Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) received praised in 1982 for a nationwide recall of Tylenol after some packages of the drug had been laced with cyanide, it has garnered significant criticism based on lawsuits that its baby powder causes ovarian cancer, with damages in billions of dollars being decided against the company.13. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX)Number of times mentioned: 2Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) owns Fox News, which is the main basis for the hatred it receives. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) is criticized for only providing views sympathetic to the Republican party, and the bias present in its coverage. We believe this is a brilliant business strategy as most of the media companies stand to the left of the political spectrum.12. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of times mentioned: 2Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been a people favorite for a long time, growing massively over a short period of time. However, hatred for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has started to increase mainly because of price increases and the company pledging to crack down on multiple people using the same account. We don't think Netflix's presence in our list of the most hated companies in the US points to a negative outcome for the company or its shareholders.11. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of times mentioned: 2The ride-hailing company has over 122 million monthly users, but it has received criticism for its treatment of its drivers as gig workers. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is also disliked because of its disruption of the taxicab industry and contribution in traffic congestion. We don't think UBER deserves to be one of the ""most hated companies"" as its services addressed a massive problem for consumers who have trouble hailing a cab and getting almost anything to be delivered to their doors. UBER will probably find itself a place in an extended version of our ""most innovative companies"" article.10. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Number of times mentioned: 2Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is widely criticized for its monopoly in many areas where alternates aren't present and the difficulty customers face if they want to cancel the service. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is also derided for extremely poor customer service. The Consumerist dubbed Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) the worst company in America in 2010 and 2014.9. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of times mentioned: 2Our list could've consisted entirely of oil companies, considering how maligned they are in the eyes of the public but we settled for just two. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been accused of being aware of the contribution of fossil fuels to climate change but provided false information to investors to prop up its share price. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was also accused of hiring military units of the Indonesian National Army to provide protection to the company's assets in the country, with these units being accused of human rights violations. Exxon Mobil is also still remembered because of the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster.Overall, though, we don't think XOM's presence in the ""most hated companies"" lists affects its business materially as consumers don't really prefer one oil company over another.8. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of times mentioned: 2One of the largest banking institutions in America, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was accused of misrepresenting its exposure to Enron after the collapse of the latter. Further, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) paid $75 million in 2010 after charges were brought against the company stating that investors were misled with respect to potential losses arising from risky mortgages. Yes, we know, it is a tiny fine. Regulators fixed their mistake in 2014 as the bank agreed to pay $7 billion to resolve a Department of Justice investigation into its sale of toxic mortgage-backed securities leading up to the financial crisis.In 2018, Citigroup also agreed to pay $1 billion to settle charges brought by the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve that it had violated the Bank Secrecy Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by failing to properly monitor transactions that potentially violated U.S. sanctions.7. BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP)Number of times mentioned: 2BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) is one of the biggest oil companies in the world, and in 2010, was responsible for the worst oil spill in global history in what is now known as the Deepwater Horizon Spill. While the spill ended up costing BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) around $65 billion, this has led to the general public hating the company. The oil spill disaster affected BP's business for a few years, but we don't think it is material anymore.6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of times mentioned: 2Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is the largest private employer in the world with over 2 million employees, most of whom are being accused of being treated unfairly by the largest company in the world by revenue. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is also disliked because in many places, it has swooped in and destroyed local businesses, leaving customers no other options. That's a consequence of the success of its business model. Consumers love Walmart and prefer to shop there, just like they love Amazon.com (AMZN) even though Amazon drove several competitors out of business.Click to continue reading and see the 5 most hated companies in America. Suggested articles:15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks to Buy10 Best ASX Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 15 most hated companies in America is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most hated companies in America.In an ideal world, companies would be supported by the general population. After all, the economy of a country defines its standard of living, and the economy of a country is propped up by the major industries in the nation. And these industries are defined by the companies within each industry. After all, companies provide innovation, ideas and solutions that people need. If they didn't, they would soon be out of business. They also provide employment to the working force of a country. So why is it that most people hate corporations?Many corporations in the world, and especially the bigger ones, are disliked strongly by the general population because people believe that these companies exist for one purpose and one purpose alone: to maximize profits no matter what the cost. Even though these companies earn billions of dollars in profits each year, people believe that they do not contribute in any positive way and continue to cut costs in order to increase profit even more. This ends up benefiting only a select few such as the executives of the company and shareholders. Meanwhile, employees are sometimes overworked and underpaid, not to mention made to work in harsh conditions. Many people also hate corporations because they believe that such companies take from the country but do not provide much in return and so, they are actually a detriment.15 most hated companies in AmericaStock-Asso/Shutterstock.comYou might think that this hatred would translate to a negative impact on the company's financials and hence, its success but the discussion isn't as straightforward as you might believe. Some of the most successful companies in the world are also among the most hated primarily because of their success, and yet they do genuinely make the life of customers easier. For example, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been derided time and again for its treatment of workers, and considering the fact that there are 1.5 million workers in the company, this is an important fact to consider.

31,14532bd7-70e8-30f5-a191-06730e7deb85,MDT,2022-12-25,Investors in Medtronic (NYSE:MDT) have unfortunately lost 26% over the last three years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-medtronic-nyse-mdt-unfortunately-120023795.html,1671969623,STORY,['MDT'],"[In order to justify the effort of selecting individual stocks, it's worth striving to beat the returns from a market index fund. But the risk of stock picking is that you will likely buy under-performing companies. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) shareholders, since the share price is down 32% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 23%. And the ride hasn't got any smoother in recent times over the last year, with the price 25% lower in that time.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. Check out our latest analysis for Medtronic While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the three years that the share price fell, Medtronic's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 2.9% each year. This reduction in EPS is slower than the 12% annual reduction in the share price. So it's likely that the EPS decline has disappointed the market, leaving investors hesitant to buy.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. As it happens, Medtronic's TSR for the last 3 years was -26%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 22% received by Medtronic shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -22%. The silver lining is that longer term investors would have made a total return of 1.6% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data remains strong, and the share price is simply down on sentiment, then this could be an opportunity worth investigating. If you would like to research Medtronic in more detail then you might want to take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in the company.If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

Some investors allocate excess cash to new investments or add to existing holdings. It makes sense to look at your portfolio and add to undervalued stocks with the prospect of solid total returns. Alternatively, some stocks that were overvalued for years are now more reasonably priced. As Peter Lynch says, “My system for over 30 years has been this: When stocks are attractive, you buy them. Sure, they can go lower. I’ve bought stocks at $12 that went to $2, but then they later went to $30.”We emphasize dividend stocks on this list of five stocking stuffer stocks to consider for Christmas 2022. Some are undervalued because of recession fears, and others face company-specific issues. But they are attractively priced, with dividend yields greater than the S&amp;P 500 and solid dividend safety.VZVerizon Communications$37.66MDTMedtronic$77.01EPDEnterprise Products$23.57PFEPfizer$51.57LOWLowe’s Companies$202.07InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVerizon (VZ)Verizon Wireless sign and trademark logo.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comVerizon (NYSE:VZ) is a company we have talked about a few times this year. The telecommunications firm is struggling to grow its retail cellular subscribers. In response, investors have sold the stock. As a result, Verizon is down almost 29% in 2022. That said, Verizon is appreciably undervalued, trading at an earnings multiple of only 7.3x, nearly the lowest in the past decade.Verizon’s dividend yield is nearly 7%, making it one of the highest-yielding blue-chip stocks and popular with dividend exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The combination of its low valuation compared to historical metrics and the high yield make the stock attractive for long-term investors. The excellent yield is combined with acceptable dividend safety of a roughly 47% payout ratio.Verizon’s retail cellular growth should turn positive again as it rolls out faster 5G service across the country. As a result, investors will probably recognize the strong reward-to-risk profile in the future. Also, the stock is suitable for those seeking income with slow dividend growth.Story continuesMedtronic (MDT)Medtronic (MDT) sign outside office building representing healthcare stocksSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comThe second stock on our list is Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), the world’s largest medical device and consumables company. The firm faces company-specific issues related to its pipeline, a warning letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), inflationary pressures and lower guidance. Shareholders have exited the stock, pushing the valuation below the long-term range and presenting an opportunity.Medtronic’s dividend yield is about 3.4%, near its 10-year high, and backed by a reasonable payout ratio of about 56%. The Dividend Aristocrat is known for its 45 years of annual dividend increases. The dividend increases are about 8% annually now.The company is on sale now and should overcome its challenges. Moreover, the firm is exiting the difficult Patient Monitoring and Respiratory Intervention business. The dividend yield, low valuation and minimal investor outlook make Medtronic an excellent stock to look at now.Enterprise Products (EPD)A magnifying glass zooms in on the website of Enterprise Product Partners (EPD)Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comEnterprise Products (NYSE:EPD) is the only master limited partnership (MLP) on the list. The American pipeline company owns 50,000-plus miles of pipelines for natural gas, oil, refined products and petrochemicals. The company has a storage capacity of more than 260 million barrels of oil and refined products and 14 billion cubic feet of natural gas.The partnership’s unit prices are still trading below pre-pandemic levels, and the valuation is lower than the historical norm. Consequently, the dividend yield is elevated at nearly 8%. Investors expect little from EPD because of regulatory pressures and the expected transition to renewables. But the company has several projects coming to fruition, and demand for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and liquefied natural gas (LNG) is high.The combination of undervaluation, high dividend yield and potential future growth make the pipeline firm attractive now because of the prospect of a high dividend yield and growing future cash flows.Pfizer (PFE)blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stockSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comPfizer (NYSE:PFE) has benefited immensely from the Covid-19 pandemic. The company’s sales increased dramatically with its Covid-19 vaccine, Comirnaty, and anti-viral drug, Paxlovid. As a result, total revenue was $99.878 million in the past 12 months compared to $41.651 million in 2020. However, the market fears Covid-related revenue will decline in the future. Hence, the stock price is still down in 2022.That said, Pfizer has several drugs with over $1 billion in annual revenue, including the Prevnar vaccine, Ibrance, Elquis, Xtandi, Vyndaqel/Vyndamax, Xeljanz and Enbrel. Hence, it is not wholly dependent on Covid-related therapies for future growth. Furthermore, the firm has spent its cash wisely, acquiring companies and therapies and positioning it for growth.Pfizer is a Dividend Contender with 13 years of annual increases. The forward dividend yield of about 3% is supported by a conservative payout ratio of 35.3% and stellar free cash flow, providing confidence about future growth and dividend safety.The stock price has recovered slightly, but the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is still only 8.4x, below the historical average. The low valuation and nice dividend yield make Pfizer a preferred choice of dividend ETFs. Small investors should probably follow their lead with this innovative company.Lowe’s Companies (LOW)the front of a Lowe's storeSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.comLowe’s Companies (NYSE:LOW) is well-known to many small investors as one of North America’s two largest home improvement retailers. Like many retailers, the year 2022 has proven challenging. Rising mortgage rates typically cause new home construction to decline affecting sales. Also, high inflation is causing house owners to concentrate on necessities rather than home remodeling.But Lowe’s is a company that investors should like for the long term. The company grows by selling more items through its stores. It adds to the store count each year too. Years of growth have permitted the firm to return cash to shareholders. As a result, Lowe’s is a Dividend King and Dividend Aristocrat with 61 years of consecutive annual increases. The retailer has had a double-digit dividend growth rate in the past decade. In addition, the conservative payout ratio of around 23% allows many more dividend increases.Lowe’s stock price is down roughly 17% in 2022 and presents an excellent buying opportunity. The forward P/E ratio is about 15.3x below the historical range. The low valuation and high dividend growth rate make Lowe’s attractive now.On the date of publication, Prakash Kolli held LONG positions in VZ stock and MDT stock.

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. To wit, the Merck share price has climbed 99% in five years, easily topping the market return of 38% (ignoring dividends). On the other hand, the more recent gains haven't been so impressive, with shareholders gaining just 52% , including dividends .So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns. View our latest analysis for Merck To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, Merck managed to grow its earnings per share at 42% a year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 15% over the same period. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Merck has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Merck, it has a TSR of 144% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Merck shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 52% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 19% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Merck .Of course Merck may not be the best stock to buy.

35,bf530333-1987-355b-9e2b-e9d9687fd6db,ROK,2022-12-25,12 Most Advanced Countries in Robotics,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/12-most-advanced-countries-robotics-151045436.html,1671894645,STORY,"['NVDA', 'CGNX', 'ROK']","[In this article, we take a look at the 12 most advanced countries in robotics. You can skip our detailed analysis of the robotics industry and go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Robotics. Robotics refers to the design, manufacturing and utilization of robots for tasks (in hardware and software) that have traditionally been performed by humans. A Robot TakeoverAutomation has been one of the most noteworthy trends in the world, with 31% businesses having fully automated at-least one business function as of 2020, according to McKinsey. Additionally, businesses that had no plans to automate operations were reduced to 16% in 2020, from 20% in 2018. Further, according to the World Economic Forum, more than half of the jobs in the workflow will be performed by robots and algorithms by 2025. Conventional wisdom suggests that robot-takeover of jobs won’t bode well for human workers. However, it has been argued that the reverse is true, with robots reducing humanity’s physical and mental labor while creating new jobs in the process. The World Economic Forum forecasts suggest that automation will create 97 million new jobs for humans by 2025.Driving FactorsRobotics offers various advantages in the workflow including consistent product/service quality in manufacturing, reduction in operating costs and lead times, and higher production output and efficiency.  Another key driving factor is long-term adaptation to the aging human population. In 2020, the number of people who were 60 years or older, outnumbered children that were less than 5 years of age. Those aged 65 or above, comprised 1 in 11 people in the world in 2019. Their population is projected to reach 1.5 billion in 2050, per the UN figures, with every 1 in 6 people being 65 years or older. Automation and robotics will play an important role to compensate for the availability of fewer people of working age in the coming decades. In fact, the future is being played out in Japan, where people who are aged 65 years or older, make up 29% of the country’s population as of 2021. This has led Japan to early-adopt robotics and automation to remain competitive, with 631 robots for every 10,000 humans in the workforce in the country.Story continuesThe necessity of automation has also made Japan pretty much a superpower in robotics. The country is the largest manufacturer and exporter of industrial robots in 2022. Robotics Industry OutlookThe global robotics market is projected to reach $215 billion in value by 2030, growing at a solid CAGR of 23% according to Market Research Future. The industrial automation market, on the other hand, is much bigger but largely overlaps with the robotics market.According to Precedence Research, the automation industry was valued at $197 billion in 2021 and is estimated to expand at a CAGR of 8.59%, to a market value of $413 billion by 2030. Major players in the two sibling industries include Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK), Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX), Boston Dynamics, Fanuc Corporation (TOKYO:6954.T), Seiko Epson Corporation (TOKYO:6724.T) and Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM). Some of the leading countries in robotics are Japan, Singapore and the US. Below, we list the 12 most advanced countries in robotics.  Most Advanced Countries in RoboticsOur MethodologyFor our list of the most advanced countries in robotics, we’ve ranked them based on their technology scene in robotics as well as their level of automation. We’ve used data from the International Federation of Robotics, especially for the robot density in the manufacturing workforce. Here are the 12 most advanced nations in robotics.12. ChinaChina, like other East Asian countries, is one of the most advanced countries in robotics. According to data from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), the Chinese market added over 240,000 new robot units in 2021, an increase of 44% as compared to the year 2020. The country had 187 robots working in the manufacturing sector for every 10,000 humans in the same year. This suggests that a significant number of factories in China have implemented automation technologies, including industrial robots, in their operations.Automation in the country is covering for the labor shortage due to an aging population while also creating new jobs. For instance, 18 professions were announced by the Chinese Ministry for Human Resources and Social Security. One of these included the ‘Robotics Engineering Technician’, a job for R&amp;D in control algorithms and operating systems for robots. Siasun Robot&amp;Automation Co.,Ltd. (SHENZHEN:300024.SZ) is one of the leading robotics companies in China.11. The NetherlandsThe Netherlands is located in Northwestern Europe. It is known for high levels of automation as well as numerous robotics companies. As of 2021, the country’s robot density in the manufacturing workflow is 224 robots for every 10,000 human workers, according to the International Federation of Robotics.The Netherlands is one of the pioneers in the most advanced robotics systems to date and is producing leading research from institutes like Radboud University. The country is also implementing AI and robotics technology to modernize industries like Agriculture, with its Wageningen UR being the top institute innovating in robotics for agriculture. 10. DenmarkDenmark is a European country in the Scandinavian region. It is one of the most developed countries in terms of science, technology, GDP per Capita and other indicators. As of 2021, Denmark has 234 robots in the manufacturing-sector workforce for every 10,000 humans. One of the key players in the Danish robotics industry is the Danish Technological Institute, which conducts research and development in a wide range of areas related to robotics and automation, including collaborative robots, service robots, and manufacturing automation. The institute also works closely with industry partners and has a number of commercial projects in development.Another important player in the Danish robotics industry is Universal Robots, a leading manufacturer of collaborative robots (also known as cobots). Based in Odense, Denmark, the company has developed a range of cobots that are used in a variety of applications, including assembly, welding, packaging, and material handling.9. SwitzerlandSwitzerland is ninth on the list of most advanced countries in robotics. There are 240 robots for every 10,000 human workers in the manufacturing industry in the country as of 2021. It is also home to some of the most noteworthy robotics companies in the world, like ANYbotics. Some of the key players in the robotics industry in Switzerland include ABB, which is a global leader in industrial robotics and automation, and Swisslog, which specializes in logistics automation solutions.Switzerland is also home to a number of research institutions and universities that are actively involved in robotics research and development. These include the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, which has a well-recognized robotics program. 8. SwedenSweden is another one of the most advanced countries when it comes to robotics. As of 2021, there are 321 robots per 10,000 humans in the manufacturing labor-force in the country.Sweden has a number of research institutions and universities that are involved in automation R&amp;D. These include the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, which has a renowned automation program, and the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, which has a strong focus on automation and control systems.Sweden made headlines for Eve, a lab robot that is extensively used in automating research processes in the country. Apart from its own robotics companies, Sweden also benefits from the presence of American companies like Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK), Cognex Corporation (NYSE:CGNX) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).7. United StatesThe United States is one of the most advanced western nations in robotics. Its robots to human workers ratio is lower than Germany’s, at 274 robots per 10,000 humans, but the country makes up for it with advanced robotics technology.Some of the top tech corporations in the US like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) and Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) are highly focused on robotics.Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) primarily develops high-end GPUs, which have been found to have many applications for robotics and machine learning. Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) and Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX), on the other hand, are two of the premier automation companies in the US with a global presence. There has been a record adoption of industrial robots in the US in the past decade. In 2019, however, the trend started slowing down and the decline continued well into 2020, with 8% fewer installations than the previous year. The slow down can largely be attributed to the pandemic and factory closures due to lockdowns. 6. Hong Kong, SARHong Kong has an advanced manufacturing and research infrastructure, which the country has used to advance in robotics among many other fields. There are 304 robots in Hong Kong for every 10,000 human workers as of 2021. Given its population, the number of robots amounts to over 224,000.Insight Robotics and Rehab Robotics are two of the most prominent robotics startups in Hong Kong. The small nation also hosts Hanson Robotics, the designer and manufacturer of Sophia, the Robot.Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Advanced Countries in Robotics.

Although, it's not wise to just take the P/E at face value as there may be an explanation why it's limited.Recent times have been advantageous for Pfizer as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It might be that many expect the strong earnings performance to degrade substantially, which has repressed the P/E. If not, then existing shareholders have reason to be quite optimistic about the future direction of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer peKeen to find out how analysts think Pfizer's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.Is There Any Growth For Pfizer?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as low as Pfizer's is when the company's growth is on track to lag the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 54% gain to the company's bottom line. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 85% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings growth is heading into negative territory, declining 14% per year over the next three years. That's not great when the rest of the market is expected to grow by 9.3% per year.With this information, we are not surprised that Pfizer is trading at a P/E lower than the market. Nonetheless, there's no guarantee the P/E has reached a floor yet with earnings going in reverse. There's potential for the P/E to fall to even lower levels if the company doesn't improve its profitability.The Final WordWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Story continuesWe've established that Pfizer maintains its low P/E on the weakness of its forecast for sliding earnings, as expected. Right now shareholders are accepting the low P/E as they concede future earnings probably won't provide any pleasant surprises. Unless these conditions improve, they will continue to form a barrier for the share price around these levels.And what about other risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Pfizer   you should know about.If these risks are making you reconsider your opinion on Pfizer, explore our interactive list of high quality stocks to get an idea of what else is out there.Have feedback on this article?

39,a83fcf49-8aff-36c1-8077-06b58538c79e,FOXA,2022-12-25,15 Most Hated Companies in America,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-hated-companies-america-230921187.html,1671923361,STORY,"['NFLX', 'BP', 'AMZN', 'CMCSA', 'FOXA', 'XOM', 'JNJ', 'AIG', 'WMT', 'UBER']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 most hated companies in America. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most hated companies in America.In an ideal world, companies would be supported by the general population. After all, the economy of a country defines its standard of living, and the economy of a country is propped up by the major industries in the nation. And these industries are defined by the companies within each industry. After all, companies provide innovation, ideas and solutions that people need. If they didn't, they would soon be out of business. They also provide employment to the working force of a country. So why is it that most people hate corporations?Many corporations in the world, and especially the bigger ones, are disliked strongly by the general population because people believe that these companies exist for one purpose and one purpose alone: to maximize profits no matter what the cost. Even though these companies earn billions of dollars in profits each year, people believe that they do not contribute in any positive way and continue to cut costs in order to increase profit even more. This ends up benefiting only a select few such as the executives of the company and shareholders. Meanwhile, employees are sometimes overworked and underpaid, not to mention made to work in harsh conditions. Many people also hate corporations because they believe that such companies take from the country but do not provide much in return and so, they are actually a detriment.15 most hated companies in AmericaStock-Asso/Shutterstock.comYou might think that this hatred would translate to a negative impact on the company's financials and hence, its success but the discussion isn't as straightforward as you might believe. Some of the most successful companies in the world are also among the most hated primarily because of their success, and yet they do genuinely make the life of customers easier. For example, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been derided time and again for its treatment of workers, and considering the fact that there are 1.5 million workers in the company, this is an important fact to consider. However, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has made the life of consumers really easy, providing instant delivery or next-day delivery in many cases while also providing the cheapest price possible for many products, excellent customer service and a great return policy. When the lives of people are made easier, they often compromise on their beliefs.Story continuesAnother reason behind companies not suffering despite widespread hatred is because there aren't many alternatives. Take the U.S. for example. While there are anti-trust laws established to ensure competition, and there are many examples of mergers not being allowed to avoid monopolies, with the attempted merger of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) being a recent example, there are effective monopolies in some industries which has led to them being the only possible solution, no matter how poor their customer service is or no matter how many outrageous fees they tack on. Some of these companies are part of the most hated countries in America and we will discuss them in greater detail later on.It is interesting to note that just because a company is among our list of the most hated companies in America, it doesn't mean that it's universally hated. After all, maybe 10% of the population hates a specific company but maybe 30% of the population loves it. Since we're only focusing on the former criteria, it would feature in our list even though more people love it than hate it and so, being in this list doesn't mean that the company is doomed. Take Meta Platforms Inc. (META) for example. It is hated by a ton of people due to privacy concerns, data leaks and its influence on everyone, but it still has 2 billion active monthly users, and so, is nowhere near finished. Meanwhile, financial corporations such as The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is hated by most of the public but the company mainly deals with other companies and wealthy clients so public perception doesn't really hurt its bottom line. For companies which operate on a B2B model (business to business), public perception doesn't matter as much as for B2C companies (business to consumer).Of course, this doesn't mean that there are no repercussions to a company if they fail the general public. Nowadays, profits and revenue alone aren't sufficient to determine the success of the company: Environmental, social and governance (ESG) is just as important and is the biggest challenge for companies to overcome if they want to continue the level of success that they've enjoyed, or even increase it. According to PwC, itself one of the largest firms in the world, mentioned that social capital is incredibly relevant to the success of a business now. Social capital refers to the impact of the decisions taken by a business on people. According to PwC, it ""describes the stocks of knowledge, skills, experience, health and wellbeing within people; as well as the stocks of relationships, institutions, shared values and norms that exist between people. Just like other forms of capital, social capital can be increased or decreased by the ‘flows’ of social capital - the social impacts - which result from business activity."" If a business operates properly with the general well-being of society being a primary focus, it will achieve success quickly. Of course, this always has to be balanced with revenue and profitability, but the point is that both need to go hand in hand for a business to be truly successful.Speaking of audit firms, the audit industry has seen its fair share of criticism too, especially in recent year. There have been a series of high-profile failures in audit which has put the industry under scrutiny, with record fines administered to some audit firms which has resulted in the Financial Reporting Council in the United Kingdom to announce plans to overhaul corporate governance. Audit firms also see heavy workload with tight deadlines and often do not have adequate staff, resulting in high pressure for employees which in turn results in a high level of turnover, all of which are detrimental to the health of an employee as well as impacting their performance. This is a trend in audit firms throughout the world and audit firms, while taking steps in some countries, should ensure more global policies to create a proper work-life for employees.You can also consider the pharmaceutical industry as an entire industry which is disliked by the general public. Conspiracy theorists have come up with the term ""Big Pharma"" which refers to major pharmaceutical organizations with conspiracy theories alleging that the executives of these companies collude to keep medical breakthroughs from reaching the public while also citing price hikes as a way for companies to make even higher profits at the expense of the health of the general public. This reputation has seen a massive improvement in recent years as these companies worked hard to come up with a vaccine for the worst pandemic in a century, helping to avert millions of deaths and tens of millions of serious illnesses across the world.For our rankings of the most hated companies, we polled the rankings published by various other websites including 24/7 Wall Street, TheStreet.com, Bloomberg, Business Insider and Fast Company, giving precedence to companies which made multiple lists. Basically, our article reflects the approximate consensus opinion of the financial media. Some of these rankings are as old as 10 years as we intentionally picked rankings that span a long period of time. This way we are more likely to identify the companies that are consistently out of favor with the general public and the media. So now, let's take a look at the most hated companies in the America, companies which need to work hard to regain public trust, starting with number 15:15. American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG)American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) earned the ire of the general public when normal people lost their life savings and employment in the 2008 recession, while it was bailed out by the Federal Government to the tune of $180 billion and announced payments of $165 million in executive bonuses alone. In a display of rare unity, both Democrats and Republicans voiced their anger at this announcement by American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG), with even President Obama commenting on whether such a bonus was deserved at all.14. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of times mentioned: 2Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue but has faced significant controversy regarding its operations. While Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) received praised in 1982 for a nationwide recall of Tylenol after some packages of the drug had been laced with cyanide, it has garnered significant criticism based on lawsuits that its baby powder causes ovarian cancer, with damages in billions of dollars being decided against the company.13. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX)Number of times mentioned: 2Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) owns Fox News, which is the main basis for the hatred it receives. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) is criticized for only providing views sympathetic to the Republican party, and the bias present in its coverage. We believe this is a brilliant business strategy as most of the media companies stand to the left of the political spectrum.12. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of times mentioned: 2Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been a people favorite for a long time, growing massively over a short period of time. However, hatred for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has started to increase mainly because of price increases and the company pledging to crack down on multiple people using the same account. We don't think Netflix's presence in our list of the most hated companies in the US points to a negative outcome for the company or its shareholders.11. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of times mentioned: 2The ride-hailing company has over 122 million monthly users, but it has received criticism for its treatment of its drivers as gig workers. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is also disliked because of its disruption of the taxicab industry and contribution in traffic congestion. We don't think UBER deserves to be one of the ""most hated companies"" as its services addressed a massive problem for consumers who have trouble hailing a cab and getting almost anything to be delivered to their doors. UBER will probably find itself a place in an extended version of our ""most innovative companies"" article.10. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Number of times mentioned: 2Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is widely criticized for its monopoly in many areas where alternates aren't present and the difficulty customers face if they want to cancel the service. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is also derided for extremely poor customer service. The Consumerist dubbed Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) the worst company in America in 2010 and 2014.9. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of times mentioned: 2Our list could've consisted entirely of oil companies, considering how maligned they are in the eyes of the public but we settled for just two. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been accused of being aware of the contribution of fossil fuels to climate change but provided false information to investors to prop up its share price. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was also accused of hiring military units of the Indonesian National Army to provide protection to the company's assets in the country, with these units being accused of human rights violations. Exxon Mobil is also still remembered because of the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster.Overall, though, we don't think XOM's presence in the ""most hated companies"" lists affects its business materially as consumers don't really prefer one oil company over another.8. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of times mentioned: 2One of the largest banking institutions in America, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was accused of misrepresenting its exposure to Enron after the collapse of the latter. Further, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) paid $75 million in 2010 after charges were brought against the company stating that investors were misled with respect to potential losses arising from risky mortgages. Yes, we know, it is a tiny fine. Regulators fixed their mistake in 2014 as the bank agreed to pay $7 billion to resolve a Department of Justice investigation into its sale of toxic mortgage-backed securities leading up to the financial crisis.In 2018, Citigroup also agreed to pay $1 billion to settle charges brought by the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve that it had violated the Bank Secrecy Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by failing to properly monitor transactions that potentially violated U.S. sanctions.7. BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP)Number of times mentioned: 2BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) is one of the biggest oil companies in the world, and in 2010, was responsible for the worst oil spill in global history in what is now known as the Deepwater Horizon Spill. While the spill ended up costing BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) around $65 billion, this has led to the general public hating the company. The oil spill disaster affected BP's business for a few years, but we don't think it is material anymore.6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of times mentioned: 2Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is the largest private employer in the world with over 2 million employees, most of whom are being accused of being treated unfairly by the largest company in the world by revenue. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is also disliked because in many places, it has swooped in and destroyed local businesses, leaving customers no other options. That's a consequence of the success of its business model. Consumers love Walmart and prefer to shop there, just like they love Amazon.com (AMZN) even though Amazon drove several competitors out of business.Click to continue reading and see the 5 most hated companies in America. Suggested articles:15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks to Buy10 Best ASX Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 15 most hated companies in America is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

But is getting a degree going the way of bell bottoms, cable television and calling someone on the phone?With a strong economy and an excess of jobs with few workers to take them, big companies like Google, IBM and Delta Air Lines have eased up on educational requirements in an effort to find hires based on skills and experience instead.With a four-year degree perhaps seemingly not as crucial for Americans climbing the career ladder as it once was — young people might be rethinking the need for higher education as well.“It's a bit [like] musical chairs right now,” says Alicia Modestino, an associate professor and labor economist at Northeastern University. “We're seeing a lot of people shift jobs, move up in the labor market. That’s great.”However, she warns that with the Fed raising interest rates in an effort to quell inflation, Americans need to be prepared for the job market to slow in the coming months.“Pretty soon the music's going to stop — so you want to have someplace to land that's going to be good for the long term.”Don't missBetter than NFTs: You don't have to be ultra-rich to own a piece of a Pablo Picasso. Here's how to enter the fine art market'Hold onto your money': Jeff Bezos says you might want to rethink buying a 'new automobile, refrigerator, or whatever' — here are 3 better recession-proof buysAmericans are paying nearly 40% more on home insurance compared to 12 years ago — here's how to spend less on peace of mindEmployers responding to tight labor marketThe tech industry in particular has been struggling with a talent shortage since pre-pandemic times.Google and 150 other companies use the tech giant’s online college-alternative program to train and hire entry-level workers, reports The Wall Street Journal. And according to CNBC, IBM doesn’t ask for a bachelor’s degree for half of its U.S. roles.Bank of America also doesn’t request college degrees for most of its entry-level jobs, while Delta says degrees for pilot applicants are “preferred” but not required.Story continuesAnd applicants for thousands of government jobs in the state of Maryland no longer need a bachelor’s degree — instead, they can submit any relevant work experience, military training or other educational certificates.This shift arrives during a thriving labor market with low unemployment and high job vacancies. And although there’s been talk of that coming to an end, the Labor Department’s latest jobs report indicated that hiring slowed only slightly in November, with 263,000 jobs added last month, compared to 284,000 jobs in October.Modestino adds there’s precedent for this approach. During the Great Recession, employers responded by focusing on skill requirements in addition to educational requirements since there were more college-educated workers available to them.It may not be an actual ‘culture shift’So should parents stop putting cash away for their kids’ college tuition? Modestino is “pessimistic” about whether big employers relaxing their educational credential requirements is truly part of a “culture shift.”And with recent shifts in the economy, she has concerns about the future of work.“Looking at where we are in terms of the business cycle and what the Fed’s doing with interest rates, [there’s] the potential for us to overshoot and tip into a recession,” Modestino warns.Read more: The 10 best investing apps for 'once-in-a-generation' opportunities (even if you're a beginner)The Fed raised its federal funds rate for the seventh time this year and more hikes are expected to arrive in 2023. Experts like Modestino worry this could trigger a recession, which would mean a slowdown in hiring and potential job and salary cuts.Modestino advised her own son — who has a bachelor’s degree in criminal justice — that he needs to capitalize on the hot job market and get on a career path.“We don't know if it’s going to be a soft landing in the labor market in the next six months,” she says. “So I would certainly urge any young people … that now's the time to make those decisions. Because I do worry that the window’s closing on those opportunities.”She anticipates that when workers are plentiful again and employers have many applications to sift through, many companies will “revert back to the lowest common denominator” when they’re hiring — a four-year college degree.So, is getting a bachelor’s degree actually worth it?Parents may have long encouraged their kids to pursue higher education, but Modestino points out that there are many jobs that don’t require a four-year college degree. And so making that big decision about whether to go to college should depend more on the young person’s career goals.For example, you don’t need a bachelor’s degree to become a phlebotomist, but it’ll likely require a certification in phlebotomy. On the other hand, a PhD is necessary to become a tenured college professor.That said, having more credentials can look good on a resume and open doors for inexperienced workers — especially when job opportunities aren’t as abundant and employers can afford to be choosy.In a recession or weaker labor market, having an academic credential to your name can often have a “sheepskin effect,” Modestino says — an economic phenomenon where employers pay higher wages to workers with degrees.A study from Georgetown University found that bachelor’s degree holders earn 31% more than those with an associate’s degree and 84% more than someone with a high school diploma. But higher education doesn’t always equate to higher earnings.“When you're in a labor market like this, we've seen wages actually rising faster at the bottom because they're so desperate for talent. And so [employers are] actually trying to hire on talent and reward on talent, rather than just a credential,” explains Modestino.But keep in mind that students pay a price for that extra earning potential. With about 43 million borrowers in the U.S. who owe over $1.6 trillion in student debt, getting a degree isn’t always worth the financial burden. Parents pushing their kids to get higher education just for the sake of it might want to have a bigger conversation about whose interests they’re prioritizing.“There's been this message for at least the last two decades that college is the only pathway,” says Modestino.“That's been a disservice, I think, to some young people who would have been better off going to a vocational technical school or taking a different pathway through workforce training and development.”What to read nextYou could be the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods and Kroger (and collect fat grocery store-anchored income on a quarterly basis)Here are 3 easy money moves to give your bank account a boost todayRich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these assets instead.

41,cdf92489-67c2-3754-934a-b4947b041d5a,IBM,2022-12-25,Is There An Opportunity With International Business Machines Corporation's (NYSE:IBM) 24% Undervaluation?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opportunity-international-business-machines-corporations-140018436.html,1671890418,STORY,['IBM'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for International Business Machines The MethodWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.7bUS$11.2bUS$11.6bUS$12.0bUS$12.3bUS$12.7bUS$13.0bUS$13.3bUS$13.6bUS$13.8bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 3.74%Est @ 3.21%Est @ 2.84%Est @ 2.58%Est @ 2.40%Est @ 2.28%Est @ 2.19%Est @ 2.12% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.7% US$9.8kUS$9.5kUS$9.0kUS$8.6kUS$8.1kUS$7.7kUS$7.2kUS$6.8kUS$6.4kUS$6.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$79bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.7%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$14b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.7%– 2.0%) = US$209bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$209b÷ ( 1 + 8.7%)10= US$90bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$169b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$142, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 24% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at International Business Machines as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.214. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for International Business MachinesStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Dividends are not covered by earnings.Annual revenue is forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

(NYSE:PNC) institutional owners must be relieved by the recent gain",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/losing-19-past-pnc-financial-140041686.html,1671890441,STORY,['PNC'],"[A look at the shareholders of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (NYSE:PNC) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 84% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).After a year of 19% losses, last week’s 3.1% gain would be welcomed by institutional investors as a likely sign that returns might start trending higher.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about PNC Financial Services Group. Check out our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About PNC Financial Services Group?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.We can see that PNC Financial Services Group does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at PNC Financial Services Group's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in PNC Financial Services Group. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.3%. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.6% of common stock, and Capital Research and Management Company holds about 7.3% of the company stock.Story continuesLooking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 50% of the ownership is controlled by the top 16 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of PNC Financial Services GroupThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$213m of stock. In this sort of situation, it can be more interesting to  see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 15% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over PNC Financial Services Group. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand PNC Financial Services Group better, we need to consider many other factors.

(NYSE:RCL) can tell us which group is most powerful. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 76% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And so it follows that institutional investors was the group most impacted after the company's market cap fell to US$13b last week after a 6.8% drop in the share price. This set of investors may especially be concerned about the current loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 37% for shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. As a result, if the downtrend continues, institutions may face pressures to sell Royal Caribbean Cruises, which might have negative implications on individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Royal Caribbean Cruises. View our latest analysis for Royal Caribbean Cruises ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Royal Caribbean Cruises?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Royal Caribbean Cruises already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Royal Caribbean Cruises' earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Royal Caribbean Cruises is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is Capital Research and Management Company with 21% of shares outstanding. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 9.3% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 6.3% by the third-largest shareholder.On further inspection, we found that more than half the company's shares are owned by the top 6 shareholders, suggesting that the interests of the larger shareholders are balanced out to an extent by the smaller ones.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Royal Caribbean CruisesThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. in their own names. We do note, however, it is possible insiders have an indirect interest through a private company or other corporate structure. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$64m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 13% stake in Royal Caribbean Cruises. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Private Equity OwnershipWith an ownership of 6.3%, private equity firms are in a position to play a role in shaping corporate strategy with a focus on value creation. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public.Private Company OwnershipWe can see that Private Companies own 4.5%, of the shares on issue. It's hard to draw any conclusions from this fact alone, so its worth looking into who owns those private companies. Sometimes insiders or other related parties have an interest in shares in a public company through a separate private company.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Be aware that  Royal Caribbean Cruises is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Ultimately the future is most important.

(NASDAQ:ADI) insiders disposed of US$5.5m worth of stock",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-analog-devices-110040435.html,1671966040,STORY,['ADI'],"[The fact that multiple Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Analog Devices The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Analog DevicesThe Executive Vice President of Global Operations &amp; Technology, Vivek Jain, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.3m worth of shares at a price of US$166 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$164. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Insiders in Analog Devices didn't buy any shares in the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Analog Devices Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Analog Devices. In total, insiders dumped US$2.3m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Does Analog Devices Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Analog Devices insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$282m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The Analog Devices Insider Transactions Indicate?Insiders haven't bought Analog Devices stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that Analog Devices is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 1 warning sign for Analog Devices you should be aware of.If you would prefer to check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the robotics industry and go directly to 5 Most Advanced Countries in Robotics. Robotics refers to the design, manufacturing and utilization of robots for tasks (in hardware and software) that have traditionally been performed by humans. A Robot TakeoverAutomation has been one of the most noteworthy trends in the world, with 31% businesses having fully automated at-least one business function as of 2020, according to McKinsey. Additionally, businesses that had no plans to automate operations were reduced to 16% in 2020, from 20% in 2018. Further, according to the World Economic Forum, more than half of the jobs in the workflow will be performed by robots and algorithms by 2025. Conventional wisdom suggests that robot-takeover of jobs won’t bode well for human workers. However, it has been argued that the reverse is true, with robots reducing humanity’s physical and mental labor while creating new jobs in the process. The World Economic Forum forecasts suggest that automation will create 97 million new jobs for humans by 2025.Driving FactorsRobotics offers various advantages in the workflow including consistent product/service quality in manufacturing, reduction in operating costs and lead times, and higher production output and efficiency.  Another key driving factor is long-term adaptation to the aging human population. In 2020, the number of people who were 60 years or older, outnumbered children that were less than 5 years of age. Those aged 65 or above, comprised 1 in 11 people in the world in 2019. Their population is projected to reach 1.5 billion in 2050, per the UN figures, with every 1 in 6 people being 65 years or older. Automation and robotics will play an important role to compensate for the availability of fewer people of working age in the coming decades. In fact, the future is being played out in Japan, where people who are aged 65 years or older, make up 29% of the country’s population as of 2021. This has led Japan to early-adopt robotics and automation to remain competitive, with 631 robots for every 10,000 humans in the workforce in the country.Story continuesThe necessity of automation has also made Japan pretty much a superpower in robotics. The country is the largest manufacturer and exporter of industrial robots in 2022. Robotics Industry OutlookThe global robotics market is projected to reach $215 billion in value by 2030, growing at a solid CAGR of 23% according to Market Research Future. The industrial automation market, on the other hand, is much bigger but largely overlaps with the robotics market.According to Precedence Research, the automation industry was valued at $197 billion in 2021 and is estimated to expand at a CAGR of 8.59%, to a market value of $413 billion by 2030. Major players in the two sibling industries include Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK), Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX), Boston Dynamics, Fanuc Corporation (TOKYO:6954.T), Seiko Epson Corporation (TOKYO:6724.T) and Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM). Some of the leading countries in robotics are Japan, Singapore and the US. Below, we list the 12 most advanced countries in robotics.  Most Advanced Countries in RoboticsOur MethodologyFor our list of the most advanced countries in robotics, we’ve ranked them based on their technology scene in robotics as well as their level of automation. We’ve used data from the International Federation of Robotics, especially for the robot density in the manufacturing workforce. Here are the 12 most advanced nations in robotics.12. ChinaChina, like other East Asian countries, is one of the most advanced countries in robotics. According to data from the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), the Chinese market added over 240,000 new robot units in 2021, an increase of 44% as compared to the year 2020. The country had 187 robots working in the manufacturing sector for every 10,000 humans in the same year. This suggests that a significant number of factories in China have implemented automation technologies, including industrial robots, in their operations.Automation in the country is covering for the labor shortage due to an aging population while also creating new jobs. For instance, 18 professions were announced by the Chinese Ministry for Human Resources and Social Security. One of these included the ‘Robotics Engineering Technician’, a job for R&amp;D in control algorithms and operating systems for robots. Siasun Robot&amp;Automation Co.,Ltd. (SHENZHEN:300024.SZ) is one of the leading robotics companies in China.11. The NetherlandsThe Netherlands is located in Northwestern Europe. It is known for high levels of automation as well as numerous robotics companies. As of 2021, the country’s robot density in the manufacturing workflow is 224 robots for every 10,000 human workers, according to the International Federation of Robotics.The Netherlands is one of the pioneers in the most advanced robotics systems to date and is producing leading research from institutes like Radboud University. The country is also implementing AI and robotics technology to modernize industries like Agriculture, with its Wageningen UR being the top institute innovating in robotics for agriculture. 10. DenmarkDenmark is a European country in the Scandinavian region. It is one of the most developed countries in terms of science, technology, GDP per Capita and other indicators. As of 2021, Denmark has 234 robots in the manufacturing-sector workforce for every 10,000 humans. One of the key players in the Danish robotics industry is the Danish Technological Institute, which conducts research and development in a wide range of areas related to robotics and automation, including collaborative robots, service robots, and manufacturing automation. The institute also works closely with industry partners and has a number of commercial projects in development.Another important player in the Danish robotics industry is Universal Robots, a leading manufacturer of collaborative robots (also known as cobots). Based in Odense, Denmark, the company has developed a range of cobots that are used in a variety of applications, including assembly, welding, packaging, and material handling.9. SwitzerlandSwitzerland is ninth on the list of most advanced countries in robotics. There are 240 robots for every 10,000 human workers in the manufacturing industry in the country as of 2021. It is also home to some of the most noteworthy robotics companies in the world, like ANYbotics. Some of the key players in the robotics industry in Switzerland include ABB, which is a global leader in industrial robotics and automation, and Swisslog, which specializes in logistics automation solutions.Switzerland is also home to a number of research institutions and universities that are actively involved in robotics research and development. These include the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich, which has a well-recognized robotics program. 8. SwedenSweden is another one of the most advanced countries when it comes to robotics. As of 2021, there are 321 robots per 10,000 humans in the manufacturing labor-force in the country.Sweden has a number of research institutions and universities that are involved in automation R&amp;D. These include the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, which has a renowned automation program, and the Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, which has a strong focus on automation and control systems.Sweden made headlines for Eve, a lab robot that is extensively used in automating research processes in the country. Apart from its own robotics companies, Sweden also benefits from the presence of American companies like Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK), Cognex Corporation (NYSE:CGNX) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).7. United StatesThe United States is one of the most advanced western nations in robotics. Its robots to human workers ratio is lower than Germany’s, at 274 robots per 10,000 humans, but the country makes up for it with advanced robotics technology.Some of the top tech corporations in the US like Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Rockwell Automation, Inc. (NYSE:ROK) and Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX) are highly focused on robotics.Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) primarily develops high-end GPUs, which have been found to have many applications for robotics and machine learning. Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) and Cognex Corporation (NASDAQ:CGNX), on the other hand, are two of the premier automation companies in the US with a global presence. There has been a record adoption of industrial robots in the US in the past decade. In 2019, however, the trend started slowing down and the decline continued well into 2020, with 8% fewer installations than the previous year. The slow down can largely be attributed to the pandemic and factory closures due to lockdowns. 6. Hong Kong, SARHong Kong has an advanced manufacturing and research infrastructure, which the country has used to advance in robotics among many other fields. There are 304 robots in Hong Kong for every 10,000 human workers as of 2021. Given its population, the number of robots amounts to over 224,000.Insight Robotics and Rehab Robotics are two of the most prominent robotics startups in Hong Kong. The small nation also hosts Hanson Robotics, the designer and manufacturer of Sophia, the Robot.Click to continue reading and see 5 Most Advanced Countries in Robotics.

Per its public profile, Travelers is the second-largest writer of U.S. commercial property casualty insurance, and the sixth-largest writer of U.S. personal insurance through independent agents. What this all translates to is that the enterprise enjoys inelastic demand.Basically, no matter potential pricing fluctuations or shifting economic dynamics, Travelers will enjoy consistent and predictable demand. Further, the coronavirus pandemic imposed a sharp lesson on the American populace: anything and everything can happen as we realized the world’s a lot smaller than we thought it was. Therefore, people have an even greater incentive to protect themselves.To be fair, some economic forces may be so severe that they may dissuade even the purchase of critical insurance policies. However, such a draconian scenario may be unlikely. Sure enough, bullish investors recognize the realistic thesis undergirding TRV. On a year-to-date basis, shares gained over 19%, almost the exact inverse of the benchmark equities index.Story continuesStocks to Buy: Allstate (ALL)Allstate Insurance officeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comShould the Fed continue to hit the accelerator on its hawkish monetary policy, your stocks to buy should concentrate on insurance plays such as Allstate (NYSE:ALL). As with Travelers Companies above, Wall Street recognizes the cynical opportunity in ALL stock. Since the start of the year, shares moved up 13%, a very respectable figure given the extraordinary circumstances.Moving forward, investors should keep close tabs on the insurance provider. Essentially, stocks to buy in the insurance field share a direct, linear relationship with benchmark interest rates. As rates move higher, so too does the valuation of insurance-based securities. While it’s not a guaranteed outcome, the relationship is generally dependable.Further, the smart money also recognizes the protective opportunity in ALL stock. While numbers fluctuate quarter to quarter, since the third quarter of 2021, hedge funds dramatically increased their exposure to Allstate. I don’t think that’s a coincidence given the aforementioned linear relationship with rising rates.Stocks to Buy: Lowe’s (LOW)A New Lowe’s Companies, Inc. CEO Could Be Just Enough of a TweakSource: ShutterstockColloquially, Murphy’s Law states that anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Given that this dynamic may rear its ugly head during a recession – which is exactly where the economy might head if rates continue to skyrocket higher – investors ought to focus their stocks to buy on acquiring shares of Lowe’s  (NYSE:LOW). A major home improvement retailer, Lowe’s offers impregnable relevance.Basically, no matter what happens in the economy, people need to repair and renovate their living spaces. Further, your plumbing doesn’t care whether you’re suffering from a recession or not. If the system decides it’s going to fail, it’s going to fail. Therefore, an enterprise like Lowe’s provides some reassurances for embattled consumers.To be fair, LOW stock made good on its ticker name this year, shedding more than 21% YTD. However, an unignorable development exists. Since Q3 2021, the smart money – the hedge funds – began building their position in Lowe’s Companies.Stocks to Buy: Dominion Energy (D)a truck bearing the Dominion Energy logoSource: ying / Shutterstock.comIf you want one of the best stocks to buy for rising interest rates, it’s difficult to ignore Dominion Energy (NYSE:D). To be fair, Dominion won’t immediately attractive conservative investors. Since the beginning of this year, D stock gave up 24% of equity value. In addition, the back half of the year has been rough. During the trailing half-year period, Dominion shed 20%.As if to pour salt on open wounds, TipRanks notes that the power and energy utility firm has a consensus hold rating. This breaks down to two buys, 11 holds and one sell. That’s not exactly an encouraging assessment. Worse yet, hedge funds remain unconvinced about Dominion. Presently, TipRanks states that sentiment among these institutional investors is negative.However, the naysayers seem to be missing the point. Should rates rise, discretionary spending will likely decline because of higher borrowing costs. On the other hand, the essentials – such as utility bills – must be paid no matter what. Thus, D stock enjoys a cynical upside catalyst.Costco (COST)Costco Stock May Be the Market’s Top Recession PickSource: ShutterstockAs I just mentioned, higher interest rates tend to pressure discretionary spending due to higher borrowing costs. In arguably most cases, this circumstance would impugn the upside mobility of retailers. However, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) represents a different breed. It’s not just because it offers consumer staples such as food and water (or other beverages). Rather, it enjoys a higher-income consumer demographic.According to data cited by Business Insider, your typical Costco shopper is younger and generates an income over $100,000. Presumably, such a high average income indicates higher educational attainment and/or owning valuable skills. In other words, the average Costco shopper will be able to absorb higher rates. And she will be able to absorb the side effects of higher rates, such as a recession.In this case, Wall Street analysts get why COST ranks as one of the stocks to buy. Presently, Costco features a moderate buy consensus view with 17 buys, seven holds and most importantly, no sells.Whirlpool (WHR)image of businessman holding a fiery arrow that's heading in an upward trajectorySource: ShutterstockPrior to writing this list of stocks to buy, I had a choice to make. Do I saturate this list with insurance and utility providers or do I get a bit adventurous? Since I’ve already given you the meat and potatoes of rising-rate insulant names, I’ll dedicate the next two slots with speculative market ideas. First up is appliance manufacturer Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR).At first glance, WHR does not appear to be a candidate for stocks to buy. Really, I can understand people think it’s one of the securities to sell. Since the start of the year, WHR dropped a staggering 41% of equity value. Moreover, Wall Street’s best and brightest do in fact peg Whirlpool as a consensus moderate sell.However, if you think three dimensionally, WHR might be a surprising idea for stocks to buy for higher rates. As you know, appliances represent necessities in the modern age. When they break down, it may be more cost-effective to replace them (instead of repairing them).Well, with millions of white-collar workers operating remotely, home appliances collectively received an unexpected workout. Eventually, that wear and tear will catch up, perhaps within 2023.Truist Financial (TFC)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Generally speaking, I avoided mentioning banks and similar financial institutions for stocks to buy ahead of rising rates. On paper, higher interest rates bode well for banks. After all, they can charge more for their loan packages, improving profitability. However, fewer entities would be willing to borrow money precisely because said rates skyrocketed. Still, I’ll make an exception this case for Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC).Unlike a major multinational banking giant – I won’t mention specific names – Truist concentrates as a regional player. Per its public profile, the company operates 2,781 branches in 15 states and Washington, D.C. Truist is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. Coincidentally, the Tar Heel State features cities that attract plenty of interest from millennials. Stated differently, Truist operates in a region where the money will be spent, not where it was spent.Currently, TipRanks notes that TFC enjoys a moderate buy consensus rating. Among 13 analysts, six of them rate shares a buy while the remaining seven rate it a hold.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

55,a83fcf49-8aff-36c1-8077-06b58538c79e,FOX,2022-12-25,15 Most Hated Companies in America,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/15-most-hated-companies-america-230921187.html,1671923361,STORY,"['NFLX', 'BP', 'AMZN', 'CMCSA', 'FOXA', 'XOM', 'JNJ', 'AIG', 'WMT', 'UBER']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 15 most hated companies in America. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most hated companies in America.In an ideal world, companies would be supported by the general population. After all, the economy of a country defines its standard of living, and the economy of a country is propped up by the major industries in the nation. And these industries are defined by the companies within each industry. After all, companies provide innovation, ideas and solutions that people need. If they didn't, they would soon be out of business. They also provide employment to the working force of a country. So why is it that most people hate corporations?Many corporations in the world, and especially the bigger ones, are disliked strongly by the general population because people believe that these companies exist for one purpose and one purpose alone: to maximize profits no matter what the cost. Even though these companies earn billions of dollars in profits each year, people believe that they do not contribute in any positive way and continue to cut costs in order to increase profit even more. This ends up benefiting only a select few such as the executives of the company and shareholders. Meanwhile, employees are sometimes overworked and underpaid, not to mention made to work in harsh conditions. Many people also hate corporations because they believe that such companies take from the country but do not provide much in return and so, they are actually a detriment.15 most hated companies in AmericaStock-Asso/Shutterstock.comYou might think that this hatred would translate to a negative impact on the company's financials and hence, its success but the discussion isn't as straightforward as you might believe. Some of the most successful companies in the world are also among the most hated primarily because of their success, and yet they do genuinely make the life of customers easier. For example, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been derided time and again for its treatment of workers, and considering the fact that there are 1.5 million workers in the company, this is an important fact to consider. However, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has made the life of consumers really easy, providing instant delivery or next-day delivery in many cases while also providing the cheapest price possible for many products, excellent customer service and a great return policy. When the lives of people are made easier, they often compromise on their beliefs.Story continuesAnother reason behind companies not suffering despite widespread hatred is because there aren't many alternatives. Take the U.S. for example. While there are anti-trust laws established to ensure competition, and there are many examples of mergers not being allowed to avoid monopolies, with the attempted merger of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) being a recent example, there are effective monopolies in some industries which has led to them being the only possible solution, no matter how poor their customer service is or no matter how many outrageous fees they tack on. Some of these companies are part of the most hated countries in America and we will discuss them in greater detail later on.It is interesting to note that just because a company is among our list of the most hated companies in America, it doesn't mean that it's universally hated. After all, maybe 10% of the population hates a specific company but maybe 30% of the population loves it. Since we're only focusing on the former criteria, it would feature in our list even though more people love it than hate it and so, being in this list doesn't mean that the company is doomed. Take Meta Platforms Inc. (META) for example. It is hated by a ton of people due to privacy concerns, data leaks and its influence on everyone, but it still has 2 billion active monthly users, and so, is nowhere near finished. Meanwhile, financial corporations such as The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is hated by most of the public but the company mainly deals with other companies and wealthy clients so public perception doesn't really hurt its bottom line. For companies which operate on a B2B model (business to business), public perception doesn't matter as much as for B2C companies (business to consumer).Of course, this doesn't mean that there are no repercussions to a company if they fail the general public. Nowadays, profits and revenue alone aren't sufficient to determine the success of the company: Environmental, social and governance (ESG) is just as important and is the biggest challenge for companies to overcome if they want to continue the level of success that they've enjoyed, or even increase it. According to PwC, itself one of the largest firms in the world, mentioned that social capital is incredibly relevant to the success of a business now. Social capital refers to the impact of the decisions taken by a business on people. According to PwC, it ""describes the stocks of knowledge, skills, experience, health and wellbeing within people; as well as the stocks of relationships, institutions, shared values and norms that exist between people. Just like other forms of capital, social capital can be increased or decreased by the ‘flows’ of social capital - the social impacts - which result from business activity."" If a business operates properly with the general well-being of society being a primary focus, it will achieve success quickly. Of course, this always has to be balanced with revenue and profitability, but the point is that both need to go hand in hand for a business to be truly successful.Speaking of audit firms, the audit industry has seen its fair share of criticism too, especially in recent year. There have been a series of high-profile failures in audit which has put the industry under scrutiny, with record fines administered to some audit firms which has resulted in the Financial Reporting Council in the United Kingdom to announce plans to overhaul corporate governance. Audit firms also see heavy workload with tight deadlines and often do not have adequate staff, resulting in high pressure for employees which in turn results in a high level of turnover, all of which are detrimental to the health of an employee as well as impacting their performance. This is a trend in audit firms throughout the world and audit firms, while taking steps in some countries, should ensure more global policies to create a proper work-life for employees.You can also consider the pharmaceutical industry as an entire industry which is disliked by the general public. Conspiracy theorists have come up with the term ""Big Pharma"" which refers to major pharmaceutical organizations with conspiracy theories alleging that the executives of these companies collude to keep medical breakthroughs from reaching the public while also citing price hikes as a way for companies to make even higher profits at the expense of the health of the general public. This reputation has seen a massive improvement in recent years as these companies worked hard to come up with a vaccine for the worst pandemic in a century, helping to avert millions of deaths and tens of millions of serious illnesses across the world.For our rankings of the most hated companies, we polled the rankings published by various other websites including 24/7 Wall Street, TheStreet.com, Bloomberg, Business Insider and Fast Company, giving precedence to companies which made multiple lists. Basically, our article reflects the approximate consensus opinion of the financial media. Some of these rankings are as old as 10 years as we intentionally picked rankings that span a long period of time. This way we are more likely to identify the companies that are consistently out of favor with the general public and the media. So now, let's take a look at the most hated companies in the America, companies which need to work hard to regain public trust, starting with number 15:15. American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG)American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) earned the ire of the general public when normal people lost their life savings and employment in the 2008 recession, while it was bailed out by the Federal Government to the tune of $180 billion and announced payments of $165 million in executive bonuses alone. In a display of rare unity, both Democrats and Republicans voiced their anger at this announcement by American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG), with even President Obama commenting on whether such a bonus was deserved at all.14. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of times mentioned: 2Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue but has faced significant controversy regarding its operations. While Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) received praised in 1982 for a nationwide recall of Tylenol after some packages of the drug had been laced with cyanide, it has garnered significant criticism based on lawsuits that its baby powder causes ovarian cancer, with damages in billions of dollars being decided against the company.13. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX)Number of times mentioned: 2Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) owns Fox News, which is the main basis for the hatred it receives. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) is criticized for only providing views sympathetic to the Republican party, and the bias present in its coverage. We believe this is a brilliant business strategy as most of the media companies stand to the left of the political spectrum.12. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of times mentioned: 2Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been a people favorite for a long time, growing massively over a short period of time. However, hatred for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has started to increase mainly because of price increases and the company pledging to crack down on multiple people using the same account. We don't think Netflix's presence in our list of the most hated companies in the US points to a negative outcome for the company or its shareholders.11. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of times mentioned: 2The ride-hailing company has over 122 million monthly users, but it has received criticism for its treatment of its drivers as gig workers. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is also disliked because of its disruption of the taxicab industry and contribution in traffic congestion. We don't think UBER deserves to be one of the ""most hated companies"" as its services addressed a massive problem for consumers who have trouble hailing a cab and getting almost anything to be delivered to their doors. UBER will probably find itself a place in an extended version of our ""most innovative companies"" article.10. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Number of times mentioned: 2Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is widely criticized for its monopoly in many areas where alternates aren't present and the difficulty customers face if they want to cancel the service. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is also derided for extremely poor customer service. The Consumerist dubbed Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) the worst company in America in 2010 and 2014.9. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of times mentioned: 2Our list could've consisted entirely of oil companies, considering how maligned they are in the eyes of the public but we settled for just two. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been accused of being aware of the contribution of fossil fuels to climate change but provided false information to investors to prop up its share price. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was also accused of hiring military units of the Indonesian National Army to provide protection to the company's assets in the country, with these units being accused of human rights violations. Exxon Mobil is also still remembered because of the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster.Overall, though, we don't think XOM's presence in the ""most hated companies"" lists affects its business materially as consumers don't really prefer one oil company over another.8. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of times mentioned: 2One of the largest banking institutions in America, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was accused of misrepresenting its exposure to Enron after the collapse of the latter. Further, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) paid $75 million in 2010 after charges were brought against the company stating that investors were misled with respect to potential losses arising from risky mortgages. Yes, we know, it is a tiny fine. Regulators fixed their mistake in 2014 as the bank agreed to pay $7 billion to resolve a Department of Justice investigation into its sale of toxic mortgage-backed securities leading up to the financial crisis.In 2018, Citigroup also agreed to pay $1 billion to settle charges brought by the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve that it had violated the Bank Secrecy Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by failing to properly monitor transactions that potentially violated U.S. sanctions.7. BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP)Number of times mentioned: 2BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) is one of the biggest oil companies in the world, and in 2010, was responsible for the worst oil spill in global history in what is now known as the Deepwater Horizon Spill. While the spill ended up costing BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) around $65 billion, this has led to the general public hating the company. The oil spill disaster affected BP's business for a few years, but we don't think it is material anymore.6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of times mentioned: 2Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is the largest private employer in the world with over 2 million employees, most of whom are being accused of being treated unfairly by the largest company in the world by revenue. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is also disliked because in many places, it has swooped in and destroyed local businesses, leaving customers no other options. That's a consequence of the success of its business model. Consumers love Walmart and prefer to shop there, just like they love Amazon.com (AMZN) even though Amazon drove several competitors out of business.Click to continue reading and see the 5 most hated companies in America. Suggested articles:15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks to Buy10 Best ASX Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 15 most hated companies in America is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$109 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$85.78. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Walt Disney's current trading price of US$88.01 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Walt Disney’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. View our latest analysis for Walt Disney Is Walt Disney Still Cheap?Good news, investors! Walt Disney is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $141.64, which is above what the market is valuing the company at the moment. This indicates a potential opportunity to buy low. What’s more interesting is that, Walt Disney’s share price is quite volatile, which gives us more chances to buy since the share price could sink lower (or rise higher) in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Walt Disney look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to more than double over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Walt Disney. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since DIS is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on DIS for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its buoyant future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy DIS. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed investment decision.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 most hated companies in America.In an ideal world, companies would be supported by the general population. After all, the economy of a country defines its standard of living, and the economy of a country is propped up by the major industries in the nation. And these industries are defined by the companies within each industry. After all, companies provide innovation, ideas and solutions that people need. If they didn't, they would soon be out of business. They also provide employment to the working force of a country. So why is it that most people hate corporations?Many corporations in the world, and especially the bigger ones, are disliked strongly by the general population because people believe that these companies exist for one purpose and one purpose alone: to maximize profits no matter what the cost.

This ends up benefiting only a select few such as the executives of the company and shareholders.

Many people also hate corporations because they believe that such companies take from the country but do not provide much in return and so, they are actually a detriment.15 most hated companies in AmericaStock-Asso/Shutterstock.comYou might think that this hatred would translate to a negative impact on the company's financials and hence, its success but the discussion isn't as straightforward as you might believe. Some of the most successful companies in the world are also among the most hated primarily because of their success, and yet they do genuinely make the life of customers easier. For example, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been derided time and again for its treatment of workers, and considering the fact that there are 1.5 million workers in the company, this is an important fact to consider. However, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has made the life of consumers really easy, providing instant delivery or next-day delivery in many cases while also providing the cheapest price possible for many products, excellent customer service and a great return policy. When the lives of people are made easier, they often compromise on their beliefs.Story continuesAnother reason behind companies not suffering despite widespread hatred is because there aren't many alternatives. Take the U.S. for example. While there are anti-trust laws established to ensure competition, and there are many examples of mergers not being allowed to avoid monopolies, with the attempted merger of Activision Blizzard, Inc. (NASDAQ:ATVI) with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) being a recent example, there are effective monopolies in some industries which has led to them being the only possible solution, no matter how poor their customer service is or no matter how many outrageous fees they tack on. Some of these companies are part of the most hated countries in America and we will discuss them in greater detail later on.It is interesting to note that just because a company is among our list of the most hated companies in America, it doesn't mean that it's universally hated. After all, maybe 10% of the population hates a specific company but maybe 30% of the population loves it. Since we're only focusing on the former criteria, it would feature in our list even though more people love it than hate it and so, being in this list doesn't mean that the company is doomed. Take Meta Platforms Inc. (META) for example. It is hated by a ton of people due to privacy concerns, data leaks and its influence on everyone, but it still has 2 billion active monthly users, and so, is nowhere near finished. Meanwhile, financial corporations such as The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is hated by most of the public but the company mainly deals with other companies and wealthy clients so public perception doesn't really hurt its bottom line. For companies which operate on a B2B model (business to business), public perception doesn't matter as much as for B2C companies (business to consumer).Of course, this doesn't mean that there are no repercussions to a company if they fail the general public. Nowadays, profits and revenue alone aren't sufficient to determine the success of the company: Environmental, social and governance (ESG) is just as important and is the biggest challenge for companies to overcome if they want to continue the level of success that they've enjoyed, or even increase it. According to PwC, itself one of the largest firms in the world, mentioned that social capital is incredibly relevant to the success of a business now. Social capital refers to the impact of the decisions taken by a business on people. According to PwC, it ""describes the stocks of knowledge, skills, experience, health and wellbeing within people; as well as the stocks of relationships, institutions, shared values and norms that exist between people. Just like other forms of capital, social capital can be increased or decreased by the ‘flows’ of social capital - the social impacts - which result from business activity."" If a business operates properly with the general well-being of society being a primary focus, it will achieve success quickly. Of course, this always has to be balanced with revenue and profitability, but the point is that both need to go hand in hand for a business to be truly successful.Speaking of audit firms, the audit industry has seen its fair share of criticism too, especially in recent year. There have been a series of high-profile failures in audit which has put the industry under scrutiny, with record fines administered to some audit firms which has resulted in the Financial Reporting Council in the United Kingdom to announce plans to overhaul corporate governance. Audit firms also see heavy workload with tight deadlines and often do not have adequate staff, resulting in high pressure for employees which in turn results in a high level of turnover, all of which are detrimental to the health of an employee as well as impacting their performance. This is a trend in audit firms throughout the world and audit firms, while taking steps in some countries, should ensure more global policies to create a proper work-life for employees.You can also consider the pharmaceutical industry as an entire industry which is disliked by the general public. Conspiracy theorists have come up with the term ""Big Pharma"" which refers to major pharmaceutical organizations with conspiracy theories alleging that the executives of these companies collude to keep medical breakthroughs from reaching the public while also citing price hikes as a way for companies to make even higher profits at the expense of the health of the general public. This reputation has seen a massive improvement in recent years as these companies worked hard to come up with a vaccine for the worst pandemic in a century, helping to avert millions of deaths and tens of millions of serious illnesses across the world.For our rankings of the most hated companies, we polled the rankings published by various other websites including 24/7 Wall Street, TheStreet.com, Bloomberg, Business Insider and Fast Company, giving precedence to companies which made multiple lists. Basically, our article reflects the approximate consensus opinion of the financial media. Some of these rankings are as old as 10 years as we intentionally picked rankings that span a long period of time. This way we are more likely to identify the companies that are consistently out of favor with the general public and the media. So now, let's take a look at the most hated companies in the America, companies which need to work hard to regain public trust, starting with number 15:15. American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG)American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG) earned the ire of the general public when normal people lost their life savings and employment in the 2008 recession, while it was bailed out by the Federal Government to the tune of $180 billion and announced payments of $165 million in executive bonuses alone. In a display of rare unity, both Democrats and Republicans voiced their anger at this announcement by American International Group, Inc. (NYSE:AIG), with even President Obama commenting on whether such a bonus was deserved at all.14. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of times mentioned: 2Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is the biggest pharmaceutical company in the world by revenue but has faced significant controversy regarding its operations. While Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) received praised in 1982 for a nationwide recall of Tylenol after some packages of the drug had been laced with cyanide, it has garnered significant criticism based on lawsuits that its baby powder causes ovarian cancer, with damages in billions of dollars being decided against the company.13. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX)Number of times mentioned: 2Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) owns Fox News, which is the main basis for the hatred it receives. Fox Corporation (NASDAQ:FOX) is criticized for only providing views sympathetic to the Republican party, and the bias present in its coverage. We believe this is a brilliant business strategy as most of the media companies stand to the left of the political spectrum.12. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of times mentioned: 2Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been a people favorite for a long time, growing massively over a short period of time. However, hatred for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) has started to increase mainly because of price increases and the company pledging to crack down on multiple people using the same account. We don't think Netflix's presence in our list of the most hated companies in the US points to a negative outcome for the company or its shareholders.11. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of times mentioned: 2The ride-hailing company has over 122 million monthly users, but it has received criticism for its treatment of its drivers as gig workers. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is also disliked because of its disruption of the taxicab industry and contribution in traffic congestion. We don't think UBER deserves to be one of the ""most hated companies"" as its services addressed a massive problem for consumers who have trouble hailing a cab and getting almost anything to be delivered to their doors. UBER will probably find itself a place in an extended version of our ""most innovative companies"" article.10. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA)Number of times mentioned: 2Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is one of the largest telecommunications companies in the world. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is widely criticized for its monopoly in many areas where alternates aren't present and the difficulty customers face if they want to cancel the service. Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) is also derided for extremely poor customer service. The Consumerist dubbed Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) the worst company in America in 2010 and 2014.9. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)Number of times mentioned: 2Our list could've consisted entirely of oil companies, considering how maligned they are in the eyes of the public but we settled for just two. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) has been accused of being aware of the contribution of fossil fuels to climate change but provided false information to investors to prop up its share price. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) was also accused of hiring military units of the Indonesian National Army to provide protection to the company's assets in the country, with these units being accused of human rights violations. Exxon Mobil is also still remembered because of the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster.Overall, though, we don't think XOM's presence in the ""most hated companies"" lists affects its business materially as consumers don't really prefer one oil company over another.8. Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C)Number of times mentioned: 2One of the largest banking institutions in America, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) was accused of misrepresenting its exposure to Enron after the collapse of the latter. Further, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) paid $75 million in 2010 after charges were brought against the company stating that investors were misled with respect to potential losses arising from risky mortgages. Yes, we know, it is a tiny fine. Regulators fixed their mistake in 2014 as the bank agreed to pay $7 billion to resolve a Department of Justice investigation into its sale of toxic mortgage-backed securities leading up to the financial crisis.In 2018, Citigroup also agreed to pay $1 billion to settle charges brought by the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve that it had violated the Bank Secrecy Act and the International Emergency Economic Powers Act by failing to properly monitor transactions that potentially violated U.S. sanctions.7. BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP)Number of times mentioned: 2BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) is one of the biggest oil companies in the world, and in 2010, was responsible for the worst oil spill in global history in what is now known as the Deepwater Horizon Spill. While the spill ended up costing BP p.l.c. (NYSE:BP) around $65 billion, this has led to the general public hating the company. The oil spill disaster affected BP's business for a few years, but we don't think it is material anymore.6. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT)Number of times mentioned: 2Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is the largest private employer in the world with over 2 million employees, most of whom are being accused of being treated unfairly by the largest company in the world by revenue. Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) is also disliked because in many places, it has swooped in and destroyed local businesses, leaving customers no other options. That's a consequence of the success of its business model. Consumers love Walmart and prefer to shop there, just like they love Amazon.com (AMZN) even though Amazon drove several competitors out of business.Click to continue reading and see the 5 most hated companies in America. Suggested articles:15 Biggest Nanotechnology Companies in the World11 Best Pet Stocks to Buy10 Best ASX Stocks to BuyDisclosure: None. 15 most hated companies in America is originally published at Insider Monkey.]"

However, there is cause for optimism, as signs of recovery are present this holiday season. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is down just 8% after being deep in the red for most of 2022. Therefore, it’s an ideal time for investors to think about investing in stocks to buy as Christmas gifts.After stocks and cryptos took such a shellacking this year, savvy investors have a great chance to benefit from some big gains in the future. The crypto winter has been long and harsh, but the bull cases for the industry stalwarts remain firmly intact. Having said that, here are seven top stocks and cryptos you should invest in as Christmas gifts this year.DISWalt Disney$87.76AAPLApple$135.40DVNDevon Energy$61.41BTCBitcoin$16,805.98ETHEthereum$1,210.75VTRSViatris$10.88ALBAlbemarle Corporation$234.06InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWalt Disney (DIS)Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.Source: chrisdorney / ShutterstockWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) has long been one of the most popular names in the entertainment sphere, but has gained even more attention lately due to the success of its streaming service, Disney+. It’s now become one of the most popular streaming services worldwide, with over 164 million subscribers. Moreover, some experts believe that Disney+ could potentially overtake Netflix as the top streaming service in the near future.What sets Disney apart from its peers is the diversity of its income sources. Its park and cruise line segments effectively shield it from any losses from its streaming service. After a painstaking lockdown period, we saw tourist numbers quickly flood back to the company’s global parks. Recently, it boasts a 90% occupancy rate during the third quarter. This additional cushioning from any potential bumps in the road provides Disney with much-needed peace of mind as it strives for more success in years to come.Story continuesApple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been one of the most popular Warren Buffet stocks since the Oracle of Omaha began building a massive stake in the company in 2016. As the world’s largest tech company, the firm remains one of the most valuable brands globally. Accordingly, investors have held on to Apple as a long-term investment. It boasts a spectacular track record of growing its top and bottom lines with its robust product base and services ecosystem.Investing in AAPL stock is also an attractive option for investors looking for dividend growth. With an annualized dividend of 92 cents currently and $122 billion in operating cash flows, a consistent dividend hike is expected to sustain over the next few years. These profits can fuel technology advancements, including 5G adoption and investment into Apple’s growing wearable, home and accessory segments.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comOklahoma City-based Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN) is one of the few stocks that has traded in the green this year. It is one of the biggest names in the oil industry and one of the biggest producers of natural gas and natural gas liquids. This is particularly appealing given Europe’s continued high demand for these particular energy products. Additionally, with its experienced management team and proven track record for efficient operations, now might be an opportune time to invest in this well-run business.Devon Energy is an incredible gift to dividend investors, offering an eye-catching forward annual yield of 9.1%. The company’s fixed-plus-variable dividend model has made it possible for investors to feel secure and create a steady income stream. Moreover, Devon Energy has remained resilient even as the price of oil has dropped significantly, demonstrating its long-term value to investors looking for reliable returns.Bitcoin (BTC)Dinosaur figurine holding a Bitcoin (BTC) concept coin between its teethSource: shutterstock.com/Maestro-0111Bitcoin (BTC-USD) is like a blue-chip investment in the crypto world. Though we have seen plenty of choppiness in its value this year, there’s plenty of reason to be optimistic about its long-term outlook. Inflation is slowly tapering off, and a weak dollar could create an even more favorable environment for investing in risky asset classes. Even though we might see another economic downturn in 2023, it could be a great opportunity to purchase BTC at a discount before prices surge due to expansionary policies from policymakers.Though the crypto market has seen a correction of over 60%, the long-term future of BTC remains positive due to growing institutional investments in the asset class. Furthermore, Bitcoin halving is expected to happen in March 2024, and its effects could be quite promising. Analysts are of the opinion that it could potentially trigger a surge towards $100,000.Ethereum (ETH)Concept graphic of Ethereum Classic (ETC) crypto logo in green techno styleSource: shutterstock.com/BT SideEthereum (ETH-USD) is arguably one of the most popular crypto platforms in terms of real-world utility. Its use cases are far wider than any of its peers, which have cemented its place in the decentralized finance and the non-fungible token markets.Ethereum looks primed for success down the line, especially considering its recent merge with another blockchain called the Beacon Chain. The merge effects haven’t yet been priced in due to the bearish sentiment. However, the merge has significantly improved Ethereum’s security and speed. What’s more, Ethereum plans to introduce sharding in the future, which will benefit users by reducing transaction fees and increasing speed even further.Ethereum is continuously progressing in its plans, with its highly anticipated Shanghai upgrade expected sometime next year. According to Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, Ethereum development is 55% complete after the merge, with plenty of upside ahead. Nonetheless, its users will already benefit from a faster and more secure platform.Viatris (VTRS)Viatris (VTRS) website page. Viatris.com logo on display screenSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.comViatris (NASDAQ:VTRS) has had an uphill battle since its reverse merger transaction in late 2020, and things appear to be turning around lately. Despite its high debt and low growth, investors have started paying attention to this pharmaceutical company as of late. This could be due to their expansive generic portfolio and capability of tapping into new market opportunities. With the right strategy in place, Viatris is set to grow at a healthy place for the foreseeable future.Investors have reason to be optimistic about VTRS stock as the imminent acquisitions of Oyster Point Pharma (NASDAQ:OYST) and Famy Life Sciences promise strong synergies in terms of revenue and cost optimization opportunities. These pending transactions are clearly a sign of better times ahead for shareholders, with the potential for considerable upside in the future. In addition, investors can take advantage of the firm’s incredible dividend yield of 4.5%.Albemarle Corporation (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comWith governments across the globe taking an active role in promoting electric vehicle adoption, it’s no wonder that demand for lithium has skyrocketed. This surge in demand has industry experts warning of an impending lithium shortage. Against this backdrop, lithium is emerging as a key clean energy investment, and Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) presents itself as a leading player in the space.The firm is leading the lithium sales boom, reporting an impressive 152% growth during the third quarter alone. This strong performance allows them to anticipate even more impressive returns this financial year, with a 447% adjusted EBITDA bump in 2022. The underlying driver for such success is the burgeoning demand for lithium and Albemarle’s ability to increase conversion capacity to 200ktpa by the end of this year. With the robustness in lithium prices, ALB should be able to keep up its positive momentum and enjoy the benefits of this increased valuation over the next 12 months.On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque held a long position in Ethereum.

67,ac543918-e1f4-3dfa-9765-d91db8f65fb7,ORCL,2022-12-25,Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) insider upped their holding by 27% earlier this year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-corporation-nyse-orcl-insider-120039555.html,1671969639,STORY,['ORCL'],"[Insiders were net buyers of Oracle Corporation's (NYSE:ORCL ) stock during the past year. That is, insiders bought more stock than they sold.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Oracle The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At OracleOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider purchase was by Independent Director Charles Moorman for US$1.3m worth of shares, at about US$84.57 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$80.85). It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. To us, it's very important to consider the price insiders pay for shares. It is encouraging to see an insider paid above the current price for shares, as it suggests they saw value, even at higher levels. Charles Moorman was the only individual insider to buy during the last year.You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeOracle is not the only stock insiders are buying. So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Oracle insiders own 43% of the company, currently worth about US$93b based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About Oracle Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Oracle shares in the last quarter. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. It would be great to see more insider buying, but overall it seems like Oracle insiders are reasonably well aligned (owning significant chunk of the company's shares) and optimistic for the future. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Oracle that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Story continuesOf course Oracle may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

68,c80aa016-4e5d-3f76-9c32-085b5d7b093c,MU,2022-12-25,Here's What We Like About Micron Technology's (NASDAQ:MU) Upcoming Dividend,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-micron-technologys-nasdaq-mu-121015884.html,1671970215,STORY,['MU'],"[It looks like Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is about to go ex-dividend in the next 4 days. The ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date, which is the cut-off date for shareholders to be present on the company's books to be eligible for a dividend payment. The ex-dividend date is important as the process of settlement involves two full business days. So if you miss that date, you would not show up on the company's books on the record date. Thus, you can purchase Micron Technology's shares before the 30th of December in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 19th of January.The company's upcoming dividend is US$0.12 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of US$0.46 per share to shareholders. Based on the last year's worth of payments, Micron Technology stock has a trailing yield of around 0.9% on the current share price of $50.2. Dividends are a major contributor to investment returns for long term holders, but only if the dividend continues to be paid. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing. Check out our latest analysis for Micron Technology Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Micron Technology has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 7.9% of its income after tax. A useful secondary check can be to evaluate whether Micron Technology generated enough free cash flow to afford its dividend. Over the last year it paid out 51% of its free cash flow as dividends, within the usual range for most companies.It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. With that in mind, we're encouraged by the steady growth at Micron Technology, with earnings per share up 3.9% on average over the last five years. Earnings per share growth has been slim, and the company is already paying out a majority of its earnings. While there is some room to both increase the payout ratio and reinvest in the business, generally the higher a payout ratio goes, the lower a company's prospects for future growth.Unfortunately Micron Technology has only been paying a dividend for a year or so, so there's not much of a history to draw insight from.To Sum It UpFrom a dividend perspective, should investors buy or avoid Micron Technology? Earnings per share have been growing at a steady rate, and Micron Technology paid out less than half its profits and more than half its free cash flow as dividends over the last year. All things considered, we are not particularly enthused about Micron Technology from a dividend perspective.Ever wonder what the future holds for Micron Technology? See what the 33 analysts we track are forecasting,  with this visualisation of its historical and future estimated earnings and cash flowIf you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Aon Aon Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the President, Eric Andersen, for US$2.1m worth of shares, at about US$283 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$301. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. This single sale was just 5.7% of Eric Andersen's stake.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 4.40k shares for US$1.3m. On the other hand they divested 9.65k shares, for US$2.7m. In total, Aon insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Aon insiders own 1.1% of the company, worth about US$712m. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Aon Insiders?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Aon shares in the last quarter. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Aon insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. To that end, you should learn about the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Aon (including 1 which is a bit unpleasant).Of course Aon may not be the best stock to buy.

76,9ea775eb-2fd2-3a63-8ae4-d88e11ed0010,WHR,2022-12-25,7 Stocks That Do Well When Rates Are Rising,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-well-rates-rising-183439732.html,1671647679,STORY,"['TFC-PR', 'TRV', 'ALL-PG', 'COST', 'LOW', 'WHR', 'D']","[When the latest Nov. jobs report came in hotter than expected, that was essentially the clue for investors to consider stocks to buy ahead of another year of possibly rising rates. Ordinarily, a robust labor market represents cause for celebration. However, in this case, it symbolized a repudiation of the Federal Reserve’s hawkish monetary policy.Stated differently, for all the central bank’s aggressive tightening, it failed to yield significant results. A strong labor market means more dollars chasing after fewer goods. Of course, the Fed wants the opposite circumstance: fewer dollars chasing after more goods. With other central banks adopting similar tightening policies to address inflation, stocks to buy for rising rates offer much relevance.TRVTravelers Companies$188.91ALLAllstate$135.11LOWLowe’s$201.41DDominion Energy$59.84COSTCostco$462.00WHRWhirlpool$141.19TFCTruist Financial$41.71InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStocks to Buy: Travelers Companies (TRV)Source: ShutterstockOne of the go-to stocks to buy for rising rates, Travelers Companies (NYSE:TRV) is an American insurance company. Per its public profile, Travelers is the second-largest writer of U.S. commercial property casualty insurance, and the sixth-largest writer of U.S. personal insurance through independent agents. What this all translates to is that the enterprise enjoys inelastic demand.Basically, no matter potential pricing fluctuations or shifting economic dynamics, Travelers will enjoy consistent and predictable demand. Further, the coronavirus pandemic imposed a sharp lesson on the American populace: anything and everything can happen as we realized the world’s a lot smaller than we thought it was. Therefore, people have an even greater incentive to protect themselves.To be fair, some economic forces may be so severe that they may dissuade even the purchase of critical insurance policies. However, such a draconian scenario may be unlikely. Sure enough, bullish investors recognize the realistic thesis undergirding TRV. On a year-to-date basis, shares gained over 19%, almost the exact inverse of the benchmark equities index.Story continuesStocks to Buy: Allstate (ALL)Allstate Insurance officeSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comShould the Fed continue to hit the accelerator on its hawkish monetary policy, your stocks to buy should concentrate on insurance plays such as Allstate (NYSE:ALL). As with Travelers Companies above, Wall Street recognizes the cynical opportunity in ALL stock. Since the start of the year, shares moved up 13%, a very respectable figure given the extraordinary circumstances.Moving forward, investors should keep close tabs on the insurance provider. Essentially, stocks to buy in the insurance field share a direct, linear relationship with benchmark interest rates. As rates move higher, so too does the valuation of insurance-based securities. While it’s not a guaranteed outcome, the relationship is generally dependable.Further, the smart money also recognizes the protective opportunity in ALL stock. While numbers fluctuate quarter to quarter, since the third quarter of 2021, hedge funds dramatically increased their exposure to Allstate. I don’t think that’s a coincidence given the aforementioned linear relationship with rising rates.Stocks to Buy: Lowe’s (LOW)A New Lowe’s Companies, Inc. CEO Could Be Just Enough of a TweakSource: ShutterstockColloquially, Murphy’s Law states that anything that can go wrong will go wrong. Given that this dynamic may rear its ugly head during a recession – which is exactly where the economy might head if rates continue to skyrocket higher – investors ought to focus their stocks to buy on acquiring shares of Lowe’s  (NYSE:LOW). A major home improvement retailer, Lowe’s offers impregnable relevance.Basically, no matter what happens in the economy, people need to repair and renovate their living spaces. Further, your plumbing doesn’t care whether you’re suffering from a recession or not. If the system decides it’s going to fail, it’s going to fail. Therefore, an enterprise like Lowe’s provides some reassurances for embattled consumers.To be fair, LOW stock made good on its ticker name this year, shedding more than 21% YTD. However, an unignorable development exists. Since Q3 2021, the smart money – the hedge funds – began building their position in Lowe’s Companies.Stocks to Buy: Dominion Energy (D)a truck bearing the Dominion Energy logoSource: ying / Shutterstock.comIf you want one of the best stocks to buy for rising interest rates, it’s difficult to ignore Dominion Energy (NYSE:D). To be fair, Dominion won’t immediately attractive conservative investors. Since the beginning of this year, D stock gave up 24% of equity value. In addition, the back half of the year has been rough. During the trailing half-year period, Dominion shed 20%.As if to pour salt on open wounds, TipRanks notes that the power and energy utility firm has a consensus hold rating. This breaks down to two buys, 11 holds and one sell. That’s not exactly an encouraging assessment. Worse yet, hedge funds remain unconvinced about Dominion. Presently, TipRanks states that sentiment among these institutional investors is negative.However, the naysayers seem to be missing the point. Should rates rise, discretionary spending will likely decline because of higher borrowing costs. On the other hand, the essentials – such as utility bills – must be paid no matter what. Thus, D stock enjoys a cynical upside catalyst.Costco (COST)Costco Stock May Be the Market’s Top Recession PickSource: ShutterstockAs I just mentioned, higher interest rates tend to pressure discretionary spending due to higher borrowing costs. In arguably most cases, this circumstance would impugn the upside mobility of retailers. However, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) represents a different breed. It’s not just because it offers consumer staples such as food and water (or other beverages). Rather, it enjoys a higher-income consumer demographic.According to data cited by Business Insider, your typical Costco shopper is younger and generates an income over $100,000. Presumably, such a high average income indicates higher educational attainment and/or owning valuable skills. In other words, the average Costco shopper will be able to absorb higher rates. And she will be able to absorb the side effects of higher rates, such as a recession.In this case, Wall Street analysts get why COST ranks as one of the stocks to buy. Presently, Costco features a moderate buy consensus view with 17 buys, seven holds and most importantly, no sells.Whirlpool (WHR)image of businessman holding a fiery arrow that's heading in an upward trajectorySource: ShutterstockPrior to writing this list of stocks to buy, I had a choice to make. Do I saturate this list with insurance and utility providers or do I get a bit adventurous? Since I’ve already given you the meat and potatoes of rising-rate insulant names, I’ll dedicate the next two slots with speculative market ideas. First up is appliance manufacturer Whirlpool (NYSE:WHR).At first glance, WHR does not appear to be a candidate for stocks to buy. Really, I can understand people think it’s one of the securities to sell. Since the start of the year, WHR dropped a staggering 41% of equity value. Moreover, Wall Street’s best and brightest do in fact peg Whirlpool as a consensus moderate sell.However, if you think three dimensionally, WHR might be a surprising idea for stocks to buy for higher rates. As you know, appliances represent necessities in the modern age. When they break down, it may be more cost-effective to replace them (instead of repairing them).Well, with millions of white-collar workers operating remotely, home appliances collectively received an unexpected workout. Eventually, that wear and tear will catch up, perhaps within 2023.Truist Financial (TFC)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar billsSource: shutterstock.com/CC7Generally speaking, I avoided mentioning banks and similar financial institutions for stocks to buy ahead of rising rates. On paper, higher interest rates bode well for banks. After all, they can charge more for their loan packages, improving profitability. However, fewer entities would be willing to borrow money precisely because said rates skyrocketed. Still, I’ll make an exception this case for Truist Financial (NYSE:TFC).Unlike a major multinational banking giant – I won’t mention specific names – Truist concentrates as a regional player. Per its public profile, the company operates 2,781 branches in 15 states and Washington, D.C. Truist is headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina. Coincidentally, the Tar Heel State features cities that attract plenty of interest from millennials. Stated differently, Truist operates in a region where the money will be spent, not where it was spent.Currently, TipRanks notes that TFC enjoys a moderate buy consensus rating. Among 13 analysts, six of them rate shares a buy while the remaining seven rate it a hold.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Of course, no investment category offers 100% guarantees – otherwise, everyone would take them. However, certain companies will likely hold up far better than others should circumstances go awry next year.Fundamentally, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve. Recently, the central bank raised the benchmark interest rate by 50-basis points, reflecting an ongoing commitment to tackle inflation. Indeed, with the November jobs report coming in hotter than expected, the news essentially confirmed that the Fed’s actions throughout 2022 yielded little results. Further, with global markets rumbling, investors are right to be concerned. Below are some recession-proof stocks to buy as market fears mount.SRESempra Energy$156.51CVXChevron$174.92KKellogg$71.91KMBKimberly Clark$136.85FIVEFive Below$172.98FLOFlowers Foods$28.99GOOG GOOGLAlphabet$90.39InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSempra Energy (SRE)The logo for Sempra (SRE) is seen at the top of an office building.Source: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.comQuite simply, utility plays like Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) rank among the best recession-proof stocks to buy for cynical reasons. Effectively, these enterprises enjoy a hostage audience or captive audience. True, people can choose to go off-grid but let’s face it. Very few people have the commitment to live that lifestyle.Before you send me an email to explain why you don’t fit that profile, let’s consider some broad research. About 95% of new year’s resolutions relate to fitness goals. After just three months, however, only 10% of folks believe their resolution will last. Given the extraordinary expenses associated with going off-grid, it’s safe to say that most households will never go this route.For those seeking recession-proof stocks to buy, this piece of human psychology offers great news. Not only is Sempra relevant but it also covers (i.e. monopolizes) many regions of Southern California. Representing the economic engine of the U.S., the Golden State features plenty of residents that will pay their bills.Story continuesChevron (CVX)Chevron (CVX) sing with ""diesel,"" ""food mart"" and ""car wash"" written underneathSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comRecently, the combination of skyrocketing inflation and geopolitical flashpoints bolstered the hydrocarbon energy industry. Naturally, big oil firms like Chevron (NYSE:CVX) benefited handsomely. However, with the wider push to integrate electric vehicles, the future of mobility going electric seems like a foregone conclusion.Nevertheless, Toyota (NYSE:TM) CEO Akio Toyoda recently stated that the “silent majority” of the auto industry questions the EV-only future. Sure enough, Fox News’ journalism and editorial arms picked up on the concept and the perhaps-borrowed lexicon. In a way, Toyota may have a point. Essentially, the current energy infrastructure might not be ready for full EV integration. And it might not be ready to accommodate 50% integration by 2030, a Biden Administration target. Therefore, those paying attention to the real details (instead of merely the social and political cues) may want to add CVX to their long-term portfolios of recession-proof stocks to buy.Kellogg (K)Kellogg's sign on their Canada's head office building in MississaugaSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAnyone looking for a traditional investment in recession-proof stocks to buy don’t need to think too hard with Kellogg (NYSE:K). Indeed, the brand practically sells itself during challenging times. Fundamentally, Kellogg caters to critical needs. As I’ve mentioned before, humans require a minimum amount of calories to sustain themselves. As a food manufacturer – specializing primarily in breakfast products – Kellogg brings exceptional relevancies to the table.Further out, K stock also caters to burgeoning trends. Just prior to the coronavirus pandemic, surveys revealed that younger consumers began embracing plant-based meat products. Not only do the products (generally) taste good and perhaps offers a healthier alternative (though debate rages), they feature sustainability. Unfortunately, the problem has always been economics.Compared to the real deal, fake meat products unfortunately carry higher prices due to smaller scales. However, with Kellogg having entered the space with its Incogmeato brand, it’s one of the few enterprises that offers credibility. Therefore, it’s worth keeping close tabs on K stock.Kimberly Clark (KMB)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAnother classic example of recession-proof stocks to buy, Kimberly Clark (NYSE:KMB) specializes in personal care products. As the Covid-19 outbreak confirmed, even under duress, people will buy the essentials with whatever money they have (or don’t). Indeed, desperate times call for desperate measures. It’s a harsh way of stating that KMB benefits from inelastic demand.Products that feature inelastic demand can incur price fluctuations and still enjoy consistent revenue influxes. Because Kimberly Clark’s core products feature revenue predictability – toilet paper, hygiene products, etc. – it’s easier for analysts to gauge performance. Further, during an economic downturn, investors desire some semblance of predictability. KMB provides that in spades.Also, the company offers fairly decent passive income. Currently, its forward yield stands at 3.43%, well  above the consumer staple sector’s average yield of 1.89%. In addition, Kimberly Clark commands 50 years of consecutive dividend increases. That’s a status that management won’t give up on so easily.Five Below (FIVE)storefront of a five belowSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comShould a downturn materialize, investors will likely gravitate toward discount retailers as one of the recession-proof stocks to buy. In this context, Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) offers much food for thought. Fundamentally, consumers typically don’t just cut all spending when faced with financial woes. Instead, a concept known as the trade-down effect occurs.Basically, people will seek out cheaper alternatives of their pre-recession purchase categories until they reach an effective balance between cost and quality. In other words, those that are shopping in a premium retailer now will probably not dig through dumpsters. Instead, they’ll pivot downward step by step until reaching an equilibrium point. For many, Five Below represents said point.Unlike a pure discount dollar store, Five Below mostly features products priced up to $5; hence the name. However, the stores also offer an assortment of products ranging from $6 to $25, enabling wider choices. It’s a discount but with a touch of class. This should appeal to consumers, making FIVE one of the recession-proof stocks to buy.Flowers Foods (FLO)A hand holds a bag of Dave's Killer Bread at the grocery storeSource: TonelsonProductions / Shutterstock.comArguably an easy idea for recession-proof stocks to buy, anyone concerned about an incoming downturn should target Flowers Foods (NYSE:FLO). No, it’s not the most exciting idea you could buy. And frankly, if we were living in any other market cycle, your money might be better spent somewhere else. As an example, FLO’s trailing five-year performance comes in at 45% up. Again, nothing riveting.However, this stat helps confirm that the underlying company managed to stay resilient during these troubles. In the trailing year, FLO gained 5.3% while on a year-to-date basis, it returned nearly 4%. In contrast, the benchmark S&amp;P 500 index is down a bit over 20% YTD. Under your typical assessment, the index treads water in bear market territory.Fundamentally, what makes Flowers Foods attractive is its core business: producing and marketing packed bakery food. Cynically, the products are cheap and filling, just what you would want during a recession.Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comAt first glance, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) does not seem like a candidate for recession-proof stocks to buy. Admittedly, the narrative doesn’t initially appear pleasant. Mostly, it’s the chart. Since the start of the year, the Class C GOOG shares dropped over 38% of equity value. For the curious, the Class A GOOGL shares fell almost to the same magnitude, just a bit worse.Why, then, would anyone want to consider Alphabet as one of the recession-proof stocks to buy? Simply, the answer centers on its Google ecosystem. Obviously, a main hallmark of a recession is job losses. As we’ve seen throughout this year, layoffs mounted heavily, particularly in the (high-paying) technology space.What will people do if they get the axe? In the modern age, they’ll turn to Google and search for new opportunities.Stated differently, Alphabet basically represents the gatekeeper of the internet. You want to search for anything, you’re going to do it through Google. And that’s what makes it an effective market idea during a possible downturn.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$24.8bUS$27.2bUS$28.7bUS$31.2bUS$33.0bUS$34.5bUS$35.8bUS$37.0bUS$38.1bUS$39.1bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 5.79%Est @ 4.65%Est @ 3.85%Est @ 3.29%Est @ 2.90%Est @ 2.62% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.5% US$23.2kUS$24.0kUS$23.8kUS$24.2kUS$24.1kUS$23.7kUS$23.1kUS$22.4kUS$21.6kUS$20.8k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$231bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$39b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.5%– 2.0%) = US$883bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$883b÷ ( 1 + 6.5%)10= US$470bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$701b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$531, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 29% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at UnitedHealth Group as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.811. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for UnitedHealth GroupStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is not viewed as a risk.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?""

80,b0600444-9ef4-3701-84e6-05add752dc52,ETN,2022-12-25,Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN) is a favorite amongst institutional investors who own 84%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eaton-corporation-plc-nyse-etn-130054886.html,1671886854,STORY,['ETN'],"[If you want to know who really controls Eaton Corporation plc (NYSE:ETN), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 84% to be precise, is institutions. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. As a result, a sizeable amount of institutional money invested in a firm is generally viewed as a positive attribute.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Eaton, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Eaton ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Eaton?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Eaton. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Eaton's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Eaton. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the largest shareholder, with 8.9% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.9% and 5.0% of the stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 21 shareholders have a combined ownership of 51% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of EatonThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Eaton Corporation plc in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$209m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 16% stake in Eaton. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Eaton .Ultimately the future is most important.

Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at PepsiCo's (NASDAQ:PEP) ROCE trend, we were pretty happy with what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for PepsiCo, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$13b ÷ (US$94b - US$26b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Thus, PepsiCo has an ROCE of 18%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Beverage industry average of 14% it's much better. See our latest analysis for PepsiCo roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for PepsiCo compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEWhile the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has employed 23% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 18%. Since 18% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.In Conclusion...To sum it up, PepsiCo has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 76% return if they held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.Story continuesPepsiCo does have some risks though, and we've spotted   3 warning signs for PepsiCo  that you might be interested in.While PepsiCo isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

The answer is: a wide variety of investors.Maybe you like to collect passive income, or perhaps you want to get defensive as a recession might be approaching in 2023. If you’re looking for lightning-fast price action, this probably isn’t for you, but many cautious-minded investors can think about buying PepsiCo shares.Many people are concerned about high inflation, interest rate hikes and the possibility of a recession coming. Amid this worrisome backdrop, it’s natural to seek shelter in cash. However, there are stocks that offer a good value and have fared comparatively well during recessions.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsIn other words, you don’t have to hide out in an all-cash position. PepsiCo’s longtime investors understand that great businesses and their shareholders can withstand tough economic conditions, and come out the other side intact.PEPPepsiCo$183.34PEP Stock Is Low-Volatility, and That’s ComfortingWhen you’re looking for a crisis hedge in the world of stocks, check for a low beta. That’s a measure of a stock’s volatility compared to the stock market in general.PEP stock has a five-year monthly beta of 0.59, so it moves slower than the S&amp;P 500, which has a beta of 1. That’s why this stock gets a “B” instead of an “A” rating; if you own too many PepsiCo shares, your portfolio will probably underperform the overall stock market.On the other hand, it should be fine to hold a few shares of PepsiCo. They’ve held up well during previous recessions, compared to more volatile, high-beta stocks. Plus, you can collect dividends while you wait for a recession to pass.Speaking of that, PepsiCo offers a forward annual dividend yield of 2.55%, which should appeal to passive income investors. Furthermore, PepsiCo has a trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.8x. So, the shares aren’t overpriced and that’s important during an economic downturn.Story continuesIt’s Not Bad that PepsiCo Is Trimming Its StaffSome folks might be worried about PepsiCo if they read that the company is laying off some of its workers. This doesn’t necessarily mean PepsiCo is in trouble, though.The Wall Street Journal broke the story that PepsiCo is reportedly “laying off workers at the headquarters of its North American snacks and beverages divisions.” Thus, this isn’t a massive headcount reduction throughout the entire company.It’s really just a sign that PepsiCo is serious about reducing its financial outlays. As a memo from PepsiCo explains, the layoffs are intended “to simplify the organization so we can operate more efficiently.”That’s not great news for the workers being laid off, of course. Still, it shows that PepsiCo is responsive to changing economic conditions. So, prospective investors should continue to monitor the headlines to see if PepsiCo implements further cost-cutting measures.What You Can Do NowNo financial asset is completely safe, but PEP stock has a history of weathering economic storms. Moreover, PepsiCo pays a dividend that should whet the appetite of passive income investors.Hence, a wide variety of people can benefit from a small stake in PepsiCo shares. Just don’t expect the same excitement – or the same risks – that you might get from higher-beta stocks.On the date of publication, Louis Navellier had a long position in PEP.

(NASDAQ:REGN) insiders sold US$7.0m worth of stock, possibly signalling a downtrend",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regeneron-pharmaceuticals-inc-nasdaq-regn-140044806.html,1671890444,STORY,['REGN'],"[The fact that multiple Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, when multiple insiders sell stock over a specific duration, shareholders should take notice as that could possibly be a red flag.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Independent Director, Arthur Ryan, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$4.3m worth of shares at a price of US$622 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$727. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. We note that the biggest single sale was only 26% of Arthur Ryan's holding.Insiders in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals didn't buy any shares in the last year.

A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals insiders own 4.2% of the company, worth about US$3.3b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much.
