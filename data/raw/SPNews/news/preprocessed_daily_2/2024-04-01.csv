If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you may go to 5 Cheapest Places to Retire Abroad on $1,000 per Month. ', 'Retiring in the United States of America is no longer the dream it once used to be. As of today, the US ranks amongst one of the most expensive countries to live in 2024, implying how financially challenging it can be for the average retiree to live in the country. This is particularly true for those on fixed incomes. Figures from the Social Security Administration highlight that as of January 2024, the average Social Security payment stood at just $1,909 per month. This amount falls significantly short of the $4,345 that the average retiree typically spends, as revealed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Although the 3.2% COLA adjustment may imply some measure of relief, regrettably, it has had minimal impact on alleviating the skyrocketing expenses associated with items like healthcare for retirees. Factor in the shattering retirement confidence that recent reports from BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) have revealed, and the retirement landscape in the US doesn’t seem as promising as it once used to be.', 'According to BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) reports, respondents believe that retirement is not the time to “live it up”. Rather, it is the time to feel “financially secure”. Having conducted this research jointly with the Employee Benefit Research Institute, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) reveals that across all wealth levels on average, most “current” retirees still had 80% of their pre-retirement savings even after almost two decades of being retired. One-third were found having grown their assets instead. Even though these statistics may seem like good news, the reality may paint a stark contrast. The truth is, many retirees may not be spending down their assets due to the uncertain retirement landscape that the country paints. Many may even believe on “hoarding” on these very assets in an attempt to enjoy the same lifestyle they did so before retirement.', 'Coming back to how the United States is increasingly becoming expensive to live in, a recent Consumer Expenditure Survey from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reveals that average monthly expenses for American households have risen to $6,081, amounting to $72,967 annually. This figure represents a notable increase from the $5,557 monthly expenditure recorded in 2022. In particular, expenses for seniors aged 65 and above amount to $57,818 annually. Out of this average annual expenditure, food and housing are the biggest expenses of retirees. Housing takes up an estimated 35% of average annual expenditures, while food accounts for an estimated average annual spending of $7,306. When considering additional expenses like transportation, healthcare, and maintenance, the list of financial obligations can seem never-ending. This is particularly daunting when juxtaposed with the average Social Security amount, which we have discussed early on.', 'These figures also highlight the ongoing struggle presented by high costs of living, which greatly affects the financial situation of residents nationwide, particularly those with fixed incomes.\xa0 Talking specifically about retirees, the median retirement savings for boomers stand at $202,000, as noted by TransAmerica Center for Retirement Studies. Moreover, a recent survey by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) reveals that Americans now believe they need an estimated $1.8 million to retire anyway. Comparing the median savings to this figure, it is safe to say that retirees with minimal savings are in for quite a difficult time in retirement. Their retirement savings may not be sufficient to cover expenses for retirees.', ""Further compounding the challenges of retirement planning is the healthcare landscape of the country. Factors like soaring healthcare costs and disparities in coverage are increasingly provoking retirees to question whether retirement in the USA is still a wise decision. The private healthcare insurance sector, as seen to be dominated by companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), and The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), are seen to report substantial profits, while customers bear the brunt of industry's prioritization of profits over patient well-being."", 'In 2023, internal documents from STAT showed that UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) used some secret rules that helped them restrict access to rehabilitation care that was requested from them by specific groups of patients that were seriously ill. This restriction included those who lived in nursing homes or suffered from cognitive impairment. In another instance, internal records from The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) that were scrutinized by ProPublica and The Capitol Forum revealed that the company had been accruing substantial savings by denying claims based on medical reasons. Allegedly, The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) doctors are neglecting to review patient files, as outlined in the report. Due to factors such as these, corporations like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) and The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) thrive, even as seniors suffer the consequences.', 'Retiring abroad, in contrast, is increasingly painting a compelling picture for retirees. Furthermore, data from sources like the Social Security Administration indicate a significant rise in the number of Americans receiving their benefits from overseas, reflecting the growing trend of retirees exploring international retirement options for reasons that extend beyond finances. For those whose average check is a mere $1,909 a month, or even lower considering this is only the average amount, it pays to know affordable retirement communities outside the country. There are many cheapest countries for retirement that will offer retirees such communities to explore, with many boasting a cost of living that is even lower than $1,000 on average. Living in these places doesn’t only prove cost-effective, but also a breeze considering that many of them are some of the easiest countries to retire to.', 'Stefano Ember/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile the list of cheapest places to retire abroad on $1,000 per month, we sifted through our lists of places to retire on $1,000 a month, cheapest warm places to retire around the world, best places to retire around the world for US Citizens, cheapest places to retire in Europe, best places to retire in the world on Social Security, and awesome places to retire on $3,000 or less, to name a few.

Basically, it may be time to consider following the money.', 'According to a Reuters report, investors dumped tech stocks at the fastest rate on record. Not only that, they poured money into investment-grade bonds and cash equivalents earlier this month. That’s coming from Bank of America, which cited data from EPFR, which provides fund flows and asset allocation information.', 'To be sure, the message here isn’t to spark a panic. However, because public tech enterprises have shot up so much, it may be time to do some trimming. If volatility strikes, it could strike fast and hard. With the funds acquired, you can instead consider the stocks hedge funds are buying.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Although it may represent an old industry, Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) is still a powerhouse. That’s mainly because of the underlying scientific realities. Few energy sources command the density of hydrocarbons. As it turns out, the big dogs understand this point well. It’s one of the stocks hedge funds are buying.', 'Per data from HedgeFollow, in the fourth quarter of last year, major institutions bought $9.42 billion worth of XOM stock. The biggest acquisition came from Fisher Asset Management, which bought $1.22 billion worth of shares. Next up is State Street (NYSE:STT) at $765.04 million, followed by BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) at $544.59 million.', 'Another factor to consider is the passive income. Right now, the company offers a forward dividend yield of 3.36%. Further, the payout ratio is very reasonable at 41.39%. Further, around 63% of XOM stock investors are institutional players, thus providing stability.', 'Analysts rate Exxon Mobil a moderate buy with a $125.31 price target.

Still, it does happen to be one of the stocks hedge funds are buying.', 'Per HedgeFollow, large investors acquired $7.5 billion worth of Visa shares during Q4. The biggest investor was State Street, with a bill that ran up to $461.37 million. Next up was BlackRock at $375.5 million. Coming in third place was Epoch Investment Partners, which clocked in at $267.35 million.', 'Now, Visa didn’t exactly light up the board last fiscal year. However, each of the past four quarters featured a beat against earnings per share. Overall, the average positive earnings surprise came out to 3.45%. Q1 2023 came up with the biggest surprise at 5%. For fiscal 2024, analysts believe Visa will post EPS of $9.92 against sales of $35.85 billion.', 'Last year, the company posted EPS of $8 on sales of $29.78 billion. Combined with a near-unanimous strong buy rating, Visa is looking good.', 'Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com', 'As a healthcare giant, UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is quite far away from the wild swings of technology-oriented securities. Per its public profile, UnitedHealth operates through four segments: UnitedHealthcare, Optum Health, Optum Insight, and Optum Rx.

It’s boring but it’s also one of the stocks hedge funds are buying.', 'Per HedgeFollow, large investors acquired $7.39 billion worth of UNH stock during Q4. The biggest investor was Jennison Associates LLC, ringing up $616 million. Next up was a usual suspect, State Street at $562.45 million.

While it’s not the most generous yield, the payout ratio sits at 30.55%. Also, UnitedHealth is one of the most relevant enterprises available.

Over the past 52 weeks, it’s up nearly 133%.', 'With stats like these, it’s no wonder that LLY ranks among the stocks hedge funds are buying. In Q4, Eli Lilly saw institutional investment inflows totaling $6.54 billion. The biggest investor was Vanguard Group, buying up $579.97 million worth of shares. Coming in second place was Citadel Advisors with $289.11 million.

BlackRock came in second at $1.03 billion, followed by Van Eck Associates at $731.09 million.', 'Notably, Newmont offers a forward yield of 2.92% although the payout ratio stands at a staggering 180.33%.

Costco marks up products, which it sells mostly in bulk, with razor-thin margins to cover costs, and it makes its profits on the fees.', 'Sales growth was sluggish for most of last year and even headed into negative territory, but that was mostly attributable to shoppers cutting down on large, expensive items.

Anthony Klotz, who coined the term 'Great Resignation,' notes that resignation rates have returned to pre-pandemic levels according to May 2023 data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), indicating a normalization of the job market."", 'Economists attribute the decline in resignations to various factors, including economic instability and improved working conditions. The current economic uncertainty has made workers more cautious about quitting, leading to a slowdown in resignation rates. Additionally, many individuals who made significant career changes during the pandemic have settled into new roles, contributing to the decline in quits. Job satisfaction is reportedly at its highest level in nearly four decades, reflecting improved workplace conditions and employer efforts to retain talent.', 'Despite the overall decline in resignations, certain industries continue to experience high turnover rates, such as healthcare, manufacturing, and construction.

The survey was conducted nationally and pointed to a nearly 6-point decline in worker confidence regarding organizational stability and leadership, coupled with a 2.7-point drop in satisfaction with cultural elements such as connection and recognition.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on finding the ideal retirement state, you may go to 5 Best States for Retirement in the US in 2024.', 'According to the International Monetary Fund, it is projected that global growth will stay at 3.1% in 2024 and rise to 3.2% in 2025. Compare it to the October 2023 World Economic Outlook (WEO), and the forecast for 2024 registers a 0.2 percentage point uptick. This upward trend can be attributed to the robust resilience demonstrated by the United States as well as other notable emerging market and developing economies. Moreover, the implementation of fiscal support measures in China have also contributed to this progress. Nevertheless, inflation has had wreck severe havoc to the global economy in the past few years. 2023, in turn, has been regarded as the year of “meaningful progress” in terms of efforts to mitigate its impact.', 'Despite efforts to mitigate inflation, consumers are continuing to face the brunt of rising prices, especially in terms of food. In the United States, customers have been resorting to cheaper options such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) in order to grasp economical groceries and other essentials. Recent news highlights that with food inflation finally coming down, and the US Department of Agriculture also forecasting the slow-down of inflation on at-home food products, companies such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) are now rolling some of its price increases back.', 'This is what Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) Chief Executive Doug McMillon has to say about prices going down:', '""I\'m excited about the omnichannel net promoter score trends the team is driving. Across countries, we continue to see a customer that\'s resilient but looking for value. As always, we\'re working hard to deliver that for them, including through our rollbacks on food pricing in Walmart U.S. Those were up significantly in Q4 versus last year, following a big increase in Q3,"" he said.', 'Moreover, McMillon said this about food in particular:', '""In food, prices are lower than a year ago in places like eggs, apples, and deli snacks, but higher in other places like asparagus and blackberries”.', ""The above remarks by Walmart imply that retirees on fixed incomes may finally be breathing a sigh of relief. This is in large because food is one of the biggest expenses of retirees, and eats away a sizable chunk of their average annual budget. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly 25% of retirees' monthly expenditures are allocated towards food. Notably, 44% of seniors revealed that food costs were their fastest-growing expenditure in 2021."", 'Housing expenses represent another significant financial burden for retirees, accounting for an estimated 35% of their incomes. In order to mitigate these costs, retirees often find themselves relocating to cheaper destinations that can help them stretch their retirement incomes further. U-Haul Holding Company (NYSE:UHAL) report highlights some of the top growth states where people are moving to, and states like Texas and Florida seem to be the winners. However, choosing any of these states only makes sense considering it has an overall low tax liability, a low cost of living, and even aspects such as proximity to family and friends.', 'For those on fixed incomes, many retirees find it rational to choose the best state to retire on a fixed income. After all, such a state would offer a low cost of living, and would be one of the best states to retire in money wise. However, as discussed, potential retirees must account for all factors that will impact their move before coming to a conclusion. With more and more individuals embarking on a journey towards their golden years as exemplified by the Peak 65 period, potential retirees often find themselves considering a wide array of factors to ensure their golden years are spent in an environment that perfectly aligns with their lifestyle, preferences, and financial considerations.', 'From climate and healthcare facilities to tax policies and cost of living, the decision to settle in a particular state can be multifaceted and deeply personal. But what makes a state “best” in terms of retirement? While there may be clear answers when to comes to best states to retire for taxes, best states to retire for healthcare, best states to retire for taxes and cost of living, the idea of crowing one best state for retirement in the US remains challenging. In order to take this challenge head on, we have crafted our own list of best states for retirement in the US in 2024.

Next, we ranked our shortlisted states on three factors; namely health, cost of living and tax-friendliness. For health, each score signifies a ranking out of all states, with 1 being the best.

For example, Duracell produces Kirkland batteries, and Starbucks supplies its House Blend coffee."", ""While it's not hard to find Kirkland Signature products, it can be difficult to know which are the best savings opportunities. To help you decide which Kirkland products to try next, here are 10 I've never regretted buying."", 'Online price: $22.99', ""Costco's Kirkland Premium Towels are thick, sturdy, and cheap. I use them for minor spills and accidents, like cleaning up our cats' hairballs, as well to pat-dry fish and chicken. They're not as strong as some brands, like Bounty, but they can get the job done at a good price. You'll pay about $1.20 for 100 sheets of Kirkland paper towels, which is cheaper than Kroger Paper Towels ($1.30 for 100 sheets) and Amazon's Presto! Brand ($1.77 per 100 sheets)."", 'Online price: $19.99', ""Nobody likes taking out the trash only to realize they don't have another garbage bag to replace it. Thankfully, Costco's Kirkland Kitchen Trash Bags are packaged with 200 bags, helping you cut down on the trips to the grocery store to buy this essential product. Plus, the price is a steal. At $19.99 for 200, you're paying about $0.10 a bag. If you were to buy the same kind of trash bag at Walmart (13 gallons), you would pay between $0.17 and $0.20 a pop, plus you'd get fewer bags per package."", 'Price varies by location', ""There's almost no competition with Kirkland Gasoline. If you're looking for the cheapest gas prices (at the highest quality), 9.9 times out of 10, you'll find it at Costco (Sam's Club drives a hard bargain, too). Not only that, but Costco also offers TOP TIER™ gasoline, which, according to AAA research, is said to be cleaner and more efficient than brands that do not fall into that elite category."", 'Online price: $16.99', 'This has long been one of my favorite Kirkland products. You can buy a 1.5-pound bag of these emerald delicacies for $16.99, or roughly $11.33 per pound. For comparison, Walmart sells pistachios at about $13.31 per pound, Kroger sells them at $12 a pound, and Amazon also sells them at $12 per pound.', 'Online price: $16.99', ""The Kirkland Signature Adult Multivitamin has 160 gummies per bottle and are sold in packs of two. The price is decent -- $0.05 per gummy -- which is the same as Amazon but slightly more expensive than Walmart ($0.046). That said, pay close attention to the dosage of vitamins in each vitamin package, as Costco's brand typically has higher values. For example, the Kirkland Signature gummies have 750 mcg of Vitamin A, 30 mg of Vitamin C, and 20 mcg of Vitamin D, while Walmart's brand has 390 mcg, 60 mg, and 10 mcg of the same vitamins."", 'Online price: $7.99', ""Don't even get me started on the Kirkland Creamy Almond Butter. I use this for toast, smoothies, toppings for carrots and celery, and just as a snack off the spoon. The quality is excellent. It's creamy but doesn't leave you with that fatigued feeling that some heavily sugared peanut butters induce. Combine this with some Kirkland Strawberry spread, and you'll have yourself a good AB&J."", 'Online price: $10.99', 'No ""best-of"" list would be complete without mention of Kirkland Signature bacon.

Not only do they taste good, but the price is deliciously low: $10.99 for a 20-ounce bag. Use them for salads, baked potatoes, casseroles, or just as a snack.', 'Online price: $17.99', 'Another Kirkland classic, Costco sells organic raw honey in packs of three 24-ounce jars shaped like cute, harmless bears. As a regular consumer of this honey, I can testify that it\'s Grade-A and can excite the taste buds like some fancier, ""straight-from-the-hive"" products. Plus, at $17.99, you\'re paying about $0.25 an ounce, which is cheaper than Amazon ($0.56 an ounce) and Walmart ($0.40 an ounce).', 'Online price: $21.99', ""This is by far one of my most-purchased Kirkland Signature products. I'm pretty snobby when it comes to what oils we use when we're cooking, but none of Costco's olive oils -- including its Spanish and Organic Olive Oil -- have disappointed me. Truthfully, the price difference between this and Walmart's Great Value olive oil isn't substantial ($0.325 per fluid ounce at Costco versus $0.326 at Walmart), but I like the taste of Costco's olive oil more (like I said, I'm a snob)."", 'Price: $32.99', ""For about $33, you can buy a box of 51 single-serving snacks, like granola bars, trail mix, almonds, cashews, peanuts, and nut bars. This can be perfect for kids' lunches or your own snacks during the day. Although this would probably be lethal if you're allergic to nuts, it's definitely worth the price if you count them as one of your favorite snacks."", ""All things considered, you're going to find a lot of great Kirkland Signature products at Costco, many of which can help you plan for your personal finances. Next time you're at Costco, check out these 10 products and see if they don't make it on your list of personal favorites."", 'This credit card is not just good – it’s so exceptional that our experts use it personally.

In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' See our latest analysis for Microchip Technology ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Microchip Technology is:', '33% = US$2.4b ÷ US$7.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.33 in profit."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""First thing first, we like that Microchip Technology has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 14% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. As a result, Microchip Technology's exceptional 43% net income growth seen over the past five years, doesn't come as a surprise."", ""We then compared Microchip Technology's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 29% in the same 5-year period."", 'Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Has the market priced in the future outlook for MCHP? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. ', ""Microchip Technology's three-year median payout ratio is a pretty moderate 37%, meaning the company retains 63% of its income. So it seems that Microchip Technology is reinvesting efficiently in a way that it sees impressive growth in its earnings (discussed above) and pays a dividend that's well covered."", ""Moreover, Microchip Technology is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company is expected to keep paying out approximately 38% of its profits over the next three years. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Microchip Technology's future ROE will be 39% which is again, similar to the current ROE."", ""On the whole, we feel that Microchip Technology's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

Microsoft has aligned itself with ChatGPT parent OpenAI, while Alphabet has sought to challenge its leadership with products like Bard and later Gemini. So which artificial intelligence (AI) stock is the better buy?', 'Jeremy Bowman (Microsoft): The question of whether to build or buy is a common one in technology, and in generative AI, Microsoft and Alphabet have largely gone in different directions in this regard.', ""Microsoft has tied its fortunes to OpenAI, the ChatGPT parent, through a reported $13 billion investment, and that has enabled Microsoft to essentially use OpenAI's technology as its own. As a result, the tech giant has been able to implement OpenAI's technology in products like its Azure cloud infrastructure services, GitHub code repository, Office productivity suite, and Bing search engine."", ""Those moves are already having an impact as Microsoft said that AI added 6 percentage points to Azure's growth in the most recent quarter."", ""Microsoft's diversification also acts as a competitive advantage here. Unlike Alphabet, which makes a majority of its revenue from search advertising, Microsoft has a wide array of products that span enterprise software, video games, cloud computing, social media, and more, and that gives it more opportunities to leverage the power of AI."", 'Microsoft has also been more aggressive in AI than Alphabet has. CEO Satya Nadella has apparently been planning for this moment for years, as Microsoft first invested in back in 2019.', ""Alphabet has also been investing in AI for several years, but the company has been more hesitant to release new products, and when it has it hasn't always gone well. The initial presentation for Bard was sloppy and widely panned, and Gemini has been criticized for historical inaccuracies."", 'Microsoft shows no intention of slowing down in AI; it just hired Deepmind co-founder Mustafa Suleyman, who also co-founded the recently shuttered Inflection AI. Microsoft stock may be expensive, but it deserves to trade at a premium. It will be hard to catch the AI leader.', ""Anders Bylund (Alphabet): I have nothing but respect for Microsoft, but Redmond's finest can't measure up to Alphabet's ultimate long-term planning."", ""Alphabet's visionary approach and unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of innovation make it a compelling choice for investors seeking long-term growth. The company's core business -- online search and advertising under the Google banner -- dominates the search engine market. However, Alphabet's ambitions extend far beyond search, with the company consistently investing in cutting-edge technologies that have the potential to reshape entire industries."", ""One such area is artificial intelligence, where Alphabet's research and development efforts have produced groundbreaking advancements. From natural language processing to computer vision, Alphabet's AI technologies are being applied in diverse fields, from healthcare research to self-driving vehicles."", ""Moreover, Alphabet's commitment to moonshot projects through its X division showcases its willingness to take calculated risks in pursuit of revolutionary innovations. Projects like Intrinsic, Alphabet's industrial robotics project, and Loon, which aims to provide internet access to remote areas via high-altitude balloons, exemplify the company's audacious vision and long-term thinking."", ""Long story short, Alphabet is ready to roll with the punches as the tech market evolves. Furthermore, the stock is much more affordable than Microsoft, whose stock has soared on the wings of its deep OpenAI partnership. You can pick up Alphabet shares at the reasonable price of 6 times sales or 27 times free cash flow today.

The industry has now attracted more than $6 billion in funding to date, according to data from the Fusion Industry Association (FIA), with companies such as Google (GOOG) and Chevron (CVX) as part of a growing list of backers.', ""“Previously, it was always the government making investments to the Department of Energy or other governments around the world,” FIA CEO Andrew Holland told Yahoo Finance. “Well, now it's private industry, private businesses, startups, who are saying, 'What do we need to design from the beginning?

But that energy gain lasted for less than one-billionth of a second. Researchers are now looking to extend that plasma reaction so it can be sustained for commercial use.', 'Now, more than 40 startups are racing ahead with the goal of becoming the first to commercialize fusion. Washington-based Helion Energy has set one of the most aggressive targets, signing a commercial agreement with Microsoft (MSFT) to provide power generated by fusion in four years. Meanwhile, MIT-backed Commonwealth Fusion Systems, which has raised funding from Gates’s Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Jeff Bezos, and Richard Branson, aims to have a commercial plant up and running by the 2030s.', 'Bloomberg Intelligence estimated that the valuation for fusion energy is likely to grow to $40 trillion if it captures just 1% of the global gigawatt energy output.', '“What we do know is that we have a very targeted set of goal-driven experiments and research efforts going on around the world that are trying to solve remaining challenges,” said David Pace, deputy director at the DIII-D National Fusion Facility, which is home to the country’s largest magnetic fusion facility and is funded by the Department of Energy. “The challenges are very laser-focused on issues that prevent us from building the kinds of facilities that produce net energy and then facilities that convert that net energy into electricity.”', 'Governments are also increasing funding to help accelerate commercialization. The US government set aside a record $1.48 billion for fusion research in its 2024 budget alone. And in France, home to the world’s largest fusion reactor — known as ITER — 35 countries have joined forces to build a facility estimated at roughly $20 billion.', 'But the path forward is far from clear, including the process by which fusion energy is likely to be commercialized. Facilities like ITER and DIII-D, for example, are utilizing doughnut-shaped machines known as tokamaks, which rely on powerful magnets to confine and insulate the plasma so temperatures are hot enough for the fusion reaction to occur. The breakthrough at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory was achieved through a process using lasers.', 'Experts say the key to commercialization, in addition to maintaining net energy gain, is to build smaller, less expensive reactors at a rapid rate. In the most recent FIA report, 25 companies expressed optimism that the first fusion plant will deliver electricity to the grid before 2035.', 'The push to commercialize nuclear fusion has come with renewed urgency for a reliable source of clean energy in the face of climate change as governments look to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.', 'At the most recent UN Climate Change Conference, former White House climate envoy John Kerry laid out a framework for international cooperation to accelerate the advancement of fusion energy while acknowledging its “scientific and engineering challenges.”', ""“There's not many other options. We have to invest in something,” Callaway said. “We have to throw the Hail Mary, so to speak, of technology to try to solve this problem, which is driving oil interest and gas interests and countries against each other in response to climate change.

Here's why investors might want to own a stake in each of them to ride the AI boom."", ""The gaming industry used to be Nvidia's largest source of revenue, but its graphics processing units (GPUs) for the data center are now driving its business forward. In fiscal 2024 (ended Jan. 28), Nvidia's H100 GPU sent the company's data center revenue surging 217% to $47.5 billion, and the current fiscal 2025 year is expected to bring more growth."", ""Nvidia's H100 is the most sought-after data center chip for AI workloads. Many tech giants are lining up to buy it in large volumes, from Amazon to Oracle to Meta Platforms. But Nvidia will ramp up shipments of its new H200 GPU this year, which could fuel the company's next wave of growth."", ""The H200 can inference -- which means to feed live data to an AI model so it can make predictions -- at twice the speed of its predecessor, and it also consumes 50% less energy, so it's a big cost saver for data center operators."", ""Longer term, all eyes are on Nvidia's new Blackwell architecture, which will power its next-generation chips.

They can be found in the Microsoft Xbox Series X and the Sony PlayStation 5, not to mention a long list of personal computers. But AMD recently launched its MI300 series of data center chips in a quest to chase down Nvidia."", ""The MI300 is available as a standard GPU called the MI300X, but it's also available in a combined GPU and CPU configuration called the MI300A. AMD is already shipping the MI300A to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for its El Capitan supercomputer, which will be one of the most powerful in the world when it comes online this year. But a number of leading data center operators, including Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms, are also lining up to buy the MI300 series."", ""While AMD is chasing Nvidia in the data center, the company has a dominant market share of 90% in the emerging AI-enabled personal computing industry. Millions of computers from manufacturers like Dell and HP have already shipped with AMD's Ryzen AI chips, which allow users to process AI on-device. That leads to a faster, more responsive experience, because AI workloads don't have to travel to and from the data center."", ""In the recent fourth quarter of 2023, the Ryzen AI series sent the company's Client segment revenue up 62% year over year. Combined with the growing shipments of the MI300 chips -- which could generate $3.5 billion in sales in 2024 -- this could be AMD's biggest year."", ""Micron doesn't get as much attention as Nvidia and AMD because it produces memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, which aren't as glamorous as GPUs. However, every GPU requires memory, and it's critical to extracting its maximum performance."", ""Micron's latest HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) data center solution was selected by Nvidia to power its new H200. It's an obvious choice because it consumes 30% less power than competing HBM hardware, making it far more cost efficient. Micron is currently sampling a new HBM3E product, which packs 50% more memory into each GPU, allowing Nvidia's customers to bring their AI models to market far more quickly."", ""Micron's entire 2024 HBM inventory is already sold out, and much of its 2025 stock is already spoken for, too."", ""Like AMD, Micron's AI opportunity is expanding beyond the data center. The AI-enabled chipsets inside new personal computers can require 80% more DRAM content than traditional models, which is great for Micron's business. Many modern smartphones are also fitted with AI chips, which need twice as much DRAM as traditional devices. Samsung's new Galaxy S24 comes with a slew of AI features, and it runs on Micron's hardware."", ""Micron's revenue jumped 57% year over year during the fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Feb. 29). The company also delivered net income of $793 million, marking a welcome return to profitability after more than a year grappling with falling prices due to an oversupply of chips."", ""Micron's forecast for the upcoming fiscal 2024 third quarter (ending June 1) points to accelerated revenue growth of 76%.

And nuclear fusion."", 'Nuclear fission takes a very large atom, splits it apart.', ""DAVID PACE: And the way fusion works is we're going to take two atoms. And we're going to smash them together."", ""EVAN LEPPINK: And when they fuse, they convert some of their mass into energy. So Einstein's famous E equals Mc squared equation. Nuclear fusion, generally, only happens in stars, where it's contained by the gravity of its own mass."", 'Here on Earth, what we do is we use strong magnetic fields to create a container called a tokamak.', 'PAUL SCHROEDER: The temperature inside the machine is about 10 times the core of the sun.', 'DAVID PACE: If you were to make this super hot fusion plasma and it would touch the wall, then the wall would be immediately vaporized.', ""The idea behind the tokamak is that you're going to make a bottle out of magnetic field. So that way, the super hot fusion plasma never touches the walls."", ""EVAN LEPPINK: We know how to do fusion. But we just can't do it efficiently enough to get more power out than what we put in."", ""- And that's the key to making fusion commercially viable.

This is one of the most impressive scientific feats of the 21st century.', '- Researchers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory achieved that energy gain two years ago. But that reaction lasted less than 1 billionth of a second. And it was done using lasers unlike a tokamak, which uses magnets.', 'EVAN LEPPINK: When NIF, the National Ignition Facility achieved ignition, they used very powerful lasers to create a reaction in a very small capsule. And that, perhaps, has difficulties scaling up. Whereas, what we do here, which is use very large scale powerful magnets seems to have a clearer path towards nuclear power plant that could power your home.', '- Those here at DIII-D are trying to unlock that same breakthrough using magnets, with funding from the Department of Energy. That development could pave the path to commercialization.', 'DAVID PACE: And this is where this very healthy university, US National Laboratory, and private industry partnership comes into play.', ""PAUL SCHROEDER: Right now, DIII-D is an event. What that means is the machine is not operating on a daily basis. But what that means also is that we're upgrading a lot of systems."", ""EVAN LEPPINK: During this upgrade period, we're installing new systems. So that in the future, we can test new regimes of science."", ""So for the first time, we're testing a new technology that could improve the heating of the fusion reaction."", '- All right. You ready?', ""EVAN LEPPINK: I got the head. And I've got the tail. For the first time, we put these modules into the machine."", ""- That's one. Seven down."", 'EVAN LEPPINK: Eight to go. This system will improve the stability of the plasma. The plasma fills this volume. And for fusion to happen, you need a hot, dense plasma. And this system helps increase temperature. It adds energy to the plasma. And it improves stability so that we can have more fusion reactions occur.', 'This is a system that could play a role in designing a future nuclear fusion power plant.', '- The process of getting there is an expensive one. Billions of dollars just to build the reactors.', ""- So what we're going to do is we'll take this out here. And then we'll slide this rod in here."", ""- But big name investors are lining up to fund the research, because a potential breakthrough could transform industries. Just think, limitless energy, no fossil fuels, no carbon emissions, which is why you've got Google and Chevron, Bill Gates and Sam Altman, Jeff Bezos all placing their bets."", ""DIII-D isn't looking to commercialize this technology. It's laying the groundwork for it."", ""PAUL SCHROEDER: So when DIII-D is ready to go online, the tokamak is going to get closed up. We're going to turn the machine on."", '- Starting set up for shot 555.', ""PAUL SCHROEDER: There's a couple of countdown timers."", '- Three seconds, two, one, shot in progress.', 'PAUL SCHROEDER: And then at time zero, everything starts. And you can hear out in the power yard. You can hear a lot of the big electronics equipment, making these sounds, these pulsing sounds.', 'Magnetic fields are turned on. We inject gas. And that gas then turns into a plasma.', 'DAVID PACE: We put in about 20,000 to 40,000 homes worth of power, just to make this fusion plasma hot. And then on top of that, we shoot in electromagnetic waves. And each one of our seven sources puts in about the equivalent of 1,000 home kitchen microwaves.', ""EVAN LEPPINK: We call our plasma discharges that we have shots. They last five to eight seconds. And then it's over."", ""PAUL SCHROEDER: We're going to collect all this data. And all the science teams are going to work together to figure out what it means."", ""- Those seconds may seem short. But it's an eternity for fusion technology. The challenge is to control those reactions long enough so they can sustain the plasma for much longer months at a time for a commercial power plant."", ""PAUL SCHROEDER: The perennial question for what we do here is when you will have power on the grid.

But so far, progress has been slow."", '- You know what I mean?', 'PAUL SCHROEDER: Yeah. So we have this guy is a reticle. That guy is a reticle. This way. And then you just adjust whatever you have to on this guy.', '- As research labs like DIII-D aim to achieve new milestones for energy output, larger tokamaks under construction are looking to extend the length of fusion reactions.', 'At Commonwealth Fusion Systems, an MIT spinoff backed by Google and Bill Gates, researchers hope to fire the first shot in their reactor later next year. ITER in France is expected to come online later this decade.', 'EVAN LEPPINK: With climate change looming, I think the desire for a technology, like nuclear fusion is only going to grow.', ""DAVID CALLAWAY: There's a lot more willingness to talk about unproven types of renewable energy like fusion, because we're running out of options. And so you're seeing fusion research appear more and more at these global summits like COP28."", 'JOHN KERRY: Fusion may turn out to be just an enormous game changer.', ""DAVID CALLAWAY: You're seeing politicians like, John Kerry, talk about it.

But could they also bring a great opportunity to invest in high-profile mega-cap growth stocks?

However, analysts remain bullish about several of them -- and one in particular. Here\'s the best Magnificent Seven stock to buy in April, according to Wall Street.', 'We can quickly cross several names off the list. Analysts believe some high-flying members of the Magnificent Seven will run out of steam.', ""For example, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) shares have soared around 140% over the last 12 months. Wall Street expects the stock's momentum will hit a brick wall. The consensus 12-month price target for Meta is a little lower than its current share price."", ""Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been an even bigger winner, with its share price skyrocketing 240% during the same period. Again, though, analysts aren't optimistic the chipmaker has much more room to run. The average price target for Nvidia reflects minimal upside potential."", ""It's a similar story for Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Although the tech giant has delivered an impressive gain of more than 50% over the last 12 months, the path forward could be more difficult. The consensus price target for Microsoft is less than 1% above the current share price."", ""Wall Street isn't much more bullish about Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). Even though it's the worst performer in the Magnificent Seven over the last 12 months with shares falling instead of rising, the average price target for the electric vehicle maker reflects an upside potential of less than 2%."", 'That leaves the ""A team"" as the top contenders: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). All three stocks are running neck-and-neck as Wall Street\'s favorite right now.', 'Amazon has been by far the biggest winner of these three over the last 12 months with its shares vaulting more than 80% higher.

The company reported year-over-year revenue growth of only 2% in the quarter ending Dec. 30, 2023."", ""I'd take analysts' price targets with a grain of salt -- or better yet, a shaker of salt. However, I think Wall Street could be right about Apple's share price rising over the coming months."", ""The conventional wisdom is Apple has been left behind in the AI race. That's partly because the company tends to keep its plans closer to the vest than most big tech companies. When investors don't know what's coming, they can sometimes think the worst."", 'But Apple will likely reveal its long-awaited AI strategy at its developer conference in June. CEO Tim Cook told shareholders at the annual meeting earlier this year the company is ""investing significantly"" in generative AI because of its ""incredible breakthrough potential."" He added that he would share more details later in 2024.', 'It\'s possible that Apple won\'t reveal as much as investors hope or that its AI strategy doesn\'t meet expectations.

The National Retail Federation recently said in a report that it estimates retail sales to increase in the range of 2.5% and 3.5% in 2024, compared to retail sales growth of 3.6% recorded last year.', 'Jack Kleinhenz, the chief economist at the NRF, said that consumers have shown “much great resilience than expected” and “it’s hard” to be bearish on the consumer. Most of this strength comes from household savings accumulated during the pandemic days.', 'But Kleinhenz wondered whether this consumer resilience will continue in the future since inflation begins to bite and savings diminish.', 'When the pandemic hit, US consumers began spending money on goods instead of experiences and services amid lockdowns. But immediately after the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions, Americans began spending a fortune on experiences. However, Bank of America in its “Consumer Checkpoint” report published in January said that its Winter Spending Survey showed that consumers were planning to decrease spending on dining out, takeout, social events and experiences', 'Bank of America said it surveyed about 2,000 consumers in the US and found that a whopping 59% of the consumers were planning to start 2024 with caution, with intentions to save money and cut back on spending.', 'So far this year, retail and consumer stocks remain strong. VanEck Retail ETF (NASDAQ:RTH) is up about 12.2% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to a 10.2% gain for the S&P 500. Investors would be watching Q1’2024 earnings of retailers closely to see how the US consumer is reacting to the changes in inflation and wage growth. Some analysts are also hopeful that rate cuts would bode well for retail stocks.', 'Back in December, a Wall Street Journal report cited Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, who said at the time that consumer has been “resilient throughout it all.” Woods said that the overall sentiment was that it’s “OK, we aren’t going to be in a recession. Things are getting little bit better.”', 'Canaccord’s Tony Dwyer recently talked with CNBC and said that the Federal Reserve would need to get “aggressive” when it comes to rate cuts and should not keep interest rates higher for longer to avoid massive layoffs and recession.

Customers include professional flooring installers (40% of sales) and homeowners (60%) primarily doing residential repair and remodel projects. FND directly sources its products from over 240 vendors in over 24 countries, enabling it to eliminate middlemen such as agent/ brokers, importers, and distributors. We believe this direct sourcing model gives the company a cost advantage over its competitors and allows it to offer customers the lowest prices in the industry. FND is also able to offer the largest selection of in-stock flooring in the industry because its stores are significantly larger than its competitors. This differentiated value proposition has enabled FND to consistently take market share from both home improvement centers (~30% of the market) and independent specialty retailers (~60% of the market).', 'The management team, led by Tom Taylor, CEO, has a strong track record of successfully opening more than 170 new stores over the last decade, with plans to eventually reach 500. Stores typically generate 50% cash on cash returns by year 3, meaning each new store should create significant value for shareholders.

Shares are down more than 75% from the all-time high, reached way back in early 2015.

From 2014 through late 2023, the payout was increased 40%."", ""Well, even that's gone, with the near-halving of the dividend late last year now resulting in a payout that's 26% lower than it was in 2015."", ""The good news is a new CEO is taking steps to slash costs and stimulate profitable growth.\xa0Is Walgreens stock a buy now? Keep reading for the one reason why it could be compelling, a major yellow flag that says maybe it's not, plus a stock that you may want to consider instead."", ""Tim Wentworth was named CEO last Oct. 11, and he didn't waste any time in enacting cost-cutting efforts at the company. When it reported first quarter results 12 weeks later, one of the first lines in the press release announced the 48% dividend cut."", ""This move made a bold statement that there would be no sacred cows in this turnaround. Prior to the cut, Walgreens had increased its dividend every year for a remarkable 47 years. Wentworth -- with the backing of the Board of Directors, which has the final say on things like dividends -- has quickly taken action to get Walgreens' financial house in order so that it can enact the meaningful changes that it will take to reinvigorate the business and return it to profitable growth."", 'In addition to the dividend cut, the company has also taken some real steps to lower costs and expenses.

His experience in the healthcare industry is a real plus. But the reality is, Walgreens' fast moves are as much a product of need as much a desire to improve the business."", 'Despite the improvements on the top line -- revenue was up 8% in the first half of the fiscal year -- non-pharmacy retail sales declined 5.3%. Management says that seasonality played some role in this, but they also lowered profit expectations for the full year, citing the competitive environment. I think those two things are more related than just seasonality.', ""At the same time, one of the company's biggest initiatives, healthcare, took another step backwards. Walgreens took a $5.8 billion impairment to its investment in VillageMD, reflecting much lower expectations for its full value over time. The upshot is that VillageMD revenues increased 20% last quarter, but the healthcare business continues to generate an operating loss."", ""This adds to Walgreens' cash flow woes.

That's a lot of money that has to come off the balance sheet to cover those checks."", 'Even with promised expense and cost cuts, Walgreens has a lot of work to do. In the first six months of the fiscal year, its working capital has remained unchanged, but it has burned through some $11 billion in total assets on its balance sheet.', ""About half of that is the VillageMD impairment, but what is easy to miss is that it has realized $1.7 billion in proceeds from the sale of its equity stake in Cencora so far this year, but Cencora's market value has increased enough to offset the impact of these sales on the balance sheet."", 'And as measured by cash in and cash out, as generated by its operations, Walgreens is a long way from turnaround complete. That\'s particularly notable for income investors who may think the ""new"" dividend is safe. Barring a reversal in those cash flows, another cut is surely on the table.', ""Whether you're looking for steady income, a high yield, or a likely market-beater over the long term, Realty Income (NYSE: O) may be a better choice. As a starting point, its dividend is very secure, protected by strong cash flows from its tenants that rely on the properties they lease from Realty Income to generate their sales and profits."", 'Realty Income is one of the largest net lease REITs -- it owns the real estate, while its tenants pay it rent, cover property taxes, and pay for improvements and maintenance -- in the world. Its tenants include Walgreens and competitor CVS Health, along with hundreds of other tenants in retailing, restaurants, experiential, and other e-commerce and macroeconomic resilient businesses.', ""One of the best capital allocators in real estate, Realty Income's business is built on creating value for its tenants and its investors, and growing the payout is a key tenet of its business model. It has increased its dividend not just every year since its 1994 IPO, but every quarter. It's also a monthly payer, a nice bonus for income investors."", ""Put it all together, and you have a stronger business, a safer dividend, and a payout that's still growing.

More recently, the FDA approved the company's new aortic valve replacement system."", ""The past several years have been difficult ones for Walgreens Boots Alliance shareholders. In a nutshell, the company's attempt to become more than a chain of retail pharmacies isn't working out. As a result, it reduced its dividend by 48% this year. At recent prices, the stock offers a 4.6% yield."", ""Investors who follow Walgreens closely will remember it had planned to launch 1,000 primary care practices in partnership with VillageMD, a joint venture partly owned by Cigna. Walgreens plowed billions into VillageMD but has nothing but losses to show for it. During Walgreens' fiscal second quarter that ended Feb. 29, the partners wrote down the value of VillageMD by $12.4 billion."", ""Walgreens' portion of the latest VillageMD impairment charge worked out to $5.8 billion and led to a reported net loss of $5.9 billion in its fiscal second quarter. Even after adjusting for non-cash impairment charges, the company reported second-quarter operating income that sank 26.5% year over year to just $900 million."", ""Retail pharmacies are increasingly at the whim of pharmacy benefits managers, or PBMs, that essentially determine how much they receive for dispensing prescription drugs. Without a PBM of its own, it's hard to see how Walgreens will grow its bottom line in the years ahead."", 'Walgreens offers a higher yield, but shrinking profit margin in the retail pharmacy space could make growing its bottom line, and dividend payout, next to impossible over the long run.', ""Medtronic's not growing as quickly as it used to, but developing new medical technology is a more lucrative endeavor than the troubled retail pharmacy business.

It is about work redesign, it is about taking the lower-value work off the table,"" he told Yahoo Finance on Thursday.', ""The longtime healthcare executive is signaling a seismic shift in how the company operates, with an eye toward fewer verticals within the business. Wentworth, former CEO of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts, which was acquired by Cigna (CI) in 2018, previously announced 60 VillageMD closures. The co-located clinics and pharmacies were the result of a $5 billion Walgreens partnership in 2020 prior to Wentworth's arrival last year, and were part of a broader strategy to be more health services focused — similar to rival CVS's (CVS) Minute Clinic."", ""The clinics caused a nearly $6 billion drop in the company's second quarter revenue compared to the prior year, the company announced on Thursday. Still, Walgreens managed to beat earnings expectations, reporting earnings per share of $1.20 compared to analyst expectations of $0.82. The company's stock was up nearly 4% in trading Thursday."", ""In its post-results earnings call, Wentworth noted that the National Health Service, the UK's health agency, recently began allowing pharmacists to diagnose and prescribe medication for seven common health conditions, including shingles, UTIs, and sore throats. Boots locations in the UK are part of this new program, which gives Wentworth access to firsthand data on how it works and how it could be replicated in the US."", '""We are on a mission to achieve provider status for our pharmacists, given their influence, which was so clearly highlighted during the pandemic. This would allow them to get reimbursed for providing select services to patients,"" Wentworth said on the call regarding the US labor force.', '""These are highly trained clinical professionals ... whose scope of practice goes well beyond dispensing medications,"" he added.\xa0', 'How the company can achieve this goal amid a nationwide shortage of pharmacists, as well as ongoing headwinds in the consumer space, is the challenge Wentworth faces.', 'US pharmacists, which are licensed by states, have varying degrees of medical authority depending on the state they practice in. Walgreens is in the midst of lobbying Congress to pass a bill with language that would allow Medicare Part B reimbursement for pharmacists providing tests, vaccines and treatments— but would not step on state laws, a spokesperson for Walgreens clarified after the interview Thursday.', 'Wentworth acknowledged the company has faced the same problems as other pharmacies in the past few years — including having to close down more than 100 locations and pausing the buildout of smaller locations in order to better manage resources.', 'Since taking the helm, Wentworth says he has been focusing on a return to the basics. That means facing old problems — such as weak demand for front-of-store consumer items as more customers look to e-commerce and bulk buying amid inflationary pressure.', 'To that end, he recently announced internally that store managers will have more control over their stores and be incentivized to drive growth. In addition, creating a more community-based pharmacy setting — customizing the store based on the location rather than the current big box feel — on the front retail paired with the back end with ""pharmacists operating at the very top of their clinical ability"" is how Walgreens can survive the downward pressure it has faced in recent years, Wentworth said.', '""That\'s the way we\'re able to grow our underlying clinical side of our business while at the same time building trust with patients,"" he said.', 'Anjalee Khemlani is the senior health reporter at Yahoo Finance, covering all things pharma, insurance, care services, digital health, PBMs, and health policy and politics.

The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks the performance of companies with at least 25 consecutive years of dividend growth, has surged by 6.1% this year so far, with its 12-month gains coming in at 11.2%.', 'For dividend investors, the underperformance of dividend stocks in the short term is not really a matter of concern. Contrary to popular belief, investors tend to stick with their dividend investments even when these equities lag. When the market’s focus was on the tech rally last year, investors held on to their dividend investments. This sentiment was also affirmed by David Harrell, who serves as the editor of Morningstar DividendInvestor. Here are some of his comments:', '“And when you have a more growth-oriented environment as we’ve had recently, certainly in 2023, dividend stocks are going to lag. But at the same time, dividend investors aren’t necessarily focusing on this horse race on a monthly or an annual basis like, well, are dividend stocks lagging the broad market or outperforming the broad market? Most of those investors, I believe, are focused on getting that yield from the portfolio. So, they’re getting the yield and generally hopefully getting some capital appreciation as well. So, as long as those yields are remaining strong for their portfolios, I don’t think it’s necessarily a concern.”', 'This optimistic outlook from analysts comes from the previous performance of dividend stocks. Over the years, dividend stocks have outperformed their non-dividend counterparts, particularly in certain market conditions. In our article titled 25 Things Every Dividend Investor Should Know, we referred to data from Hartford Funds, highlighting the returns of dividend stocks relative to non-dividend stocks. The report revealed that from 1973 to 2023, dividend-paying companies delivered an annual average return of 9.17%, compared with 4.27% gains of companies that do not pay dividends. The report also mentioned that during this period, the companies that maintained their dividend payments also surpassed non-dividend companies, delivering a 6.74% return. This shows that dividend income has been an important aspect of overall returns in the past.', 'Dividend investing primarily focuses on seeking out stocks with high yields and strong dividend growth streaks. Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), and AbbVie Inc (NYSE:ABBV) are some of the strong dividend growers in the market, having raised their payouts for decades. Companies that keep on increasing their payouts have shown stellar performance in the past, especially during market downturns. From May 2005 to December 2023, the Dividend Aristocrat Index returned 11.5% in periods of high interest rates, outperforming high dividend yield stocks, which gained 10.46%.', 'In view of these arguments, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks to buy according to analysts.', 'Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay', 'Our Methodology:', 'To compile this article, we first scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 933 hedge funds, as of Q4 2023 and picked stocks known for their consistent dividend track records and sustained shareholder payouts over an extended period.

This slightly higher rate would turn these weekly $8 additions into $344,000 over the same time.', ""Best yet for investors, companies that offer these market-beating traits can be found all around us. Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) and The Hershey Company (NYSE: HSY) are two great examples hiding in plain sight. Here's what makes these two juggernauts the smartest dividend stocks to buy with $400."", ""Home to over 38,000 stores globally -- half of them franchised and half company-owned -- it may seem like there aren't many chapters left in Starbucks' growth story. However, with sales growing by 8% in the first quarter and management guiding for 4% store count growth over the long term, Starbucks' maturing operations shouldn't be avoided by investors."", ""Led by its immense brand power, which Kantar Brandz ranks higher than Walt Disney, Walmart, and TikTok, the company grew its rewards membership by 13% to 34.3 million people in Q1. This ranking is worth noting since companies on Kantar Brandz's Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands list have outperformed the S&P 500 by two percentage points annually since 2006."", 'On top of this, Statista recently showed that Starbucks remained the favorite coffee brand among Gen Z and Millennials, highlighting that this popularity could continue for decades.', ""Powered by this loyal fan base of 34 million members, the company generates a return on invested capital (ROIC) of 63%. Measuring Starbucks' profitability compared to its debt and equity, this high ROIC shows that the company is masterful at using its capital to expand globally. As this article shows, companies with a ROIC in the top two quintiles of the Motley Fool Investable Stock Universe -- like Starbucks -- have proven to be an outperforming proposition over the long term."", ""Despite this impressive profitability, the company's ties to China -- which accounts for 17% of its store locations -- continue to pose a geopolitical risk, serving as one of the catalysts for Starbucks' recent share price struggles. However, the negative sentiment toward the company may be overdone, as it trades at one of its most attractive valuations of the last decade."", ""Starbucks stocks pays a 2.4% dividend yield that is near decades-long highs yet well below its 4.1% earnings yield. Investors should expect Starbucks' 13-year streak of dividend increases to continue far into the future. Though sales growth has slowed, these well-funded and growing dividends, the company's declining share count, industry-leading brand, and top-tier ROIC combine to make Starbucks an excellent candidate for investors to buy with $400."", 'Guiding for sales growth of 2% to 3% and flat earnings-per-share (EPS) growth in 2024, Hershey continued its recent run of disappointing the market. With the shares down 30% from their all-time highs, the company has a litany of headwinds facing its operations. The first and most immediate issue is skyrocketing cocoa and sugar prices, which have risen 153% and 58% since 2019, respectively.', ""Due to heavy rain in West Africa, cocoa prices have spiked over 120% in the last 15 months alone. Considering this dramatic increase in the cost of its core ingredients, Hershey's flat EPS projection for 2024 seems rather promising -- especially after growing profits by 14% last year."", ""Adding to these pricing difficulties, the company recently launched new capacity expansion projects alongside implementing a new enterprise resource planning system, boosting its capital expenditures (CapEx) to a level it hasn't seen this century."", ""Despite these challenges, Hershey's has maintained a net profit margin of 17% and an ROIC of 22%. This incredible feat may indicate a wide moat surrounding the company's operations, as it has thus far been able to pass along the majority of these higher expenses to customers without losing their faith. According to a Statista brand awareness study, the company's Reese's, Hershey's, and Kit Kat labels all ranked among the top five most recognizable candy brands in the U.S. in 2023."", ""Driven by Hershey's brand power and persistent profitability in the face of significant headwinds, investors can reasonably imagine the company extending its 14-year dividend increase streak. Paying a 2.5% yield that only uses 48% of the company's net profits, Hershey raised its dividend by 15% in 2023."", ""Trading at a reasonable 21 times earnings, Hershey is home to a long list of market-beating indicators, much like its consumer goods peer, Starbucks.

You could do it by sector. Or growth stocks versus value stocks. Or small cap versus large cap.

But Nvidia predominantly sells to businesses, while Apple is more consumer-facing.', 'Some -- though not all -- consumer-facing companies are struggling, while business-facing companies are hitting record highs. The economy as a whole is doing well, but not as well if you look through the lens of the consumer.', 'The industrial sector has quietly hit an all-time high, led by surging profits from heavy equipment and special machinery manufactures like General Electric and Caterpillar. Meanwhile, a more consumer-facing company, United Parcel Service, which is one of the largest indusial companies by market cap, is hovering around a three-year low. The divergence within the industrial sector is an allegory for the broader market.', 'Many companies rely on consumer discretionary spending and brand power to convince consumers to pay up for their products. Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) is much more expensive than coffee and tea from a grocery store. Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) charge far more for their shoes and apparel than non-name-brand alternatives. Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) has brought the cost of its cars down, but there are still more affordable options.

Starbucks and Nike are within 5% of their 52-week lows. And all five companies have lost considerable value in 2024 compared to strong gains in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite.', 'Despite being in different industries, the challenges of these companies are actually quite similar.', 'Nike has been cutting inventory so it is less exposed to slowing consumer demand. Lululemon delivered blowout results, but guidance was light due to a challenging consumer environment that includes concerns about the economy and diverting spending toward services and experiences over goods. Since reporting earnings on March 21, Nike stock is down over 8% and Lululemon is down over 19%.', 'Starbucks has exhibited impressive pricing power that has offset inflationary impacts and has led to record sales. But cost concerns remain, namely from higher wages and unionization efforts that could hurt its margins. Starbucks is doing well internationally, but a lot of its store growth over the next few years is centered on China, which has been facing a slowdown.', ""Apple and Tesla have been particularly vulnerable to the China slowdown. Apple's growth has slowed in the U.S. and most of its emerging markets, but it's still putting up record results. However, sales have fallen by double-digit percentages in China, which is Apple's second-most-important market outside the U.S. And aside from economic woes, Apple is also facing steep competition from Huawei and others that are aiming to take market share from Apple in China."", ""Tesla has seen its margins collapse in the face of slowing demand and price cuts. It's also facing heated competition in China, its second-largest market, from BYD and other competitors. Meanwhile, legacy automakers like Toyota are having success with hybrid vehicles over pure-play EVs -- challenging Tesla's business model. Earnings are projected to be lower in the next 12 months than the previous 12 months, signaling that Telsa is in store for negative growth over the short term."", 'Different sectors tend to outperform or underperform the S&P 500 based on the business cycle, valuation, investor sentiment, and other factors. What makes 2024 unique is that many sectors are doing well, but there are major industry-leading companies that tell a completely different story.', 'The broader market can keep going up even if consumer-facing companies remain challenged, because businesses are doing well and could accelerate growth if interest rates fall later in the year.', ""In most cases, if an industry leader is underperforming it's because it has high exposure to consumer spending and/or China.

In fact, AWS will be one of the first cloud firms to offer access to the GB200 Grace Blackwell Superchip. Given Amazon’s seemingly insatiable appetite for AI computing, I do not doubt AWS will continue to be a massive growth driver.', 'Unlike SNPS stock, I view AMZN stock as fairly valued at around 42.2 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). AWS is about to get a growth jolt. And it could catch investors off-guard should demand for GB200 be stronger than expected.', 'Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) stock has more than doubled in the past two years. With no signs of slowing down, the chip design firm stands out as one of the AI-harnessing momentum plays fit for growth investors. The stock trades at 83.3 times trailing price-to-earnings, making it one of the pricier AI stocks in this piece.', 'The Nvidia partnership could continue to deliver as Cadence seeks more performance gains from the very best that accelerated computing has to offer. Apart from embracing the latest and greatest Nvidia chips, Cadence also stands to benefit as it teams up with Nvidia to work on various advanced solutions across a wide range of industries. Undoubtedly, Cadence seems to be going all-in on the Nvidia platform.', 'As efforts begin to pay off, though, it will be interesting to see what investors’ reactions will be. Like Synopsys, CDNS stock is already incredibly expensive. As such, I’d be more interested in buying on a pullback than chasing it at all-time highs.', 'On the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Amazon.

The stock was oversubscribed by as much as five times, and a post-IPO bump was virtually guaranteed.', 'However, IPOs like Reddit are often poor long-term bets. On average, the 143 largest tech IPOs of the past decade have underperformed the market by 18%, driven by laggards like Fitbit and King Games. Backdoor special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) listings have performed even worse, with nine out of 10 companies trading below their initial merger prices.', 'That’s because corporate insiders have every incentive to pump these stocks in early trading days, allowing them to cash out at the highest possible valuations. They will often overpromise right as their shares hit the market, leaving public investors with overvalued companies that have little chance of hitting these lofty targets.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'That’s why I tend to favor Perpetual Money Machines, the high-returning companies like Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) that can turn small sums into fortunes, given a long enough horizon. These companies have the ability to generate high returns, and have the discipline to continue reinvesting into their businesses. And as for fresh IPOs, I seek out companies where insiders maintain a meaningful stake.', 'This week, our writers and I explore three of these long-term bets that could triple by 2030.', 'Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com', 'Shares of Yum China (NYSE:YUMC) have fallen 40% in the past year over fears of a Chinese economic slowdown. The company operates over 14,000 restaurants in over 2,000 Chinese cities and towns, and a broad real estate slowdown has put consumer-facing stocks on the back foot.', 'Nevertheless, Yum China remains the most dominant restaurant chain in a fast-growing market. KFC and Pizza Hut continue to rank ahead of competitors in AC Nielsen brand image studies, and the restaurant firm expects to have 20,000 stores in service by 2026. As Morningstar analysts note, restaurant chains in China still account for just 18% of total restaurant spending, compared to 61% in the U.S. and 34% worldwide.', 'Margins at Yum China also remain intact; analysts expect net income margins to remain above 7% this year and for return on invested capital to hit 17%. A successful expansion into the Lavazza coffee concept could drive margins up even further, since successful coffee stores typically have even higher returns on investment than restaurants.', 'That’s why InvestorPlace.com writer Ian Bezek writes in a recent update that Yum China could see a quick turn in fortunes.', 'While the Chinese consumer is currently struggling, fast food tends to hold up alright during economic downturns. To that point, analysts see Yum China growing earnings per share 10% in 2024, and growth accelerating to 14% in 2025. This comes from a starting point of less than 20 times forward earnings…', 'When sentiment around Chinese stocks improves, Yum China shares should surge.', 'Even better, Yum China’s recent price decline now values the firm at just 18x forward earnings. That’s well below its long-term average of 25x and a steal given a 20%-plus earnings growth rate. Given the company’s steady growth, strong profits, and wide “moat,” shares will likely rise threefold by the end of this decade.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'Silicon Valley-based Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) has long been a leader in electronic design automation (EDA), the software that creates and tests new semiconductor chip designs. Even the most basic CPUs now have millions of transistors, and these need to be tested for usability, security, and efficiency. Synopsys splits the EDA market with Cadence Design Systems (NASDAQ:CDNS) and Siemens subsidiary Mentor.', 'Today, the increasing complexity of semiconductors has turbocharged demand for Synopsys’ services. Analysts expect revenues to rise 19% this year, and for earnings per share (EPS) growth to average 20% through at least 2026.', 'That’s because modern chips must increasingly balance chip density, power consumption, and performance. Costs per transistor have not decreased as quickly as Moore’s Law has suggested. So high-end chips like Nvidia’s Blackwell chipset could cost as much as $2 million per chipset. The rise of AI on mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices will require a whole new generation of power-efficient chips that run well on batteries.', 'That’s why InvestorPlace.com writer Marc Guberti now adds Synopsys to his must-buy list.', 'While the semiconductor giant has several catalysts, a recent nod from Nvidia can generate more growth. Nvidia and Synopsys are joining forces to innovate on the future design, automation, and manufacturing of chips. Corporations have a tendency to gain value if they partner with Nvidia, but neither company needs the partnership to reward long-term shareholders.', 'Synopsys also benefits from a focus on digital integrated circuit (IC) design, a segment that’s forecast to grow faster than its analog peers. That gives the firm a growth edge over its two key rivals. Together, a 3-stage discounted cash flow model (DCF) suggests that shares of Synopsys could become worth as much as $1,800 by 2030, a 3x upside.', 'Source: Karolis Kavolelis / Shutterstock.com', 'Finally, InvestorPlace.com writer Josh Enomoto picks out Genius Sports (NYSE:GENI) to bank on the popularity of sports betting.', 'Experts see a turnaround in the current fiscal year, anticipating a per-share loss of 18 cents atop revenue of $480.59 million. These are significantly better figures than last year’s print of a loss of 32 cents and sales of just under $413 million.', 'The best part? Analysts rate GENI a unanimous strong buy with an $8.79 average price target. That’s an implied 53% upside potential, making it one of the stocks under $20 to consider.', 'In short, Genius Sports is reaping the benefits of U.S. online sports betting. The London-based firm is the sole data distributor for sports leagues that include the NFL and Premier League, and the surging popularity of apps like FanDuel and DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) is putting growth into overdrive. Analysts believe the firm will become profitable as soon as 2025. Genius Sports is also an official data provider for the MLB, NBA and others.', 'The firm is also becoming a powerhouse with AI-generated content. The company’s media segment is dedicated to providing augmented reality content to the media (i.e., the markings and overlays you see during live sports games) and recently launched its own BetVision app that personalizes these visualizations for consumers. Analysts expect this segment grow revenues as much as 25% this year.', 'Together, that suggests Genius Sports could be worth over $20 a share by the end of the decade. The company isn’t due to renegotiate its NFL contract until the 2028-29 season, giving Genius Sports plenty of time to widen its head start. And the continued legalization of online sports betting gives the firm a secular tailwind that few companies can match.', 'The three companies mentioned above will take several years to play out. History tells us that cheap stocks tend to stay cheap for a while before recovering strongly. No company scores an A+ with MarketMasterAI, a system designed to identify stocks that will rise over the next six months.', 'That’s why I’m also excited this week to tell you about Luke Lango’s latest stock-picking system, which he will outline during his special event – 2nd Trillion-Dollar A.I.

If you do not want to learn about the energy drinks market overview. head straight to the 5 Top Selling Energy Drink Brands in the US.', 'The global energy drinks market is experiencing impressive growth and is projected to reach USD 188.15 billion by\xa02031, with a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.47% from 2023 to 2031. This market expansion is driven by energy drinks as they expand, known for their immediate energy, mental stimulation, and improved physical fitness capabilities.\xa0', 'Energy drinks are incredibly popular everywhere; millions of people frequently drink them. Even while exact global addiction statistics are hard to come by, research shows that energy drink use is quite common, especially among young adults. Approximately\xa034%\xa0of college students admit to regularly consuming these drinks due to their ability to increase energy, improve concentration, and enhance athletic performance.\xa0\xa0', 'When we zoom in on the US, we see that it is the biggest regional market and accounted for nearly\xa035% of worldwide revenue in 2021. According to CDC estimates, between 30 and 50 percent of teenagers and young people in the US frequently consume energy drinks. Tens of millions of people in the US alone are part of this enormous consumer base, who often turn to energy drinks to meet their energy demands and improve their performance.\xa0', 'Energy drinks hold a significant market\xa0share\xa0of 16% to 18% in the non-alcoholic beverage category, where they battle intensely. The main competitors are ready-to-drink teas and sodas, which are very competitive because of their high caffeine and antioxidant content. Furthermore, the new trend of energy shots, which is especially popular in developing nations, has boosted competition and is being driven by rising demand in major countries like the US and the UK. As a result, the energy drink sector is growing.\xa0', ""Energy drink sales in the United States have increased dramatically in recent years, as seen by the industry's current valuation of $21.1 billion, which is expected to rise to $22.7 billion by\xa02023. This strong increase highlights the significant and increasing demand for these drinks throughout the nation.\xa0"", 'Research suggests that there is a gender difference in the consumption of energy drinks, with men drinking them at a significantly higher rate than women. According to a report,\xa039%\xa0of Americans who drink energy drinks are men, indicating a market that is biased in favor of men.\xa0', 'Energy drinks are distinguished from other coffee-flavored drinks by having a notably higher caffeine content. Energy drinks can have anywhere from 70 to 250 mg of caffeine per container, whereas a standard cup of coffee has about 100 mg and a typical soda has about 35 mg. Their increased caffeine level is a major factor in their appeal since it gives customers a stronger energy boost.\xa0', ""However, worries about potential negative health effects have been raised by energy drinks' high caffeine content. These\xa0include\xa0elevated blood pressure, heart rate, and risk-taking actions like binge drinking. These possible hazards highlight how important it is to think about the health effects of consuming energy drinks, especially for younger customers.\xa0"", 'The companies that are at the forefront of the global energy drinks market include Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST), PepsiCo, Inc., National Beverage Corp. (NASDAQ:FIZZ), and The Coca-Cola Company. These companies have been largely dominating the market with their great products.\xa0\xa0', 'Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) is the second-biggest industry player in the world, With a 39% market share, only behind Red Bull. The company, which was first founded in 1935 as the family-run juice company Hansen\'s, switched to energy drinks in 1997 with the introduction of ""Hansen\'s Energy"" and rebranded as Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST) in 2012. Among the noteworthy breakthroughs include the launch of the Monster Energy brand in 2002, the growth into new markets with the launch of Reign Total Body Fuel and Reign Storm, and the 2022 acquisition of Bang Energy. Monster Beverage Corporation (NASDAQ:MNST)\'s success has been driven by clever marketing strategies, especially in action sports, and a relationship with Coca-Cola, under the direction of co-CEOs Rodney Sacks and Hilton Schlosberg.\xa0\xa0', 'In terms of finances, Monster Beverage announced record-breaking fourth-quarter net sales in 2023 of $1.73 billion, up 14.4% from the previous year. The net income increased by 21.6% to $367.0 million, while the gross profit increased to 54.2% of net sales. 36.8% of total net sales came from international markets, which saw a significant increase across several countries.\xa0\xa0', ""On the other hand, National Beverage Corp. (NASDAQ:FIZZ), a major competitor in the global energy drink market, has unveiled some noteworthy developments, to strengthen its position. Notably, the company's Rip It brand has grown significantly, and OCA, a new organic energy drink, demonstrates a dedication to product diversity with its distinct flavor of prickly pear and lime. In addition, efforts to satisfy consumer desire for healthier options are seen in the introduction of sugar-free and calorie-free products under the Rockstar Energy Drink brand that are infused with hemp oil and vitamin B.\xa0\xa0"", ""National Beverage Corp. (NASDAQ:FIZZ) revealed impressive financial success for the fourth quarter and the upcoming fiscal year 2023. Record-breaking Q4 net sales of $287 million were achieved, while gross margins rose to 36% of sales. Several factors have contributed to this achievement, including the use of price to offset cost increases, a persistent focus on LaCroix's unique offers, the successful introduction of new products such as Shasta Zero Sugar variations, and efficient marketing techniques.\xa0"", 'A hand pouring a cool can of a carbonated non-alcoholic beverage with a smiley face on it.', '\xa0', 'For our methodology, we have ranked the top-selling energy drink brands in the US based on the dollar sales of these drinks for 52 weeks ending in April 2023. For the accuracy of data, we relied on Caffeine Former.\xa0', '\xa0Here is our list of the 15 top-selling energy drink brands in the US.', 'Total Dollar Sales: $43 million', 'With sales surpassing $1.2 billion in 2023, Prime—co-founded by Logan Paul and KSI—ranks among the\xa0fastest-growing beverage companies\xa0ever. Major sports sponsorships with the Los Angeles Dodgers of Major League Baseball, Arsenal FC, and the UFC have propelled its rise from\xa0$250 million\xa0in revenue in 2022. With 40 million Instagram followers combined, Prime makes extensive use of social media. There have been over 16.1 billion views on the TikTok hashtag.\xa0\xa0', 'Total Dollar Sales: $58 million', ""The Campbell Soup Company introduced V8 in 2012 as a better energy drink choice. It includes vitamins and a moderate amount of caffeine from black and green tea in its V8 energy range. It's seen as healthier even if certain additives, like sucralose, have caused controversy. However, others are concerned about its caffeine content, particularly for young users. V8's popularity is clear from its approximately 6% sales gain in 2020. While there is competition in the US energy drink business as a whole, V8 faces off against industry heavyweights like Red Bull, Monster, and Rockstar.\xa0\xa0"", 'Total Dollar Sales: $117 million', 'Customers looking for a pick-me-up often choose Full Throttle, one of the top selling energy drink brands in the US\xa0made by Coca-Cola, because of its strong taste and powerful energy boost.

The reason for MTN DEW's success is its zesty taste, strong advertising, and devoted fan base. MTN DEW's standing as a\xa0top energy drink brand\xa0has been solidified by PepsiCo's commitment to growing the brand, which includes variations including MTN DEW Rise Energy.\xa0\xa0"", 'Total Dollar Sales: $389 million', 'Ghost energy drinks come in sugar-free varieties, tempting flavors including Cherry Limeade and Warheads Sour Watermelon, and 200 mg of caffeine each can. Reviews laud their flavor and potency, citing a quick and pure energy surge. Although not regarded as ""healthy,"" they are thought to be acceptable for persons in good health when consumed in moderation; caution is suggested to avoid going over the 400 mg daily limit of caffeine.\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'Total Dollar Sales: $401 million', 'Compared to other brands, CQ Energy Drink has less sugar and more natural components like quercetin and herbal extracts, which places C4 among the top selling energy drink brands in the US.

And while it doesn't break out revenue from Canada, distribution is limited north of the border, meaning this is mostly U.S. revenue."", 'To be clear, Celsius still has room for growth in the U.S. and is pursuing certain opportunities. Its distribution deal with PepsiCo is particularly helpful, getting the upstart brand in the door with food-service companies, college campuses, hotels, healthcare facilities, and more.', ""That said, Celsius' distribution is much fuller now than it was five years ago and it will reach a saturation point eventually.

Luluemon was in fact the worst performer of the month on the S&P 500, as the stock fell 15.8% on March 22 after it reported fourth-quarter earnings.', 'Lululemon delivered another solid quarter of growth with revenue up 16% year over year to $3.21 billion, ahead of expectations, and adjusted earnings per share rose 20% to $5.29, which also beat estimates.', 'However, Lululemon is a high-priced stock, and those tend to fall on the slightest hint of a problem. While the fourth-quarter results were strong, guidance for 2024 disappointed. The company forecasted revenue growth slowing to 10%-11% year over year to $10.7 billion-$10.8 billion, adjusted for the extra week in the calendar, which missed estimates at $10.9 billion. It expects earnings per share of $14.00-14.20, up 16% year over year at the midpoint.', ""Lululemon's sell-off seems to be more about valuation rather than a fundamental problem with the business. The business is still performing well, and guidance is not actual results, so investors should be hesitant about overreacting to it. The stock is worth buying on the dip."", ""A weak earnings report wasn't the culprit in Southwest Airlines' (NYSE: LUV)\xa0slide last month. Instead, the sell-off in Southwest came as the company cut its guidance in response to the quality control crisis at Boeing."", 'Southwest cut its revenue per available seat mile (RASM) from a 2.5%-4.5% increase to flat to 2%. It also raised its cost guidance slightly for both operations and fuel.', 'Boeing reduced its expected aircraft deliveries to Southwest from 79 to 46, which is likely to impact growth over the rest of the year.', 'The crisis at Boeing has introduced a high level of uncertainty into the airline industry and Southwest. Considering that, investors are better off waiting for more clarity until they invest in the stock.', ""Pet pharmaceuticals leader Zoetis (NYSE: ZTS) also struggled last month, though, unlike Southwest and Lululemon, it didn't fall on a specific event."", 'Instead, Zoetis seemed to slip on broader weakness in the pet industry as a number of pet stocks were down last month.', 'Zoetis disappointed in its fourth-quarter earnings report in February as the company missed estimates on the bottom line and offered weak guidance for 2024, showing that it expects the post-pandemic headwinds in the pet industry to persist.', 'Among the challenges weighing on the stock is a European antitrust investigation into whether Zoetis prevented the launch of a rival pain medicine for dogs. The news puts Zoetis at risk of a sizable fine.', 'Even after the sell-off, Zoetis shares look expensive at a price-to-earnings ratio of more than 30.

Creating a similarly prominent group in another sector like healthcare isn\'t an exact science. So, some might not agree with the list below. That said, though, all seven healthcare stocks in my ""Magnificent Seven"" of the industry share the following characteristics. First, they are all leaders in their respective niches.', 'Second, they have soundly outperformed the market over the past decade. Third, they all have solid long-term prospects. With that said, here is my Magnificent Seven of healthcare stocks: Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX), AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG), HCA Healthcare (NYSE: HCA), and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH).', ""It makes sense to group these two pharmaceutical giants. Both are leaders in the diabetes and obesity care markets, where they have been competing for decades. Eli Lilly earned approval last year for Zepbound, an anti-obesity treatment that should go on to generate billions in revenue. Novo Nordisk's competitor in this area, Wegovy, is still growing its sales at an incredible pace. Further, both drugmakers have incredibly deep pipelines."", ""Novo Nordisk is still looking to innovate in the obesity market. It recently reported positive results from a phase 1 study for a promising candidate. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly earned approval for several new products last year. It is awaiting word from U.S. regulators for donanemab, a potential Alzheimer's disease therapy. Eli Lilly also delivered promising phase 1 results for a gene therapy that could treat hearing loss."", 'Both companies should continue delivering excellent financial results and stock market performances. Expect both to be trillion-dollar stocks within a decade.', ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals has been riding the wave of its dominance in the market for therapies that treat a rare disease called cystic fibrosis (CF). Though highly innovative in this area, in which it continues to make headway, the biotech is now looking for diversification. Reducing its exposure to its core therapeutic area isn't a bad idea. Vertex Pharmaceuticals recently earned approval for a gene-editing treatment called Casgevy."", 'It developed this therapy in collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics. Casgevy is a one-time curative therapy for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, two rare blood diseases that have been incredibly difficult to treat or manage. This milestone was a significant breakthrough for Vertex, but more are coming. The drugmaker is inching closer to launching yet another CF medicine and a brand-new therapy for acute pain.', 'Vertex has several key products in its pipeline as well. The biotech looks set to maintain its momentum for a long time.', 'AbbVie became a stand-alone company in January 2013 when it split from Abbott Laboratories. Since then, the drugmaker has been a market-beater, largely thanks to its superstar immunology drug, Humira. The rheumatoid arthritis medicine ran out of patent exclusivity last year, but AbbVie is managing what is one of the most important patent cliffs in the history of the industry (Humira is the best-selling drug ever) pretty well.', ""Though sales have been declining since last year, management expects that to change by 2025. AbbVie's Skyrizi and Rinvoq are Humira's heirs. Finding a duo of medicines that can replace $21.2 billion in annual peak sales is difficult, but Skyrizi and Rinvoq will exceed that total. Management expects them to rack up combined sales of $27 billion by 2027."", ""That speaks volumes about AbbVie's innovative potential, especially in immunology. The company has other promising products and pipeline candidates, and it is a Dividend King. Investors, including income-seekers, can't go wrong with this stock."", ""Intuitive Surgical is the company behind the da Vinci system, a robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) device. The healthcare leader has pioneered the use of RAS machines, which allow surgeons to perform minimally invasive surgeries. Unlike with open surgeries, doctors don't need to make large incisions to access and get a full view of the organs they are operating on. The da Vinci system is equipped with tiny instruments that boast incredible maneuverability."", ""Intuitive Surgical had 8,606 of its da Vinci systems installed as of the end of 2023. As long as demand for these machines grows and the volume of procedures performed with them increases, Intuitive Surgical's revenue and earnings should continue to move in the right direction. Given the aging population and the fact that only 5% of surgeries that could be performed robotically currently are, it looks like Intuitive Surgical has a long runway for growth."", 'UnitedHealth Group and HCA Healthcare are two important players in the U.S. healthcare system. The former is one of the largest health insurers in the country and offers pharmacy management solutions and data and analytics services to other insurers through its subsidiary Optum. HCA Healthcare is one of the largest hospital chains in the country, with facilities that span much of the U.S., although it is particularly concentrated in Florida and Texas. Though both companies saw their businesses disrupted during the worst of the pandemic and suffered somewhat due to economic issues that followed, their operations are resilient.', ""Pandemic-related troubles have mostly subsided. UnitedHealth Group and HCA Healthcare continue to march forward, and both should also benefit from the aging population. UnitedHealth Group's Optum will see a rise in demand for the services it offers as insurance claims rise, while HCA Healthcare's occupancy rates and volume of medical care services will also move in the right direction. In short, both stocks have plenty of growth fuel left in their tanks."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Eli Lilly wasn’t one of them.

That makes them a desirable choice to buy for risk-averse investors, particularly those approaching retirement. Plus, the markets are in an upbeat mood this year, with a total return of 10% year-to-date, with the performance comprising roughly a 10% price return and a 0.4% dividend return\u200b.', 'With the Fed looking to cut interest rates this year, the stock market will continue its upward trend. To capitalize on this price momentum, the right move is to seek out dividend stocks to buy. Especially those trading at a 52-week low. These dividend stocks provide access to a reliable income stream, reduced volatility, and, at times, a lower tax bill.', 'The three stocks we will profile are all trading near their 52-week lows. In two cases, REITs are featured, which have to distribute the bulk of their earnings in the shape of dividends. To capitalize on America’s aging population, the first pick will appeal to you. For investors seeking access to the metropolitan areas known as the “sun belt,” the other REIT is highly recommended.

Two major culprits here are leverage and FFO performance.', 'UHT’s debt-to-equity ratio is 1.84, ranking it lower than about 88% of the 675 companies in the REIT industry. Thanks to the Fed hikes, interest expenses are also ballooning, which will concern risk-averse investors. However, with three rate cuts expected this year, this situation will improve.', 'Additionally, funds from operations (FFO) dropped 9% in 2023, indicating a consistent downward trend over time. The fall in FFO was ascribed to increasing vacancy costs, difficulties in passing on rent increases to renters, and higher interest payments.', 'The REIT definitely needs to exercise tighter control over its operational costs if it wants to curry favor with investors again.

If you want to skip our coverage of the latest happenings surrounding one of America's most widely followed stock indexes, then you can take a look at the 5 Best S&P 500 Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\xa0"", 'The S&P 500 has had a great year so far. The flagship stock index, which was quite jittery a little over a year back, has been doing well as of late. This performance comes after the tail end of 2022 which saw analysts and investors all around worried about a recession in the U.S. due to high interest rates. However, 2023 came with a multitude of surprises in the form of artificial intelligence, falling inflation, and a growing economy - all of which ended up putting the bears to rest.', ""So how great has the first quarter of 2024 been for the S&P 500? Well, for starters, the index has set a new record this year. In fact, while the index has been regularly setting records in 2024, its latest record came just before the Easter holiday long weekend. This saw the S&P 500 set a new closing record of 5,245 - ensuring that the index comfortably remains above the coveted benchmark of 5,000 points that most folks would have thought was impossible at the close of 2022 and in an era marked by 'expensive' and difficult to get cash due to high interest rates."", 'The next question to ask is, why is the S&P 500 setting new records? After all, despite the ongoing euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence, the close of Q1 2024 has also seen investors re calibrate their expectations for the Federal Reserve potentially reducing the bank rate. These expectations have shifted for the worse, with most folks now expecting the rate cuts to start later than originally expected.', ""Well, several macroeconomic data points have led to the S&P setting new records. For instance, investors were dealt with a nice surprise in the form of an upward GDP growth revision for Q4 2023 which saw the new estimate grow to sit at 3.4% from an earlier 3.2%. Additionally, even though the commercial real estate sector continues to feel the pinch from a massive shakeup in the bond market and the interest rate environment, home sales in America grew by 1.6% in February to outpace estimates of a 1.5% growth. Another data point that is yet to be reflected in the S&P 500 is the Fed's preferred inflation indication, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. The latest data shows that as of February 2024, inflation in the U.S. stood at 2.5% - meeting forecasts and being more in tune with the Fed's preferred 2% reading."", ""Digging deeper, some of the stocks that have fueled the S&P 500's 11% year to date gains are Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG), and of course, Wall Street's A.I. darling, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The three stocks are up 254%, 60%, and 88% year to date, and the fact that two out of three of the S&P 500's best performing stocks in the first quarter of 2024 are technology companies shows how artificial intelligence has fundamentally shifted stock market valuations. While everyone knows that it's NVIDIA's high end GPUs that have injected steroids into its share price, for Super Micro and Constellation Energy, the catalysts were a second quarter earnings beat and guidance raise for the former and a 2024 forecast beat for the latter."", ""When it comes to investing, while the retail camp is often left reacting to the news, hedge funds spend countless hours and vast sums of money picking out the right set of stocks. As the first quarter of 2024 comes to a close, let's see what the hedge funds were saying about NVIDIA in the fourth quarter of 2023."", ""An excerpt from Polen Capital's investor letter for the period is as follows:"", 'NVIDIA shares rocketed higher by well over 200% in 2023 although they slightly underperformed our Portfolio and the Russell 1000 Growth in the fourth quarter. Generative AI has been a huge boon for NVIDIA as the use of LLMs like ChatGPT and others requires tremendous processing power that, today, is mostly provided by NVIDIA’s GPUs. All large cloud service providers, AI factories, and many large consumer internet companies are laying the foundation for generative AI by deploying NVIDIA GPUs and other parallel processing chips to be able to do large scale generative AI either for internal use (i.e., Meta) or as a service for others (i.e., AI factories) or both (cloud service providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).', 'Given many of NVIDIA’s customers or its end customers are still very much in the experimentation phase with generative AI, it is unclear how sustainable the current demand for GPUs truly is. At the same time, it is known that NVIDIA has historically been highly cyclical. By the end of 2024, we believe NVIDIA will already account for roughly half the market for datacenter chips, servers, and networking equipment, which is unprecedented. Even though the valuation at 25x forward earnings doesn’t look very demanding at first glance, it assumes NVIDIA will own virtually the entire datacenter chip market in just the next few years and will sustain year-on-year growth despite being a cyclical business that is currently experiencing much higher new peak.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at which S&P 500 stocks analysts can't stop talking about. A couple of notable picks are Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), and Biogen Inc. (NASDAQ:BIIB)."", 'A customer using a mobile banking app at home to securely transfer money.', 'Our Methodology', 'To make our list of the S&P 500 stocks to buy according to analysts, we ranked the stocks in the index by the average share price target percentage upside and picked out the top stocks.', 'For these top S&P 500 stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

And keeping this background in mind, it's encouraging that the company launched its own flagship Disney+ streaming service in November 2019.

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) shareholders have seen the share price rise 99% over three years, well in excess of the market return (16%, not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 65% , including dividends ."", ""On the back of a solid 7-day performance, let's check what role the company's fundamentals have played in driving long term shareholder returns."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Phillips 66 ', 'In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.', ""Phillips 66 became profitable within the last three years. That would generally be considered a positive, so we'd expect the share price to be up."", 'You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).', ""We know that Phillips 66 has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? Take a more thorough look at Phillips 66's financial health with this free report on its balance sheet."", 'When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Phillips 66 the TSR over the last 3 years was 125%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.', ""It's good to see that Phillips 66 has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 65% in the last twelve months. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 16% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Phillips 66 (including 1 which is a bit concerning) ."", 'If you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the silver industry, head directly to 5 Best Silver ETFs To Buy.', ""According to a report from the Silver Institute, demand for global silver is expected to reach 1.2 billion ounces in 2024, the second-highest quantity ever recorded. The institute attributes this increase to stronger industrial usage, which is set to reach a new annual high this year. Michael DiRienzo, the executive director of the Silver Institute, has shown optimism regarding silver's prospects, predicting that silver prices could reach $30 per ounce, a level not seen in a decade. He commented:"", '“We think silver will have a terrific year, especially in terms of demand.”', 'The Silver Institute anticipates a 9% increase in demand for silverware and a 6% boost in jewelry demand this year, with India projected to be the driving force behind the rise in jewelry purchases. Consumer electronics industry is expected to recover, which would contribute to increased demand for silver. In the short term, however, the institute acknowledges potential headwinds from a slowing Chinese economy and decreased likelihood of early US interest rate cuts, which could have an impact on institutional investment in silver. In spite of that, many market analysts believe that the US Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates in the second half of 2024, which could benefit silver prices. Silver prices tend to have an inverse relationship with interest rates, as higher interest rates make precious metals like silver and gold less attractive compared to interest-bearing investments like bonds. Recognized for its sensitivity to economic changes and higher volatility compared to gold, silver usually outperforms gold during periods of economic expansion but underperforms during economic downturns. Randy Smallwood, CEO of Wheaton Precious Metals, is of the view that gold prices may rise first, followed by a rapid increase in silver prices. He believes that silver has the potential to reach $50 per ounce, but only after gold exceeds $2,200 per ounce.', 'James Steel, HSBC Chief Precious Metals Analyst, told Bloomberg in an interview:', '“We are more positive on silver, platinum, and palladium than we are for gold. We are looking for higher prices in all three. In the case of silver, it has enormous applications environmentally… Almost everything in a hospital that you go into now is coated in a thin layer of silver that you can’t see. (It is) anti-bacterial. Even flak jackets are sewn in silver.”', ""The global silver market is projected to achieve a compound annual growth rate of around 9.83% by the year 2030. The market has consistently grown due to the widespread use of silver, not just in jewelry but also in other applications such as vessels and chemical processes. The growth of the silver industry is attributed to several factors. The production of silverware, ornaments, and its use in chemical processes has been a significant driver. Additionally, silver's role in solar photovoltaic and electrical appliances for conduction and insulation has contributed to the market growth. The increasing use of silver in oxide batteries has also contributed to the industry’s expansion. Predictions for the silver market suggest that major industry players are working on incorporating innovative technologies into silver production, enhancing its appeal to consumers. Regulatory authorities play an important role in guaranteeing the quality and legitimacy of silver products, which fosters transparency in the commodity market. Consumers, along with industry stakeholders such as manufacturers and retailers, play a significant role in upholding these standards."", ""In the International Energy Agency's plan to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, the demand for silver in solar photovoltaic manufacturing could outdo 30% of the total global silver production in 2020 by the year 2030. Recycling panels at the end of their life could meet over 20% of the solar PV industry's demand for aluminum, copper, glass, and silicon, and nearly 70% for silver between 2040 and 2050, as per the IEA's roadmap."", 'In this article, we discuss some of the best silver ETFs that provide investors with access to stocks like Franco-Nevada Corporation (NYSE:FNV), BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP), and Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM).', 'Our Methodology', 'We curated our list of the best silver ETFs by choosing consensus picks from multiple credible websites.

The flagship stock index, which was quite jittery a little over a year back, has been doing well as of late. This performance comes after the tail end of 2022 which saw analysts and investors all around worried about a recession in the U.S. due to high interest rates. However, 2023 came with a multitude of surprises in the form of artificial intelligence, falling inflation, and a growing economy - all of which ended up putting the bears to rest.', ""So how great has the first quarter of 2024 been for the S&P 500? Well, for starters, the index has set a new record this year. In fact, while the index has been regularly setting records in 2024, its latest record came just before the Easter holiday long weekend. This saw the S&P 500 set a new closing record of 5,245 - ensuring that the index comfortably remains above the coveted benchmark of 5,000 points that most folks would have thought was impossible at the close of 2022 and in an era marked by 'expensive' and difficult to get cash due to high interest rates."", 'The next question to ask is, why is the S&P 500 setting new records? After all, despite the ongoing euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence, the close of Q1 2024 has also seen investors re calibrate their expectations for the Federal Reserve potentially reducing the bank rate. These expectations have shifted for the worse, with most folks now expecting the rate cuts to start later than originally expected.', ""Well, several macroeconomic data points have led to the S&P setting new records. For instance, investors were dealt with a nice surprise in the form of an upward GDP growth revision for Q4 2023 which saw the new estimate grow to sit at 3.4% from an earlier 3.2%. Additionally, even though the commercial real estate sector continues to feel the pinch from a massive shakeup in the bond market and the interest rate environment, home sales in America grew by 1.6% in February to outpace estimates of a 1.5% growth. Another data point that is yet to be reflected in the S&P 500 is the Fed's preferred inflation indication, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. The latest data shows that as of February 2024, inflation in the U.S. stood at 2.5% - meeting forecasts and being more in tune with the Fed's preferred 2% reading."", ""Digging deeper, some of the stocks that have fueled the S&P 500's 11% year to date gains are Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG), and of course, Wall Street's A.I. darling, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The three stocks are up 254%, 60%, and 88% year to date, and the fact that two out of three of the S&P 500's best performing stocks in the first quarter of 2024 are technology companies shows how artificial intelligence has fundamentally shifted stock market valuations. While everyone knows that it's NVIDIA's high end GPUs that have injected steroids into its share price, for Super Micro and Constellation Energy, the catalysts were a second quarter earnings beat and guidance raise for the former and a 2024 forecast beat for the latter."", ""When it comes to investing, while the retail camp is often left reacting to the news, hedge funds spend countless hours and vast sums of money picking out the right set of stocks. As the first quarter of 2024 comes to a close, let's see what the hedge funds were saying about NVIDIA in the fourth quarter of 2023."", ""An excerpt from Polen Capital's investor letter for the period is as follows:"", 'NVIDIA shares rocketed higher by well over 200% in 2023 although they slightly underperformed our Portfolio and the Russell 1000 Growth in the fourth quarter. Generative AI has been a huge boon for NVIDIA as the use of LLMs like ChatGPT and others requires tremendous processing power that, today, is mostly provided by NVIDIA’s GPUs. All large cloud service providers, AI factories, and many large consumer internet companies are laying the foundation for generative AI by deploying NVIDIA GPUs and other parallel processing chips to be able to do large scale generative AI either for internal use (i.e., Meta) or as a service for others (i.e., AI factories) or both (cloud service providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).', 'Given many of NVIDIA’s customers or its end customers are still very much in the experimentation phase with generative AI, it is unclear how sustainable the current demand for GPUs truly is. At the same time, it is known that NVIDIA has historically been highly cyclical. By the end of 2024, we believe NVIDIA will already account for roughly half the market for datacenter chips, servers, and networking equipment, which is unprecedented. Even though the valuation at 25x forward earnings doesn’t look very demanding at first glance, it assumes NVIDIA will own virtually the entire datacenter chip market in just the next few years and will sustain year-on-year growth despite being a cyclical business that is currently experiencing much higher new peak.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at which S&P 500 stocks analysts can't stop talking about.

It is found in small quantities within rocks and soils, with monazite, a rare earth phosphate mineral, being the primary source of this element.', 'Thorium holds significant importance as a potential alternative nuclear fuel source due to its reduced waste production and lower proliferation risks compared to uranium. Its utilization in nuclear reactors could contribute to sustainable energy production and help address environmental concerns associated with traditional fuel sources.', ""According to the World Nuclear Association, thorium is also more abundant than uranium in nature. However, it is a fertile material that requires a fissile partner like recycled plutonium to be used as fuel. It can breed uranium-233 for nuclear reactors, especially in molten salt reactors that eliminate traditional fuel processing. Despite its potential as a future primary energy source, extracting thorium's energy efficiently poses challenges and it will require substantial investments in research and development."", 'The importance of thorium in the nuclear energy industry lies in its potential to be a more abundant and efficient substitute for uranium, potentially addressing energy needs in the long term. While challenges exist, ongoing research and development efforts, particularly in countries like India and China, indicate a growing interest in utilizing thorium for nuclear power generation. As reported by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), China completed its first experimental thorium-powered nuclear reactor in August 2021.

A high yield backed by a dividend that gets cut is likely to lead to less income and a loss of capital. No thanks! This is why one of the first screens I use when looking for a stock is a company's history of increasing its dividend. Then, I look at the businesses behind the dividend. Enbridge (NYSE: ENB) and NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) both come out looking like stocks that dividend investors would want to own for the long run."", ""Canadian Enbridge is lumped together with the midstream energy sector. That's an appropriate place for it, given that around 57% of the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) comes from oil pipelines and another 28% from natural gas pipelines. It is, in fact, one of the largest midstream companies in North America, with a portfolio of energy infrastructure that would be difficult, if not impossible, to replace or replicate."", 'The pipelines and other midstream assets it owns are largely fee-driven, which results in fairly consistent cash flow regardless of what is going on with energy prices. But do the quick math -- this side of the company makes up 85% of EBITDA. The rest comes from a regulated natural gas utility (12% of EBITDA) and renewable power assets (the remainder). Regulated utilities are super boring and reliable cash flow generators, and the renewable power assets Enbridge owns are under long-term contracts.', ""There's plenty of cash flow coming in to cover the historically high 7.5% dividend yield, noting that the distributable cash flow payout ratio is comfortably in the middle of the company's target 60% to 70% range. The dividend, meanwhile, has been increased annually for 29 consecutive years. There's no indication that the dividend streak is anywhere near ending."", ""That said, Enbridge is about to get even more boring and reliable with the planned purchase of three additional regulated natural gas utilities in 2024. That will shift the business mix to 50% oil pipes, 25% gas pipes, 22% gas utilities, and 3% clean energy. Being a conservative and steady dividend payer is clearly a high priority for management. While the high yield is likely to make up the lion's share of your total return here, that should be a net positive for investors seeking to maximize the income they generate from their portfolios."", ""Not everyone is looking for stocks that have high yields; some prefer to own companies that reward income investors with rapid dividend growth. That is exactly what you'll get with NextEra Energy, one of the largest utilities in the United States. A high-dividend-growth utility may sound too good to be true, but NextEra Energy's dividend has been increased at a 10% annualized clip over the past decade. That's pretty good for any company, but extra impressive for a utility. In fact, half that dividend growth rate would be strong for a utility!"", ""Better yet, NextEra Energy's management team is projecting dividend growth to be around 10% per year all the way out to 2026. So there are more sizable dividend hikes to come, backed by earnings growth of between 6% and 8% a year. For reference, the dividend has been increased each year for 29 consecutive years, and the dividend yield is a historically high 3.3% or so right now. While a 3.3% yield won't excite income-focused investors, combined with the robust dividend growth rate, NextEra Energy should be quite alluring to dividend growth and growth and income investors."", ""The key to the growth story here is that NextEra Energy actually mixes a slow and steady regulated utility operation with a fast growing renewable power business. Since the clean energy transition that's taking shape will be a decades-long affair, there's no reason to believe that NextEra Energy's growth runway will come to a sudden halt anytime soon."", 'Enbridge and NextEra Energy will probably appeal to different types of investors. But they share some very important traits. Both have impressive dividend histories, strong and reliable businesses, and historically high yields.

Right now, NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE) looks like it is being mispriced. There are reasons why Wall Street is worried, but the company's management team seems as confident as ever. Given a long history of success for the reliable dividend stock, here are three reasons why you might want to side with management and buy it."", ""About 70% of NextEra Energy's business is roughly similar to its regulated utility competitors. This division owns Florida Power & Light, one of the largest utilities in the United States, among other assets. It is an attractive business, in no small part because Florida has benefited for years from people moving to the Sunshine State for tax and weather reasons. More residents means more customers, and therefore growth."", ""As far as regulated utilities go, the location of NextEra Energy's operations is favorable. That, however, has to be juxtaposed against the need to get rates and investment plans approved by regulators. So despite Florida Power & Light's many advantages, it is still only a slow-and-steady growth segment. That's where NextEra Energy Resources, the remaining 30% of the overall business, comes in. This division is one of the largest producers of solar and wind power in the world."", 'So 70% of the portfolio is a solid ""core"" business and the remaining 30% is a high-growth ""explore"" operation. To put a number on the explore opportunity, NextEra Energy Resources currently has around 36 gigawatts of clean energy generating capacity, which it hopes to expand by as much as 41.8 gigawatts by the end of 2026. Simply put, there\'s plenty of growth ahead here even though investors have soured on the shares, pushing them over 33% below their early-2022 peak.', ""Calculating a dividend yield is a pretty simple math equation, simply taking the annualized dividend and dividing it by the current market price. If the dividend stays constant and the price falls, the yield goes up -- and that's exactly what has happened at NextEra Energy. It is currently yielding around 3.3%, which is near decade highs. That suggests the stock is cheap today."", ""There are two things to discuss here. First, why did NextEra Energy's stock price fall so much? Rising interest rates are the biggest factor and they have impacted the entire utility sector. Basically, higher rates make it more expensive for companies in capital-intensive industries to expand their businesses. That's a legitimate concern and, being one of the fastest-growing companies in the utility sector, NextEra Energy was one of the hardest-hit stocks."", ""Second, the 3.3% dividend yield probably isn't all that attractive on an absolute level. You can easily find higher-yielding utilities. But the combination of yield and dividend growth is what is important to understand, bringing us to reason 3."", ""NextEra Energy has increased its dividend annually for 29 consecutive years. Over the past decade, that average annualized boost was a huge 10.9%. That's shockingly high for a utility, but well supported by NextEra's unique two-pronged business model. As 2023 drew to a close, the company was promising that it would raise the dividend by 10% in 2024. But it didn't give a longer-term forecast on payout increases, leaving some doubt about its ability to keep hiking at that elevated rate. But in early 2024, it updated its outlook, projecting 10% dividend growth, backed by 6% to 8% earnings expansion, through at least 2026."", ""In other words, nothing has changed on the dividend growth front despite the interest rate headwinds. And given that the clean energy transition is likely to be a decadeslong event, there's still plenty of runway for more dividend boosts ahead."", 'To sum NextEra Energy up in just a few words, it is a utility with a solid, growth-oriented business model trading at an attractive price despite having a strong outlook for the future. While investors looking for high yields might want to pass on the stock, just about any other kind of investor should find the story here very attractive.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy wasn’t one of them.

With fewer investment opportunities, it makes sense that Medtronic has been paying out a decent 52% of its earnings to shareholders. Given the business isn't reinvesting in itself, it makes sense to distribute a portion of earnings among shareholders."", ""We can conclude that in regards to Medtronic's returns on capital employed and the trends, there isn't much change to report on.

That's not surprising, because AI could change how many companies do business while making the industry's leaders tons of money. While tech corporations have grabbed most of the attention, plenty of companies in other industries are implementing AI in lucrative ways."", ""Let's consider two examples in the healthcare sector: Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG) and Medtronic (NYSE: MDT). Here is why both are smart stock picks."", 'Intuitive Surgical has a portfolio of medical devices, none more famous than the da Vinci system. This robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) device allows physicians to perform minimally invasive surgeries using tiny instruments they can manipulate accurately. The company has used AI to improve the performance of some of its products. Here are two examples.', ""Intuitive's SureForm stapler, an instrument used for various purposes with compatible da Vinci systems, employs machine learning algorithms to analyze the thickness of the body tissue it is clamping on, a feature that helps improve performance. Last year, Intuitive Surgical launched Case Insights, a companion tool to the da Vinci system that uses hospital data to build AI models to find links between surgical techniques, patient populations, and outcomes."", 'The company expects to make more AI-related breakthroughs to improve its already high-performing da Vinci system, which has helped the company deliver excellent financial results and share-price gains over the past 10 years.', 'The healthcare giant is an innovative monster, having pioneered the development of RAS devices that assist doctors in performing non-invasive surgeries. These procedures offer a range of advantages, from smaller incisions and less bleeding to faster recovery times and shorter hospital stays. Intuitive Surgical still has a long runway for growth -- only about 5% of procedures that could be performed robotically currently are.', ""Given the company's first-mover advantage in the industry, not to mention the high barriers to entry into this market, it will be extremely challenging to knock Intuitive Surgical off its pedestal. While increasingly incorporating AI into its devices should make a meaningful difference over the long run, Intuitive Surgical was an outstanding stock to buy before the recent AI craze, and it remains so."", ""Medtronic is also implementing AI within some of its medical devices. Consider the company's LINQ II, a cardiac monitoring system. Thanks to AI algorithms, Medtronic has been able to fine-tune this device and decrease the number of false alerts while maintaining a high level of true alerts. In another example of Medtronic's use of AI, the company's Touch Surgery is an AI-powered video platform designed to help train physicians better."", ""Medtronic, too, has big ambitions for AI. Beyond that, the company's prospects remain exciting even though it is having trouble growing its revenue at a good clip in recent years."", ""But the healthcare giant is doubling down on innovation. One of Medtronic's most promising areas is RAS. True, its device, the Hugo system, isn't yet cleared in the U.S. But given how underpenetrated this market is, Medtronic rightly sees it as a significant long-term growth opportunity. It is one of the few medical device giants that may have what it takes to challenge Intuitive Surgical in this field."", ""Medtronic is also looking to make headway in diabetes care, another market with massive untapped potential. Medtronic is a leader in providing pumps for diabetes patients. About 500 million adults in the world now have diabetes. A substantial percentage live in developing countries. Medtronic does business in 150 countries, granting it access to this vast market in ways some competitors can't."", ""Finally, Medtronic is an excellent dividend stock. The company has raised its payouts for 46 consecutive years. It could soon be a Dividend King. Medtronic likely isn't a great growth stock, but it can provide risk-averse investors with stability and solid passive income for years."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Intuitive Surgical right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Intuitive Surgical, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intuitive Surgical wasn’t one of them.

Why dividend payers? Well, they can appreciate in value just like other good stocks, but while doing so, they'll kick out cash to you regularly -- cash that can be used to support you in retirement or to buy additional shares of stock. And on top of that, healthy and growing dividend payers typically increase their payouts over time, too."", ""Here's the kicker: Dividend payers tend to perform better than non-payers, too! Check out the table below, adapted from a Hartford Funds report:"", 'Dividend-Paying Status', 'Average Annual Total Return, 1973-2022', 'Dividend growers and initiators', '10.24%', 'Dividend payers', '9.18%', 'No change in dividend policy', '6.60%', 'Dividend non-payers', '(0.60%)', 'Dividend shrinkers and eliminators', '3.95%', 'Data source: Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds.', 'Here, then, are three dividend-paying stocks to consider for your portfolio. All three have recently sporting attractive valuations as well as attractive dividends.', 'Medtronic (NYSE: MDT) is a healthcare giant with a recent market value of $111 billion. It offers medical devices such as implantable pacemakers, aortic valves, mesh implants, stapling devices, and technology used in robot-assisted surgeries -- among many other things. The company employs close to 100,000 people in 150 countries, and its offerings treat more than 70 health conditions, such as diabetes.', ""Medtronic's dividend recently sported a dividend yield of 3.3%, and that payout has increased at an average annual rate of 7% over the past five years (and it has upped its payout for 46 consecutive years now). Its business is growing, too, with third-quarter revenue increasing by 4.7% year over year and earnings per share (EPS) advancing by 8%. Medtronic is likely to keep growing, because it invests heavily in developing new treatments and products. It spent $2.7 billion on research and development in its fiscal year 2023, and recently had more than 200 active clinical trials in progress."", 'Meanwhile, the company is shedding less-profitable operations, such as its line of ventilators. Its stock looks attractively priced at recent levels, with a recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.6, well below its five-year average of 18.1.', ""Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) needs little introduction, as it boasts more than 38,000 locations in more than 80 markets around the globe -- and it also has products on the shelves of many retailers, too. Starbucks' dividend recently yielded 2.5%. That payout has grown by an average annual rate of 10% over the past five years -- and it's likely that another increase will be announced this fall."", ""A solid and growing dividend is great, but you also should want the underlying company to be growing at a decent clip. In its first quarter, Starbucks' net revenue rose 8% to a record $9.4 billion, with sales at stores open more than a year increasing by 5% globally. Earnings per share surged 22%. One particularly successful Starbucks initiative has been its rewards program, with membership growing 13% year over year in the first quarter, to 34.3 million."", ""Everything isn't 100% rosy at the company -- overall inflation has many consumers cutting back on their spending, and Starbucks' growth rate is slower than in years past, in part because of competition. But it has still boosted its operating margin and has multiple irons in the growth fire -- such as offering delivery and drive-thru services. There's a lot to like about Starbucks' prospects -- and its stock seems undervalued, too, with its recent forward P/E of 22.3 well below the five-year average of 28.4."", ""PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) is another familiar name, a $237-billion titan in both the soft-drink and salty-snack realms, with brands such as Lay's, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker, and SodaStream. PepsiCo's dividend recently yielded 2.9%, and it has been upped by an annual average of 6% over the past five years. It, too, has a long dividend history, with its last increase of 7% being its 52nd consecutive annual increase."", ""PepsiCo's net revenue in its fourth quarter was down less than 1% year over year, but its full-year revenue for 2023 was up 5.9%, with full-year EPS rising 2%. Pepsico's stock valuation looks appealing, too, with its forward P/E of 20.0 well below the five-year average of 23.5."", ""These are just three of many attractive dividend payers out there. Remember, too, that if you aren't comfortable picking stocks on your own, you can always opt for one or more dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) -- and you can do so with just $400 or with much more."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Medtronic right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Medtronic, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Medtronic wasn’t one of them.

87,79cecad2-6118-3814-aadc-f267e1f88eef,WMB,2024-04-01,4 Top Dividend Stocks Yielding 4% to Buy in April,Motley Fool,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/79cecad2-6118-3814-aadc-f267e1f88eef/4-top-dividend-stocks.html,1711970100,STORY,"['CVX', 'BIP-PA', '^GSPC', 'CPT', 'WMB']","[""The stock market has gotten off to a roaring start in 2024. The S&P 500 ended the first quarter up 10%, its average return over an entire year. That surge has driven down its dividend yield to 1.3%. It's approaching a historically low level. "", 'However, while the dividend yield on most stocks has fallen as share prices have risen, some enticing opportunities remain available. Here are four top dividend stocks yielding at least 4% that you can buy for income this April.', ""Chevron (NYSE: CVX) entered April with a dividend yield of about 4.1%. The oil and gas giant has an exceptional track record of paying dividends. This year was its 37th consecutive year of increasing its dividend, one of the longest streaks in the oil patch. Chevron gave its investors an 8% raise. Its five-year dividend growth rate is higher than the S&P 500's and more than double the pace of its closest peer. "", ""The oil company should have ample fuel to continue increasing its high-yielding dividend. Its high-return capital program has it on track to grow its free cash flow by more than 10% annually through 2027, assuming oil averages $60 a barrel. That will supply it with enough cash to fund its capital program, pay a growing dividend, and repurchase shares at the low end of its $10 billion-$20 billion annual target range. Meanwhile, it could produce an even bigger gusher of free cash flow if oil remains at its current level in the $80s and it closes its needle-moving acquisition of Hess. For example, closing the Hess deal would give it the fuel to more than double its free cash flow by 2027 at $70 oil. With strong growth at lower oil prices and ample upside catalysts, Chevron's dividend should keep heading higher. "", ""Camden Property Trust (NYSE: CPT) currently yields 4.2%. The real estate investment trust (REIT) has done a solid job increasing its dividend over the years. While it hasn't boosted its payout every year, it has steadily raised it since resetting the dividend level in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The payout has grown by a third since 2018. "", ""The residential REIT is in a strong position to continue growing its dividend. It's benefiting from strong demand for rental housing, which is enabling it to steadily raise rents and expand its portfolio. It currently has five new communities under development, including its first two single-family rental communities. Meanwhile, it has nine more communities under development that it hopes to start construction on in the future. It also has the financial flexibility to make acquisitions as opportunities arise. These growth catalysts should enable Camden to continue increasing its dividend. "", 'Brookfield Infrastructure (NYSE: BIPC)(NYSE: BIP) yields around 4.5% these days. The global infrastructure operator has an excellent record of paying dividends. It has increased its payout every year since it came public a decade and a half ago. It has grown the dividend at a 10% annual rate since 2009, including by 6% earlier this year. ', ""The company aims to grow its payout by 5% to 9% annually in the future. It should have no problem delivering on that target, given its expectations that its funds from operations (FFO) per share will continue growing at a double-digit annual rate. It's benefiting from strong growth drivers as it focuses on capitalizing on three global megatrends: decarbonization, digitalization, and deglobalization. It's investing heavily to capitalize on those opportunities by funding high-return expansion projects like data centers and semiconductor manufacturing plants and making accretive acquisitions. It closed $2 billion in deals last year (a global container leasing company and three data center platforms), giving it a lot of momentum for 2024 and beyond. "", 'Williams (NYSE: WMB) yields around 4.9%. The natural gas pipeline giant has paid dividends to its investors for 50 straight years. It has grown its payout at a 6% compound annual rate since 2018, including by 6.1% earlier this year. ', ""The company has lots of fuel to continue increasing its dividend. It's investing heavily in building additional natural gas infrastructure to support growing demand. Williams' current slate of secured capital projects will provide an uplift to its earnings through at least 2027. They help drive its view that it can grow its earnings by 5% to 7% annually over the long term. Meanwhile, its strong financial profile gives it the flexibility to make acquisitions as attractive opportunities arise. It recently spent $2 billion on a major natural gas storage portfolio. These drivers should give Williams the fuel to continue increasing its dividend. "", 'Surging stock prices have many companies offering rather unappealing dividend yields these days. However, there are some attractive opportunities, with Chevron, Camden Property, Brookfield Infrastructure, and Williams all offering yields above 4%. Furthermore, this quartet has steadily increased their payouts over the years, which seems likely to continue. Those features make them attractive opportunities for income-seeking investors this April.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chevron wasn’t one of them.

They have less incentive to produce natural gas the longer those prices remain low. The result is that large producers are beginning to cut production “strategically”. One of the nation’s largest producers stated that it would reduce production by as much as 8% beginning those cuts in late February.', 'Those cuts will likely result in higher home heating bills for consumers in the near to mid future. However, cuts should also naturally increase the price of natural gas which will benefit investors.

The stock represents a company that owns and operates pipelines and other midstream assets.', 'Many other large energy firms tend to be oil focused but the Williams companies is focused on natural gas making it a purer play in relation to low natural gas prices.', 'The Williams Companies is also one of the better choices in the natural gas sector for those investors seeking stability. The company increased its net income by $478 million in the fourth quarter and $1.2 billion in 2023 overall.', 'The company was already telegraphing strength weeks earlier when it increased its dividend by more than 6%. That dividend smooths volatility overall adding an additional 5% return for investors. In short, the Williams Companies is a stock that natural gas investors can rely on. At the same time, it provides potentially\xa0strong returns and is a solid choice.', 'Source: shutterstock.com/Wojciech Wrzesien', 'Cheniere Energy (NYSE:LNG) is something of a pioneer among natural gas stocks. Back in 2016, Cheniere Energy became the first American company to export liquefied natural gas. A few years later it became a Fortune 500 company.', 'The reason I mentioned the company’s export history is that exports have largely propped up natural gas firms over the last year. With prices low\xa0in the U.S., those firms have had to look abroad for margin opportunities.', 'That put Cheniere Energy in a strong position overall. The result was that the company’s 2023 performance was above the midpoint of guidance. The company also expects that 2024 will be equally strong with expectations of reaching beyond the midpoint of guidance for the year.', 'Company-wide earnings spiked during 2023 allowing the company to repurchase 9.5 million shares of its stock. 2024 has started similarly with the company repurchasing 2.9 million shares of its stock between the New Year and mid-February.', 'Source: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com', 'ONEOK (NYSE:OKE) is one of the bigger names in the natural gas stocks and also one of the more stable for income investors. The company last reduced its dividend in 1999 and it continues to pay roughly 5% at the moment.', 'The company announced a $2 billion dollar share repurchase program in January. ONEOK intends to utilize those repurchases strategically over the next four years. The overall thrust of the last few sentences is that ONEOK is a strong income stock for investors to consider.', 'The company also gave guidance for double digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2024.', 'One of the other primary things to note about ONEOK is that the company is a diversified play in natural gas. The company engages in the broad midstream transportation of natural gas.

The company pays a base dividend that it can maintain when energy prices are lower and a variable dividend that rises as energy prices increase.', 'The result is that investors who catch Devon Energy at the right time end up being rewarded handsomely. The stock isn’t one for income investors who value a predictable income stream from dividends. Instead, Devon Energy is better suited to investors who like to gamble a bit more.', 'It looks like investors have caught on to that notion as Devon Energy shares have increased by more than 9% over the past month.\xa0The company itself has proven to be a wise investor and creates value over the long term as measured by its return on investment.', 'Source: rafapress / Shutterstock.com', 'EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) is arguably the natural gas stock in the best position to influence the market in 2024.

The company is clearly attempting to reduce supply in an effort to increase prices. Given its position as the largest U.S. producer, it may wield the influence to do so. Natural gas stocks have been rising over the past few weeks which suggests that the company is strongly positioned.', 'The other thing to note here is that EQT stock has much greater upside potential than any of the natural gas stocks mentioned above. Analysts believe that it could nearly double in price from a current $33. Income investors should also note that EQT Corporation is more focused on growth. Its dividend yields a relatively low 1.8%.', 'Source: Pavel Ignatov / Shutterstock.com', 'Coterra Energy (NYSE:CTRA) is an exploration and production stock which is important to note in relation to gas prices. The point here is that Coterra Energy explores oil and gas production assets whereas many of the other stocks on this list are primarily natural gas related.', 'Oil first companies like Coterra Energy tend to derive a lot of their natural gas production as a result of oil exploration. It’s essentially a byproduct of oil exploration and thus the company is less sensitive to gas price fluctuations. Instead, Coterra Energy generally gets a bonus from the natural gas extracted alongside the crude oil it produces. That makes it a more diversified energy play that benefits from potential oil price increases as well as byproduct natural gas price increases.', 'Like EQT Corporation, Coterra Energy is primarily a growth play in natural gas. It includes a modest dividend yielding less than 1%.

It is a well-diversified energy company. Another thing that makes Cenovus Energy unique is that it pays dividends and royalties to investors.', 'The company has an upstream and downstream business with royalties coming from upstream production. That means the company pays royalties to asset owners, actually decreasing income in the process. While that may seem like a detriment to investors, the overall outlook on CVE stock is strong.

(NYSE:BLK) have revealed, and the retirement landscape in the US doesn’t seem as promising as it once used to be.', 'According to BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) reports, respondents believe that retirement is not the time to “live it up”. Rather, it is the time to feel “financially secure”. Having conducted this research jointly with the Employee Benefit Research Institute, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) reveals that across all wealth levels on average, most “current” retirees still had 80% of their pre-retirement savings even after almost two decades of being retired. One-third were found having grown their assets instead. Even though these statistics may seem like good news, the reality may paint a stark contrast. The truth is, many retirees may not be spending down their assets due to the uncertain retirement landscape that the country paints. Many may even believe on “hoarding” on these very assets in an attempt to enjoy the same lifestyle they did so before retirement.', 'Coming back to how the United States is increasingly becoming expensive to live in, a recent Consumer Expenditure Survey from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reveals that average monthly expenses for American households have risen to $6,081, amounting to $72,967 annually. This figure represents a notable increase from the $5,557 monthly expenditure recorded in 2022. In particular, expenses for seniors aged 65 and above amount to $57,818 annually. Out of this average annual expenditure, food and housing are the biggest expenses of retirees. Housing takes up an estimated 35% of average annual expenditures, while food accounts for an estimated average annual spending of $7,306. When considering additional expenses like transportation, healthcare, and maintenance, the list of financial obligations can seem never-ending. This is particularly daunting when juxtaposed with the average Social Security amount, which we have discussed early on.', 'These figures also highlight the ongoing struggle presented by high costs of living, which greatly affects the financial situation of residents nationwide, particularly those with fixed incomes.\xa0 Talking specifically about retirees, the median retirement savings for boomers stand at $202,000, as noted by TransAmerica Center for Retirement Studies. Moreover, a recent survey by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) reveals that Americans now believe they need an estimated $1.8 million to retire anyway. Comparing the median savings to this figure, it is safe to say that retirees with minimal savings are in for quite a difficult time in retirement. Their retirement savings may not be sufficient to cover expenses for retirees.', ""Further compounding the challenges of retirement planning is the healthcare landscape of the country. Factors like soaring healthcare costs and disparities in coverage are increasingly provoking retirees to question whether retirement in the USA is still a wise decision. The private healthcare insurance sector, as seen to be dominated by companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), and The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), are seen to report substantial profits, while customers bear the brunt of industry's prioritization of profits over patient well-being."", 'In 2023, internal documents from STAT showed that UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) used some secret rules that helped them restrict access to rehabilitation care that was requested from them by specific groups of patients that were seriously ill. This restriction included those who lived in nursing homes or suffered from cognitive impairment. In another instance, internal records from The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) that were scrutinized by ProPublica and The Capitol Forum revealed that the company had been accruing substantial savings by denying claims based on medical reasons. Allegedly, The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) doctors are neglecting to review patient files, as outlined in the report. Due to factors such as these, corporations like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) and The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) thrive, even as seniors suffer the consequences.', 'Retiring abroad, in contrast, is increasingly painting a compelling picture for retirees. Furthermore, data from sources like the Social Security Administration indicate a significant rise in the number of Americans receiving their benefits from overseas, reflecting the growing trend of retirees exploring international retirement options for reasons that extend beyond finances. For those whose average check is a mere $1,909 a month, or even lower considering this is only the average amount, it pays to know affordable retirement communities outside the country. There are many cheapest countries for retirement that will offer retirees such communities to explore, with many boasting a cost of living that is even lower than $1,000 on average. Living in these places doesn’t only prove cost-effective, but also a breeze considering that many of them are some of the easiest countries to retire to.', 'Stefano Ember/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile the list of cheapest places to retire abroad on $1,000 per month, we sifted through our lists of places to retire on $1,000 a month, cheapest warm places to retire around the world, best places to retire around the world for US Citizens, cheapest places to retire in Europe, best places to retire in the world on Social Security, and awesome places to retire on $3,000 or less, to name a few.

Its recent results, however, say the opposite. Revenue at Nike was flat in its fiscal third quarter at $12.4 billion, and was up just 1% in the first three quarters of the year."", ""Nike is facing a number of challenges that have led to its growth stalling. It's losing market share, especially in running, to upstart competitors like On Holding and Deckers' Hoka brand. It also said it was pulling back its supply of styles like the Air Force 1 and Pegasus running shoes, a sign that it's leaned too hard on classic brands. It also continues to be impacted by parting ways with Kyrie Irving, one of its biggest basketball stars, over a year ago."", ""As a result of those challenges, Nike stock is down 20% over the past year even as the broad market has soared, and it's off nearly 50% from its pandemic-era peak. It's easy to see why Nike stock has fallen as the stock is still priced for growth. However, Nike is now shifting its strategy in order to rebuild business momentum. Here's how."", 'CEO John Donahoe said the company aims to ""build a multiyear cycle of new innovation, sharpen our brand storytelling, and work with our wholesale partners to elevate and grow the marketplace.""', ""The focus on the wholesale channel is new for Nike. In recent years, its strategy has been to shift away from wholesale and build its own direct-to-consumer brands. The company had said earlier that it would de-prioritize retailers who didn't elevate its brand, and aimed to take more control of its customer relationships. It also cut 50% of its wholesale partners, especially small independent stores, effectively cutting them off from Nike products."", 'However, it may have leaned too hard on that strategy as brand digital sales were down 3% in the quarter, and it now seems to have rediscovered the advantage of the wholesale channel.', 'Donahoe said on the earnings call, ""We recognize that our wholesale partners help us scale our innovation and newness in physical stores and connect our brands in the path of the consumer."" It was something of a mea culpa for a company that had stunned the footwear retail industry years ago by pulling its product from thousands of stores. However, it\'s the right move for Nike.', 'On some level, drawing back from the wholesale channel made sense. Direct-to-consumer sales tend to have higher margins, and the growth of the mobile economy set up an opportunity for Nike to build customer relationships through apps like SNKRS, Nike, and Nike Training Club.', 'However, dumping dedicated retail partners now seems like a mistake and is part of the reason why competitors like On and Hoka have been able to gain traction and take market share.', 'Nike forgot that it still holds the cards in these wholesale relationships. Foot Locker, for example, brought in roughly 65% of its revenue from Nike in 2022, and those businesses deliver customers for Nike. They also absorb some of the marketing and overhead costs in selling footwear and have the advantage of thousands of stores.', ""Recently, Nike has resumed its relationship with retailers like Macy's and DSW, which control billions of dollars in spending. Nike forgot that those relationships were a competitive advantage, and shelf space in those stores is an asset."", ""There's an argument for scarcity and exclusivity in some products. For example, Nike has employed that tactic well with its Jordan brand, but overall Nike is a mass-market brand. It makes sense for it to be available where consumers shop for sneakers."", ""It's likely to take time for the wholesale strategy to pay off, and Nike's guidance was part of the reason the stock sold off on the earnings report."", 'Management called for revenue to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter, but sees revenue down low single digits in the first half of fiscal 2025 as it cuts back on classics and other top brands before a return to growth in the second half of the fiscal year.', 'Given that forecast, investors are bettering off waiting for clearer signs of a recovery, but the decision to reinvest in the wholesale channel is the right move for the business, and it should pay off down the road.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nike right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nike, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nike wasn’t one of them.

However, if you dig a little deeper, you see that there is a divergence forming.', ""Here's why the S&P 500 could keep going up despite this challenge, and how these changing market dynamics could impact your portfolio."", 'There are plenty of ways to categorize companies. You could do it by sector. Or growth stocks versus value stocks. Or small cap versus large cap. But one often overlooked difference between companies is whether they mainly sell to consumers or businesses. For example, Nvidia and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are both big tech stocks. But Nvidia predominantly sells to businesses, while Apple is more consumer-facing.', 'Some -- though not all -- consumer-facing companies are struggling, while business-facing companies are hitting record highs. The economy as a whole is doing well, but not as well if you look through the lens of the consumer.', 'The industrial sector has quietly hit an all-time high, led by surging profits from heavy equipment and special machinery manufactures like General Electric and Caterpillar. Meanwhile, a more consumer-facing company, United Parcel Service, which is one of the largest indusial companies by market cap, is hovering around a three-year low. The divergence within the industrial sector is an allegory for the broader market.', 'Many companies rely on consumer discretionary spending and brand power to convince consumers to pay up for their products. Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) is much more expensive than coffee and tea from a grocery store. Nike (NYSE: NKE) and Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ: LULU) charge far more for their shoes and apparel than non-name-brand alternatives.

But cost concerns remain, namely from higher wages and unionization efforts that could hurt its margins. Starbucks is doing well internationally, but a lot of its store growth over the next few years is centered on China, which has been facing a slowdown.', ""Apple and Tesla have been particularly vulnerable to the China slowdown. Apple's growth has slowed in the U.S. and most of its emerging markets, but it's still putting up record results. However, sales have fallen by double-digit percentages in China, which is Apple's second-most-important market outside the U.S. And aside from economic woes, Apple is also facing steep competition from Huawei and others that are aiming to take market share from Apple in China."", ""Tesla has seen its margins collapse in the face of slowing demand and price cuts. It's also facing heated competition in China, its second-largest market, from BYD and other competitors. Meanwhile, legacy automakers like Toyota are having success with hybrid vehicles over pure-play EVs -- challenging Tesla's business model.

The investment thesis for Apple, Tesla, Nike, Lululemon, and Starbucks hasn't really changed. Instead, all five stocks are underperforming because these companies don't have the qualities that are driving the widespread rally (artificial intelligence and rising corporate profits from business-to-business sales)."", 'Investors who think consumers and China will recover over time are getting the chance to buy many great companies on sale.

We have also discussed the saving trends of Americans. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Countries with the Highest Savings Rate in the World.\xa0', ""In the wake of the pandemic, US consumers are diverging from their counterparts in other developed economies by spending their savings rather than increasing them. While Western Europe, Japan, and Canada have seen rises in saving rates, the US stands out with a decline in savings levels post-2022, according to Federal Reserve Bank of New York analysis. The pandemic initially boosted savings worldwide due to business closures and government relief, with the US notably distributing substantial stimulus checks. However, Americans are now swiftly spending these 'excess savings,' a phenomenon that has even puzzled economists."", ""The trend challenges economic norms, as US consumers maintain spending amid inflation and high interest rates, supported by their accumulated savings. Some economists attribute this behavior to the origin of the savings, suggesting that people are more inclined to spend government transfers viewed as 'unearned.' Despite skepticism about the concept of 'excess savings,' it continues to influence economic discussions.\xa0"", ""In Bankrate's 2024 annual emergency savings report, statistics further confirmed the financial challenges faced by Americans. More than one-third (36%) of adults possess more credit card debt than emergency savings, a concerning trend exacerbated by years of soaring inflation. However, there's a glimmer of hope as nearly one in three (30%) individuals report bolstering their emergency savings compared to the previous year, signifying a concerted effort towards financial resilience. Despite this, a concerning reality persists: over half of Americans wouldn't cover a sudden $1,000 expense from their emergency savings, opting instead to borrow money or reduce spending."", 'The upcoming Federal Reserve meeting on May 1 holds important interest rate implications, with expectations suggesting rates will hold steady between 5.25% to 5.5%.

However, forecasts anticipate rate reductions between June and September, contingent upon economic data shifts.', ""Moreover, the Fed's March meeting revealed a consensus among policymakers for potential rate cuts in 2024, citing favorable disinflation trends but acknowledging the need for cautious adjustment to avoid either inflation resurgence or harm to employment. The timing of these cuts hinges on incoming economic indicators, with employment stability providing the Fed room to gauge inflation trends before implementing rate adjustments."", ""Inflation metrics, particularly the Personal Consumption Expenditures inflation rate, play a pivotal role in shaping future rate decisions. The Fed awaits updates on inflation data, expecting a degree of cooling in housing services inflation rates while monitoring potential reversals in certain deflationary trends, such as declining prices for household goods and used cars. As the Fed navigates these economic nuances, market observers anticipate a measured approach to interest rate adjustments, with May's meeting likely to provide further clarity on the trajectory of future rate cuts."", 'Before getting into our list of countries with the highest saving rates in the world, let’s look at the best banks for savers.\xa0', 'Citibank Group Inc (NYSE:C) is an excellent option for savers with its diverse range of savings account packages, each offering competitive Annual Percentage Yields (APYs).

However, despite these competitive rates within the traditional banking sector, online banks often provide even more attractive rates, regardless of account balance.', 'On the other hand, Wells Fargo & Co (NYSE:WFC)’s Way2Save Savings Account offers a flat 0.01% APY, irrespective of the account balance. While this account provides perks like low minimum opening deposits and opportunities to waive monthly service fees, its interest rate remains notably low compared to online banking alternatives.

They each sold a leading coronavirus vaccine -- and Pfizer sold a COVID treatment too -- and these products generated billions of dollars in earnings for the companies.', ""Pfizer and Moderna still sell these top products, but demand for them has declined as we head toward a post-pandemic world. That's weighed on earnings, pushed the companies to cut costs to match infrastructure to demand, and hurt share price performance in recent times. Pfizer and Moderna shares each have lost about 30% over the past year."", ""But the tide may be about to turn for these struggling stocks, thanks to each company's focus on long-term growth. That makes them both compelling buys today. But if you could only get in on one of these recovery stories right now, which one should you go for? Let's find out."", ""Pfizer's coronavirus products helped it reach a record of more than $100 billion in sales back in 2022, so it's no surprise investors were disappointed when sales came in at about $58 billion last year. And Pfizer faces a second problem -- some of its blockbusters outside of the coronavirus program are set to lose exclusivity later this decade, representing lost sales of about $17 billion."", ""But Pfizer's made big moves to turn things around and spur future growth. The company is completing its biggest wave of product launches ever, with 19 in just 18 months. And the healthcare giant also made a string of acquisitions that should help add billions of dollars to revenue too. One that looks particularly promising is the purchase of oncology specialist Seagen. That came with four commercialized products with sales on the rise -- and a solid pipeline that could significantly boost Pfizer's position in cancer treatment."", ""Pfizer expects its new product launches to result in $20 billion in revenue by 2030, and its business development deals could add another $25 billion to revenue by that time. This, plus additional growth from pipeline programs may lead to revenue of as much as $84 billion in 2030. And this doesn't include coronavirus-related products. This represents 65% growth from pre-coronavirus days and shows that Pfizer may be down today, but it's definitely not out."", ""Like Pfizer, Moderna saw its coronavirus vaccine revenue drop drastically -- in this case from a peak of $18 billion in 2022 to $6.7 billion last year. What's made the situation even worse is the vaccine is Moderna's only product, and that's prompted investors to worry about the company's future growth."", ""But here's why there's more reason to be optimistic than pessimistic. Moderna has a solid pipeline, with many late-stage candidates that could help the company reach its goal of launching 15 new products over the coming five years. Even if Moderna only makes it part of the way, we still could be looking at a significant and diversified source of revenue moving forward."", ""The closest-to-market candidate is Moderna's respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine, one that regulators should decide on in the first half of this year. Strong trial data make me pretty confident about an approval, and the fact that it would be the only RSV vaccine to come in a pre-filled syringe could help it easily gain market share."", 'If Moderna meets its product commercialization goals later this decade, it expects to bring in as much as $30 billion in revenue a few years after the launches of all of these products. This includes a variety of new products, from respiratory vaccines to a personalized cancer treatment.', ""So, like Pfizer, Moderna may be heading for a whole new era of growth -- and this time, it won't depend on just one product."", ""The better buy depends on your investment style. If you like dividends and the safety of a big pharma player that already has a broad portfolio of commercialized drugs, now is a great time to get in on Pfizer. It's trading for only 12x forward earnings estimates, but valuation could move higher once the company's renewed portfolio starts to generate revenue growth."", ""If you're looking for stronger share performance potential though, you should opt for Moderna. Yes, the company has been in the doldrums for quite some time, but when things go right, biotech stocks tend to soar. That's because these players often are more growth oriented than big pharma companies."", 'And if all goes smoothly in late-stage clinical trials and through the regulatory process, Moderna is on target to deliver.

Breakthroughs in semaglutide and tirzepatide have given rise to several glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) medications, including Ozempic, Rybelsus, Wegovy, Mounjaro, and Zepbound.', 'While that is a long list of treatments, only two companies are the brains behind these blockbuster drugs: Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.', 'Recently, a smaller company called Viking Therapeutics made waves in the weight loss scene following a successful phase 2 trial for its obesity candidate VK273.', ""Given Viking is still in development stages, some investors are speculating that the company could be an acquisition target. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) has been listed as a potential suitor, given the company's struggles to enter the weight loss market."", ""Could Pfizer be on the verge of another breakthrough? Let's assess the possibilities."", 'Right now, Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly dominate the weight loss market. However, J.P. Morgan suggests the GLP-1 market could eclipse $100 billion by 2030. Moreover, data compiled by the International Diabetes Federation shows that by 2045 there could be 1 billion adult diabetics worldwide.', ""Not only are diabetes and obesity care enormous markets, but the underlying growth forecasts suggest the opportunity could be lucrative over the long run. Furthermore, given the size of the addressable market, it's likely that Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk will eventually face more competition."", 'While Viking is not yet approved to commercialize VK273, the company could be the most realistic threat to Lilly and Novo so far.', ""The last several years have been interesting for Pfizer. The company played a monumental role in developing a vaccine to combat COVID-19. Unsurprisingly, demand for Pfizer's COVID-19 products soared -- leading to record sales for the pharma giant."", 'However, as pandemic concerns subside, Pfizer has been hard-pressed to reignite growth. The company has tried to enter the red-hot weight loss space, but has ultimately failed to make any inroads.', ""There are two main reasons why I don't think Pfizer will buy Viking."", 'First, the company just closed its acquisition of oncology specialist Seagen in December. As a reminder, this was not a small-scale deal. Pfizer paid a whopping $43 billion for Seagen.', 'Given the size of this transaction, I surmise Pfizer is looking at complicated and long integration efforts. As such, pursuing any further acquisitions could distract from current priorities.', 'On top of all of that, Pfizer issued $31 billion of debt in order to finance the Seagen deal. In total, Pfizer now holds over $70 billion of debt on its balance sheet.', ""It's not atypical for pharmaceutical companies to carry a lot of debt on the balance sheet. After all, bringing new medications to the market is a timely effort that requires significant costs related to research and development."", ""However, given what's at stake with Seagen, I would think Pfizer isn't looking to take on any more loans to finance further transactions. Moreover, any excess cash flow the company generates will likely be used to retire current debt or maintain the dividend -- as opposed to reinvesting in strategic opportunities such as acquisitions."", ""Will Pfizer acquire Viking? Maybe, but I see it as highly unlikely right now. The company has a lot going on from an operational standpoint and the priority should be to legitimize the Seagen deal above all else. Moreover, while Viking appears to have some momentum, there is no guarantee that the company's obesity drug will reach commercialization."", ""I think a more prudent approach is to monitor Viking's progress through clinical trials. Should the company be approved for its obesity drug, Pfizer may want to consider an acquisition at that point. Of course, this would be more expensive, but it would also come with less speculation."", 'Overall, I think Pfizer is best off tabling its pursuit of the weight loss market, remaining focused on its core offerings, and bolstering its oncology services.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Pfizer wasn’t one of them.

The ex-dividend date is usually set to be one business day before the record date which is the cut-off date on which you must be present on the company's books as a shareholder in order to receive the dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Thus, you can purchase McCormick's shares before the 5th of April in order to receive the dividend, which the company will pay on the 22nd of April."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.42 per share, and in the last 12 months, the company paid a total of US$1.68 per share. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, McCormick has a trailing yield of approximately 2.2% on its current stock price of US$76.81. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! As a result, readers should always check whether McCormick has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' Check out our latest analysis for McCormick ', 'Dividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. McCormick paid out more than half (60%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flows are even more important than profits for assessing a dividend, so we need to see if the company generated enough cash to pay its distribution. Fortunately, it paid out only 42% of its free cash flow in the past year.', ""It's positive to see that McCormick's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""When earnings decline, dividend companies become much harder to analyse and own safely. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. Readers will understand then, why we're concerned to see McCormick's earnings per share have dropped 5.6% a year over the past five years. When earnings per share fall, the maximum amount of dividends that can be paid also falls."", ""Many investors will assess a company's dividend performance by evaluating how much the dividend payments have changed over time. Since the start of our data, 10 years ago, McCormick has lifted its dividend by approximately 9.5% a year on average. That's interesting, but the combination of a growing dividend despite declining earnings can typically only be achieved by paying out more of the company's profits. This can be valuable for shareholders, but it can't go on forever."", ""Has McCormick got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? The payout ratios are within a reasonable range, implying the dividend may be sustainable. Declining earnings are a serious concern, however, and could pose a threat to the dividend in future. To summarise, McCormick looks okay on this analysis, although it doesn't appear a stand-out opportunity."", ""However if you're still interested in McCormick as a potential investment, you should definitely consider some of the risks involved with McCormick. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for McCormick that we recommend you consider before investing in the business."", ""If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Typically blue-chip stocks are issued by large, mature and financially strong companies. Benefits of owning blue-chip stocks include stable finances, strong earnings growth, profitability and consistent dividend payments. Blue-chip stocks are typically issued by companies dominating their sector or industry, not easily disrupted by competitors or market forces. Analysts often describe blue-chip stocks as being “defensive” in nature because their share price tends to fall less during market turmoil and recover faster when the bulls are running on Wall Street.', 'Given all of their benefits, it’s advisable for investors to hold a decent number of blue-chip securities in their portfolio. While blue-chip stocks have a reputation for growing at a slower pace than newer and flashier growth stocks, this isn’t always the case. Some very old and established blue-chip stocks continue to outperform the market even today.

In February, Target launched a new low-priced private label brand called “Dealworthy,” with products such as socks, laundry detergent and other items available for less than $10.', 'The rewards program and cheaper items should help to drive Target’s earnings and share price higher in coming quarters.

Creating a similarly prominent group in another sector like healthcare isn\'t an exact science. So, some might not agree with the list below. That said, though, all seven healthcare stocks in my ""Magnificent Seven"" of the industry share the following characteristics. First, they are all leaders in their respective niches.', 'Second, they have soundly outperformed the market over the past decade. Third, they all have solid long-term prospects. With that said, here is my Magnificent Seven of healthcare stocks: Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX), AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG), HCA Healthcare (NYSE: HCA), and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH).', ""It makes sense to group these two pharmaceutical giants. Both are leaders in the diabetes and obesity care markets, where they have been competing for decades. Eli Lilly earned approval last year for Zepbound, an anti-obesity treatment that should go on to generate billions in revenue. Novo Nordisk's competitor in this area, Wegovy, is still growing its sales at an incredible pace. Further, both drugmakers have incredibly deep pipelines."", ""Novo Nordisk is still looking to innovate in the obesity market. It recently reported positive results from a phase 1 study for a promising candidate. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly earned approval for several new products last year. It is awaiting word from U.S. regulators for donanemab, a potential Alzheimer's disease therapy. Eli Lilly also delivered promising phase 1 results for a gene therapy that could treat hearing loss."", 'Both companies should continue delivering excellent financial results and stock market performances. Expect both to be trillion-dollar stocks within a decade.', ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals has been riding the wave of its dominance in the market for therapies that treat a rare disease called cystic fibrosis (CF). Though highly innovative in this area, in which it continues to make headway, the biotech is now looking for diversification. Reducing its exposure to its core therapeutic area isn't a bad idea. Vertex Pharmaceuticals recently earned approval for a gene-editing treatment called Casgevy."", 'It developed this therapy in collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics. Casgevy is a one-time curative therapy for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, two rare blood diseases that have been incredibly difficult to treat or manage. This milestone was a significant breakthrough for Vertex, but more are coming. The drugmaker is inching closer to launching yet another CF medicine and a brand-new therapy for acute pain.', 'Vertex has several key products in its pipeline as well. The biotech looks set to maintain its momentum for a long time.', 'AbbVie became a stand-alone company in January 2013 when it split from Abbott Laboratories. Since then, the drugmaker has been a market-beater, largely thanks to its superstar immunology drug, Humira. The rheumatoid arthritis medicine ran out of patent exclusivity last year, but AbbVie is managing what is one of the most important patent cliffs in the history of the industry (Humira is the best-selling drug ever) pretty well.', ""Though sales have been declining since last year, management expects that to change by 2025. AbbVie's Skyrizi and Rinvoq are Humira's heirs. Finding a duo of medicines that can replace $21.2 billion in annual peak sales is difficult, but Skyrizi and Rinvoq will exceed that total. Management expects them to rack up combined sales of $27 billion by 2027."", ""That speaks volumes about AbbVie's innovative potential, especially in immunology. The company has other promising products and pipeline candidates, and it is a Dividend King. Investors, including income-seekers, can't go wrong with this stock."", ""Intuitive Surgical is the company behind the da Vinci system, a robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) device. The healthcare leader has pioneered the use of RAS machines, which allow surgeons to perform minimally invasive surgeries. Unlike with open surgeries, doctors don't need to make large incisions to access and get a full view of the organs they are operating on. The da Vinci system is equipped with tiny instruments that boast incredible maneuverability."", ""Intuitive Surgical had 8,606 of its da Vinci systems installed as of the end of 2023. As long as demand for these machines grows and the volume of procedures performed with them increases, Intuitive Surgical's revenue and earnings should continue to move in the right direction. Given the aging population and the fact that only 5% of surgeries that could be performed robotically currently are, it looks like Intuitive Surgical has a long runway for growth."", 'UnitedHealth Group and HCA Healthcare are two important players in the U.S. healthcare system. The former is one of the largest health insurers in the country and offers pharmacy management solutions and data and analytics services to other insurers through its subsidiary Optum. HCA Healthcare is one of the largest hospital chains in the country, with facilities that span much of the U.S., although it is particularly concentrated in Florida and Texas. Though both companies saw their businesses disrupted during the worst of the pandemic and suffered somewhat due to economic issues that followed, their operations are resilient.', ""Pandemic-related troubles have mostly subsided. UnitedHealth Group and HCA Healthcare continue to march forward, and both should also benefit from the aging population. UnitedHealth Group's Optum will see a rise in demand for the services it offers as insurance claims rise, while HCA Healthcare's occupancy rates and volume of medical care services will also move in the right direction. In short, both stocks have plenty of growth fuel left in their tanks."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Eli Lilly wasn’t one of them.

The National Retail Federation recently said in a report that it estimates retail sales to increase in the range of 2.5% and 3.5% in 2024, compared to retail sales growth of 3.6% recorded last year.', 'Jack Kleinhenz, the chief economist at the NRF, said that consumers have shown “much great resilience than expected” and “it’s hard” to be bearish on the consumer. Most of this strength comes from household savings accumulated during the pandemic days.', 'But Kleinhenz wondered whether this consumer resilience will continue in the future since inflation begins to bite and savings diminish.', 'When the pandemic hit, US consumers began spending money on goods instead of experiences and services amid lockdowns. But immediately after the lifting of pandemic-related restrictions, Americans began spending a fortune on experiences. However, Bank of America in its “Consumer Checkpoint” report published in January said that its Winter Spending Survey showed that consumers were planning to decrease spending on dining out, takeout, social events and experiences', 'Bank of America said it surveyed about 2,000 consumers in the US and found that a whopping 59% of the consumers were planning to start 2024 with caution, with intentions to save money and cut back on spending.', 'So far this year, retail and consumer stocks remain strong. VanEck Retail ETF (NASDAQ:RTH) is up about 12.2% in the first quarter of 2024, compared to a 10.2% gain for the S&P 500. Investors would be watching Q1’2024 earnings of retailers closely to see how the US consumer is reacting to the changes in inflation and wage growth. Some analysts are also hopeful that rate cuts would bode well for retail stocks.', 'Back in December, a Wall Street Journal report cited Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets, who said at the time that consumer has been “resilient throughout it all.” Woods said that the overall sentiment was that it’s “OK, we aren’t going to be in a recession. Things are getting little bit better.”', 'Canaccord’s Tony Dwyer recently talked with CNBC and said that the Federal Reserve would need to get “aggressive” when it comes to rate cuts and should not keep interest rates higher for longer to avoid massive layoffs and recession.

Customers include professional flooring installers (40% of sales) and homeowners (60%) primarily doing residential repair and remodel projects. FND directly sources its products from over 240 vendors in over 24 countries, enabling it to eliminate middlemen such as agent/ brokers, importers, and distributors. We believe this direct sourcing model gives the company a cost advantage over its competitors and allows it to offer customers the lowest prices in the industry. FND is also able to offer the largest selection of in-stock flooring in the industry because its stores are significantly larger than its competitors. This differentiated value proposition has enabled FND to consistently take market share from both home improvement centers (~30% of the market) and independent specialty retailers (~60% of the market).', 'The management team, led by Tom Taylor, CEO, has a strong track record of successfully opening more than 170 new stores over the last decade, with plans to eventually reach 500.

In our view, PDD’s competitive moat lies in its team purchase model that facilitates bulk buying through direct partnerships with manufacturers, thereby eliminating intermediaries (e.g., distributors and middlemen) and lowering costs. Key factors driving the company’s meteoric growth include rising consumer demand for affordable products in China amid an economic slowdown, small-scale merchants seeking alternatives to Alibaba, and superior management execution. PDD’s revenue growth outpaces gross merchandize value growth owing to rising take rates as merchants aggressively compete for consumer traffic on the platform. In our view, PDD should continue to gain market share given its dominance in the value-for-money segment, growing affordable branded product offerings, and high operational efficiency. We believe the company’s growth will be further supported by the recent launch of its international e-commerce platform, Temu, which has become one of the fastest growing apps globally. Leveraging China’s excess manufacturing capacity, Temu has strong negotiating power with domestic suppliers and attracts global consumers with competitively priced products. Temu’s recent initiatives to improve unit economics, coupled with achieving variable breakeven in the sizable U.S. market, showcase management’s skill and commitment to sustained growth.

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?"", 'Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of February 2024 Analog Devices had US$7.03b of debt, an increase on US$6.55b, over one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$1.30b, its net debt is less, at about US$5.72b.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Analog Devices had liabilities of US$2.92b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$9.92b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$1.30b and US$1.20b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$10.3b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', 'Of course, Analog Devices has a titanic market capitalization of US$98.1b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. But there are sufficient liabilities that we would certainly recommend shareholders continue to monitor the balance sheet, going forward.', ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio)."", ""Analog Devices's net debt is only 1.0 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 14.3 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. But the bad news is that Analog Devices has seen its EBIT plunge 19% in the last twelve months. If that rate of decline in earnings continues, the company could find itself in a tight spot. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Analog Devices can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", 'Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the last three years, Analog Devices actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.', ""Analog Devices's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But the stark truth is that we are concerned by its EBIT growth rate. All these things considered, it appears that Analog Devices can comfortably handle its current debt levels. Of course, while this leverage can enhance returns on equity, it does bring more risk, so it's worth keeping an eye on this one. We'd be motivated to research the stock further if we found out that Analog Devices insiders have bought shares recently. If you would too, then you're in luck, since today we're sharing our list of reported insider transactions for free."", ""At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

Whereas Visa's total transactions grew by 10% year over year in the last quarter, cross-border transactions grew by 20%. International payments volume has consistently been roughly double that of the U.S. segment."", ""Visa operates a huge, global business with strong network effects and a formidable economic moat.

With that month comes the standard April 15 filing deadline for U.S. income taxes. As of March 15 -- one month before the deadline -- the average taxpayer getting a refund will see a decent $3,109 payment headed their way. Although in most cases, a refund simply represents a repayment of previously overpaid taxes, it still feels nice to get that cash back.', 'Of course, one of the only things better than getting a windfall of cash is successfully investing that cash in ways to potentially provide solid long-term returns. With that in mind, three Motley Fool contributors went looking for companies worthy of consideration as a place to invest that refund check. They picked Realty Income (NYSE: O), Visa (NYSE: V), and Enbridge (NYSE: ENB). Read on to find out why and decide for yourself whether one or more of them may be worth investing your tax refund in.', ""Jason Hall (Realty Income): Getting a tax return is nice, but just remember, you're essentially giving the government an interest-free loan. A better idea is to take that return and buy shares of a high-quality, high-yield investment in one of the best real estate businesses you can own: Realty Income."", 'Realty Income owns and invests in stand-alone commercial real estate such as restaurants, gyms, pharmacies, discount warehouse stores, and other e-commerce-resistant experiential businesses. Its customers are responsible for maintenance and taxes, while Realty Income takes on the capital expense of the land and building.', ""This strategy has worked incredibly well for many years. Realty Income has increased its dividend, not just every year, but every quarter since 1994, while paying shareholders every single month. With a dividend yield near 5.75% at recent prices and a long record of payout growth, now's a great time to turn your tax return into a regular source of income."", 'Eric Volkman (Visa): This week, shares of credit card companies took some hits because of a legal settlement. Visa and its longtime rival Mastercard agreed to shave a few basis points off their interchange, or ""swipe"" fees. These are the charges they impose on merchants using their networks to process payments, and are shared between the credit card giants and the issuers of their plastic (chiefly banks).', ""Investors sold out of the two stocks. To a degree that's understandable; after all, when a company reduces its fees, its revenue tends to sag. But let's pick this one apart a little."", 'The pack of swipe fees tends to hover around 2.3% of the purchase amount, according to data from The Nilson Report cited by The New York Times. In the settlement, Visa and Mastercard agreed to cut all fees by a light 0.04 percentage points for three years and hold the average rate at least 0.07 percentage points below the current level across five years.', ""The settlement -- an important development in a long-simmering lawsuit -- requires approval from a federal judge in New York City. It's also sure to be subject to numerous appeals and objections from merchants who don't feel it goes far enough."", ""So right off the bat, this isn't going to affect Visa immediately. Even if and when it does, those relatively modest cuts aren't going to greatly reduce the torrent of revenue the company earns. Paying with plastic is normal and habitual in the modern world. Even locales where cash transactions still have a grip are enthusiastically adopting more convenient means of commerce."", 'It\'s telling that so far, few analysts have made downward revisions to their estimates for Visa. In fact, they still expect this big ""War on Cash"" winner to continue posting hot growth. On average, they\'re expecting per-share net income to increase by 12% this year and by 13% in 2025. Revenue should see a sharper rise, advancing by 20% in this frame before settling down to 10% next year.', ""Chuck Saletta (Enbridge): Earlier this month, Canadian energy infrastructure titan Enbridge completed its acquisition of the East Ohio Gas Company from Dominion Energy. This is another purchase of a natural gas utility by Enbridge, cementing its position as North America's largest natural gas utility company."", 'While natural gas may not be the most politically popular energy source at the moment, it is expected to remain a strong part of the North American energy mix for decades to come. By buying up so much last-mile delivery and utility infrastructure, Enbridge is making it clear that it believes that natural gas truly has a long-term future in North America.', ""Enbridge's expansion also provides a decent reason to believe that it will be able to continue boosting its dividend over time. Including its 2024 increase, Enbridge can boast 29 consecutive years of dividend raises, at least in terms of the company's home currency, Canadian dollars. (U.S. investors will likely see fluctuations based on exchange rate changes.)"", ""Today's Enbridge investors get a yield of around 7.5%, which is pretty high for a company with such a strong history of regular increases. That dividend consumes just over half of the company's operating cash flow, providing a great reason to believe that its trend can continue, especially as the business keeps investing in its expansion. Do note that U.S. investors will face a Canadian withholding tax on that dividend, unless they hold Enbridge's shares in a qualified retirement account."", 'Put it all together, and Enbridge looks like it offers investors a great combination of current income and potential income growth over time. That makes it worthy of consideration for folks looking for a place to invest their tax refund windfall.', ""Of course, a refund check only adds long-term value if you're able to invest it before the temptation to spend it gets too strong. So make a commitment to yourself to put your tax refund to good use, and consider whether one or more of these three businesses may be worth a bit of your newfound capital."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

That's a good thing for their businesses in some ways, and a bad thing in others. But the good largely outweighs the bad, which helps explain Mastercard's 500%-plus share-price gain over the past decade. Nevertheless, the buy, sell, or hold decision on Mastercard stock isn't exactly an easy one."", ""To start with the positives, Mastercard's industry position is strong. While Visa is actually a bigger company, that doesn't change the fact that Mastercard is a giant that would be hard for a smaller competitor to displace or replace. As card-based payments grow, so, too, does Mastercard's business. There's no particular reason to believe that the upward trend in the payment processing industry is going to come to a sudden halt."", 'If you are a growth-minded investor, that is a compelling storyline and one you might want to jump on. In addition to that, Mastercard has raised its dividend annually for 12 years. The annualized dividend growth rate over the past decade was a heady 23%. More recent boosts have come in at around half that level, but even that is still a huge expansion rate. So if you are a growth-and-income or dividend growth investor, you might find this stock appealing, too. But hold on a second before you run out to buy it...', ""Here's where things get a little more interesting. Mastercard's price-to-sales ratio is around 18.2 today versus a five-year average of 18.1 or so. Its price-to-earnings ratio is 40.9 versus a longer-term average of 40.7. The company's price-to-cash-flow ratio is 32.9 compared to 32.8. And the price-to-book-value ratio is 65 versus the longer-term average of 55 or so."", 'In fairness, the only metric that is significantly out of line with the five-year average is the price-to-book-value ratio. But all of the other traditional valuation measures are clearly indicating that the stock is, at the very least, fully valued.', ""The dividend yield is around 0.5%, which isn't terribly compelling. And that is middle of the road-ish, historically speaking. So the stock looks fully valued and that might lead some investors to hit the pause button on buying it. But while Mastercard's valuation isn't especially attractive, it is perhaps not bad enough to those who own it to sell out of the stock. Thus, sitting pat might make the most sense if you own it."", ""If you are a value investor or an investor trying to maximize the income your portfolio generates, you'll probably want to stay away from Mastercard today. If you have owned it for a number of years and benefited from the massive share-price advance, it wouldn't be unrealistic to consider locking in some of the gains (even if you don't close out the entire position)."", ""But there's another not-so-minor factor to consider here. Mastercard and Visa frequently find themselves battling with customers and regulators thanks to their dominance in the payment processing space. It is hard to track such disputes and they can result in large fines and potentially material changes in the business environment. For more conservative investors, such risks, which the company really can't discuss in any detail while they are ongoing, might be enough of a reason to avoid Mastercard (and Visa, for that matter). It might also be enough to convince an investor with a big gain to take a profit and move on to a less exciting -- and perhaps more attractively valued -- stock."", ""Mastercard is not a screaming buy, but also isn't an obvious sell. Sure, there are some investors who will hate it, like dividend investors, but there are also some that might appreciate it, like growth-and-income types. All told, if you own Mastercard, it probably makes sense to keep it. If you don't own it, you would probably do well to put it on your wish list."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Mastercard right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Mastercard wasn’t one of them.

That's certainly the case when it comes to generating passive income. Most sources require an upfront investment to get the income train chugging along. However, once the income starts flowing, it can be meaningful."", ""Investing in dividend stocks is one of the quickest, and easiest, ways to start collecting passive income.

On top of that, this particular trio has a knack for increasing their dividends, suggesting investors should be able to collect a steadily rising income stream in the coming years. "", ""Another great thing about dividend stocks is you don't need a lot of money to get started generating income. It only costs between $40 and $80 to buy a share of Oneok, Verizon, and W.P. Carey. That enables you to start small and slowly build your passive income portfolio."", ""Here's a look at why these dividend stocks are great income building blocks to consider buying this April."", ""Oneok has been a model dividend payer. The pipeline stock has delivered more than a quarter century of dividend stability and growth. While it hasn't increased its payout every year, the dividend has steadily marched higher. Over the past decade, Oneok has delivered a more than 150% increase in its payout. "", 'The pipeline company expects to continue growing its payout in the future. Its target is to deliver 3% to 4% annual growth. Several factors fuel that view. ', ""Oneok is coming off a transformational year. It closed its $18.8 billion acquisition of Magellan Midstream Partners last year, which diversified its operations while setting the stage for future free cash flow growth. On top of that, it's investing in several high-return organic expansion projects. It recently approved a $355 million expansion of its Elk Creek Pipeline that should enter service by the first quarter of next year. Meanwhile, it's progressing toward approving its Saguaro Connector Pipeline, aiming to start construction later this year. Combine these growth catalysts with its strong financial profile, and Oneok should have the fuel to deliver steady dividend growth in the coming years. "", 'Verizon also has an excellent track record of increasing its dividend. The telecom giant delivered its 17th straight year of dividend growth in 2023, the longest current streak in the U.S. telecom sector. While Verizon is growing its payout at a modest pace of about 2% annually in recent years, it should continue its slow and steady trudge higher. ', 'The mobile and broadband company generates lots of cash to fund its expansion, pay dividends, and strengthen its balance sheet. It produced $37.5 billion of cash flow from operations last year, funding its capital investments ($18.8 billion) and dividend ($11 billion), with $7.7 billion to spare. That excess free cash flow enabled Verizon to strengthen its already solid financial profile. ', ""Verizon's cash flow should rise in the future as its capital investments to build out its faster 5G network start paying off. Meanwhile, costs are coming down as it moderates capital spending ($17 billion to $17.5 billion in 2024) and cuts operating costs ($2 billion to $3 billion by 2025). These initiatives should boost its free cash flow, giving it more money to pay dividends and bolster its balance sheet. "", 'W.P. Carey is coming off a quarter century of annual dividend increases. Unfortunately, that streak ended late last year after the real estate investment trust (REIT) cut its payout by about 20%. It made that move following the sale and spinoff of its office properties. The company reset its payout to reflect its lower earnings and to increase the cash flow it retains to help fund new investments. ', 'However, W.P. Carey has already gotten back on the dividend growth bandwagon this year. It expects to deliver a rising dividend in the future as it increases its rental income. The REIT is in the process of recycling the proceeds from its office sales, and other recent sales, into new investments in healthier sectors, such as industrial, that should grow its rental income. ', 'The company believes its repositioned portfolio and stronger financial profile will put its dividend on an even stronger long-term foundation. Its focus on faster-growing sectors should enable it to grow its rental income (and dividend) at higher rates in the future.', 'Oneok, Verizon, and W.P. Carey offer higher dividend yields, enabling you to generate more income per dollar invested. In addition, those payouts should steadily rise in the future.

Here's what you need to know and why this iconic industrial company is a great place to invest $1,000 today."", 'In 2021, coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic, Stanley Black & Decker reported full-year adjusted earnings of $10.48 per share.

As management looks at the progress it has made on its turnaround plan, it believes that 2024 will end with adjusted earnings coming in between $3.50 and $4.50 per share. At the low end, that would be a 140% improvement, and at the high end, a 210% jump. If the company is close to the target on its projections, 2024 will be a big rebound year for earnings."", 'Given the multiyear downtrend, however, it is completely reasonable that Wall Street is in a ""show me"" mood when it comes to Stanley Black & Decker.

Notably, despite the recent troubles, the board has continued to boost the dividend each year. That speaks to both the long-term focus of the company and its belief that the current issues are temporary. Yes, the last two increases have been just $0.01 per share per quarter. That's little more than a token hike. But that's exactly what you would expect given the business's headwinds. The key is that the board hasn't faltered in its commitment to maintaining its Dividend King status."", ""If Stanley Black & Decker can get earnings heading higher again, Wall Street will likely start looking at the stock more favorably. The fact that adjusted gross margin has been trending steadily upward, meanwhile, hints that the expectation of an earnings upturn is well supported. This industrial stock has been a work in progress and hard to love, but it appears that the inflection point has been reached and that an earnings rebound is about to show up in a potentially big way.

In 2021, When Musk first announced plans to produce a 170cm-tall droid designed to do “boring, repetitious and dangerous” work, he did not even have a prototype. Instead, he brought out an actor in a bodysuit and helmet, who danced for a few seconds before shuffling off the stage.', 'It was a neat illustration of the gap between the promise and the reality of robots.', 'Humanoids – bipedal machines that mimic the human body – have been a science fiction staple since the genre’s creation, and an engineering ambition since Renaissance Italy (Leonardo da Vinci’s notebooks contain several drawings of mechanical knights).', 'In the 1980s and 1990s, the Japanese company Honda ploughed hundreds of millions into ASIMO, a humanoid that largely became known for viral videos of it failing to master stairs.', 'However, the robots we have today are typically single-purpose machines, such as the arms on robot production lines or the spinning platforms in Amazon warehouses that resemble large Roombas.', 'Humanoid robots that can sense their environments, walk on two legs and grasp objects in their hands – requirements that could see them replace humans in manual jobs – would be a potential game changer but progress has remained elusive.', 'Robots have repeatedly struggled to master tasks that seem elementary to humans. Take walking – humans learn to totter around on two legs with moderate success at around 12 months, but the task has turned out to be a fiendishly difficult science problem for robots.', 'Darpa, the US military’s big-spending research lab, ran a robotics challenge in 2015 in response to the Fukushima nuclear disaster, with the aim of producing a robot that could handle the sort of dangerous environments that humans would wish to avoid.', 'The challenge pitted robots against a rudimentary obstacle course of door handles and stairs; the majority failed spectacularly, unable to stay on their feet.', 'The recent boom in artificial intelligence, however, has revived hopes that we will soon live in a world full of droids that will clean our houses, carry out dangerous tasks – and potentially take our jobs. Developments in artificial intelligence systems such as ChatGPT are translating into robots that better understand the world.', 'In 2022, a year after Musk had announced his robot plans with a man in a suit, he unveiled a real robot, one that could walk, wave, and carry boxes. Musk has said the robot, called Optimus, would cost around $20,000 (£15,800) and said Tesla planned to start using it in its own factories before a public release.', 'There’s a new bot in town 🤖Check this out (until the very end)!https://t.co/duFdhwNe3K pic.twitter.com/8pbhwW0WNc', '— Tesla Optimus (@Tesla_Optimus) December 13, 2023', 'Optimus is not the only humanoid making rapid progress.', 'In February, researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, trained a two-legged robot to walk around San Francisco. The researchers said they had trained the robot on YouTube videos of humans walking, using similar systems to how AI software such as ChatGPT are developed. This gave the robot a greater understanding of the world around it and allowed it to “generalise”, walking on terrains and roads that it had never encountered without having to be shown it beforehand.', 'Jensen Huang, chief executive of AI chip giant Nvidia,, has suggested that these types of advances will lead to progress in robotics dramatically accelerating. Once robots are capable of learning by watching humans move, their progress should be rapid, since footage of people is among the most plentiful data that is out there.', 'Last month, Nvidia unveiled a suite of software called Project GR00T, designed to help humanoid robots learn about the world around them.', '“While the hardware for these robots evolved rapidly over the years, the software lagged behind,” says Deepu Talla, the vice president of robotics and edge computing at Nvidia. “Recent advancements in simulation technology, generative AI and edge computing are closing this gap. Robots are evolving into self-learning machines.”', 'The prospect of useful humanoids being around the corner has led to an investment boom. In February, Nvidia, Microsoft and OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, invested $675m in Figure, a two-year-old Silicon Valley start-up that aims to put robots into warehouses.', 'Amazon has invested in Agility Robotics, another humanoid company. It is already testing Agility’s 5 foot 9 inch bots, which feature glowing white eyes and paddles at the end of their arms, in its warehouses where they move empty boxes. It is a rudimentary task but one that there is a huge market for, says Pras Velagapudi, Agility’s chief architect.', '“We’re already in markets that can support thousands or tens of thousands of robots,” he says. Velagapudi says the next step is expanding its robots’ ability to manipulate objects so it can handle more warehouse jobs.', 'Agility says its goal is for buying a robot to pay off in two years. Its machines will soon be rolling – or walking – off a production line that is scheduled to be operational by the end of the year.', 'China, meanwhile, is pushing ahead with robotics technology as a national priority. Beijing’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology has said it wants to be building humanoids by next year.', 'However, Ash Sharma, the co-founder of Interact Analysis, which advises companies on how to bring automation technologies into their supply chains, says manufacturers are not rushing to buy humanoid robots.', '“It is not a proven use case right now. There are some test cases, some pilots that are happening, but these are not being widely used.” Sharma calls some of the funding going into the industry “eyewatering” given that “No one has said ‘This is the holy grail. This is what we need’.”', 'That might be a relief to today’s factory and warehouse workers. Agility has estimated the cost of “employing” its robot could be around $3 an hour – well below minimum wage. Widespread and cheap humanoids would be likely to set off a new wave of unemployment fears.', 'Sharma believes those concerns are probably overblown. “There is a severe shortage of labour in factories and warehouses. And companies are not able to hire people quickly enough. Companies like Amazon have made it very clear that they are lacking labour. They’ve had to push up wages.”', 'Musk does not agree. In a discussion with Rishi Sunak last year, he told the Prime Minister that “there will come a point where no job is needed… the AI will be able to do everything”.', 'While it may be yet more Musk hyperbole, the world he has imagined is less outlandish than it seemed just a year ago.', 'Broaden your horizons with award-winning British journalism.

Revenue rose 103% in its fiscal second quarter, and management said that its growth rate would accelerate in the next two quarters as it called for 101% to 107% revenue growth for the full fiscal year.', 'Comments from management indicate that the company could be growing even faster if it wasn\'t facing supply constraints. CEO Charles Liang said that while GPU supply is improving, ""Indeed, the demand is still stronger than supply. If we had more supply, we would be able to ship more.""', 'Supermicro also has a close relationship with Nvidia, whose GPUs have become the technological foundation of the AI boom -- Nvidia has greater than a 90% market share in the data center GPU market. The headquarters of both companies are nearby, and its engineers work together to design server systems that fit the needs of its different customer groups.', ""That gives Supermicro a competitive advantage, as does its prowess in offering more customization options than its competitors, and it's also known for bringing products to market faster."", ""Supermicro trades at a reasonable price-to-earnings ratio of less than 50 based on this year's estimate, and it has a market cap of $59 billion. If the company remains a leader in AI servers, the stock could turn $250,000 into $1 million over the coming years."", 'Memory-chip specialist Micron (NASDAQ: MU) emerged as another big potential winner in AI as memory chips play an important role in running the kind of models that make programs like ChatGPT work.', ""Unlike stocks like Supermicro and Nvidia, investors are only starting to catch on to Micron's growth opportunity in AI, and the stock is still affordably priced at a price-to-sales ratio of 4."", 'Micron is just emerging from a downturn in the chip industry as a supply glut driven by a slowdown in PC and tablet sales coming out of the pandemic has weighed on prices. However, artificial intelligence is playing a key role in its comeback. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told investors in the recent earnings call, ""We are in the very early innings of a multiyear growth phase driven by AI as this disruptive technology will transform every aspect of business and society."" He added, ""Memory and storage technologies are key enablers of AI in both training and inference workloads, and Micron is well positioned to capitalize on these trends in both the data center and the edge.""', ""Micron's products also stand out from the competition. For example, its high-memory HBM3E solution provides more than 20 times the memory bandwidth compared to standard server modules and it consumes 30% less power, an important quality in AI hardware, than competing products."", 'The company now expects record revenue in fiscal 2025 and a significant improvement in profitability.

That's likely to take place in June if we consider calendars from previous years."", ""Why do I think Nvidia will make the move soon? For a few reasons. First, as mentioned, Nvidia's last stock split happened when the company's stock price reached similar levels. So, the company has been known to announce such an operation after significant gains and as the stock approached $1,000."", ""Second, a stock price near $1,000 or beyond makes it difficult for some investors to get in on the investment opportunity. Sure, fractional shares exist, but some brokerages don't offer them, and in certain cases, investors prefer buying full shares. Also, other investors may worry that even if valuation looks good, a stock still will struggle to advance significantly once it reaches into the thousands of dollars -- and that could make them hesitate before buying a $900 stock."", 'By splitting its stock, a company erases all of those problems, opening the door to a broader range of investors.', ""Next, it's important to keep in mind that Nvidia has completed five stock splits in the past, meaning the company is amenable to this kind of action. The earlier splits happened between 2000 and 2007."", ""Now, let's consider how a potential split would work and the impact it may have on Nvidia's share performance. During a split, a company offers additional shares to current shareholders to bring down the price of each individual share, while keeping the market value as is. The resulting stock price is determined by the ratio of the split, whether it's 4-for-1 like Nvidia's most recent operation or a different proportion."", ""If you're a current shareholder, the value of your investment will remain the same, but you'll find yourself with additional shares."", ""Stock splits themselves aren't catalysts for share price performance, so I wouldn't count on a potential Nvidia stock split to push the stock higher. To use the past as an example, Nvidia stock didn't immediately rise after the 2021 stock split. The shares did advance later that year, though, but that was thanks to fundamentals, such as gains in revenue."", ""That said, a stock split, by making the shares more accessible to a wide range of investors, may prompt more and more of them to consider the stock rather than to opt for lower-priced players. This is positive over the long term, but doesn't result in sudden share price gains."", ""So, my prediction is the moment is right for Nvidia to split its stock, and it may be the company's next big move.

Millions of computers from manufacturers like Dell and HP have already shipped with AMD's Ryzen AI chips, which allow users to process AI on-device. That leads to a faster, more responsive experience, because AI workloads don't have to travel to and from the data center."", ""In the recent fourth quarter of 2023, the Ryzen AI series sent the company's Client segment revenue up 62% year over year. Combined with the growing shipments of the MI300 chips -- which could generate $3.5 billion in sales in 2024 -- this could be AMD's biggest year."", ""Micron doesn't get as much attention as Nvidia and AMD because it produces memory (DRAM) and storage (NAND) chips, which aren't as glamorous as GPUs. However, every GPU requires memory, and it's critical to extracting its maximum performance."", ""Micron's latest HBM3E (high-bandwidth memory) data center solution was selected by Nvidia to power its new H200. It's an obvious choice because it consumes 30% less power than competing HBM hardware, making it far more cost efficient. Micron is currently sampling a new HBM3E product, which packs 50% more memory into each GPU, allowing Nvidia's customers to bring their AI models to market far more quickly."", ""Micron's entire 2024 HBM inventory is already sold out, and much of its 2025 stock is already spoken for, too."", ""Like AMD, Micron's AI opportunity is expanding beyond the data center. The AI-enabled chipsets inside new personal computers can require 80% more DRAM content than traditional models, which is great for Micron's business. Many modern smartphones are also fitted with AI chips, which need twice as much DRAM as traditional devices. Samsung's new Galaxy S24 comes with a slew of AI features, and it runs on Micron's hardware."", ""Micron's revenue jumped 57% year over year during the fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Feb. 29). The company also delivered net income of $793 million, marking a welcome return to profitability after more than a year grappling with falling prices due to an oversupply of chips."", ""Micron's forecast for the upcoming fiscal 2024 third quarter (ending June 1) points to accelerated revenue growth of 76%. Micron stock is trading at an all-time high, but it's still cheaper than both Nvidia and AMD, so this could be a great buying opportunity for investors."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go directly to the Top 4 Fastest Growing Cities in Texas.', 'Texas is one of the fastest-growing states in the United States, with a population growth of 4.7%. For perspective, out of the five fastest-growing cities in the US, four cities are from the state of Texas. Much of that growth comes from people migrating from the other states. One of the primary reasons why people are moving to Texas in such large numbers is that Texas has a good job market, friendly business environment and a favorable tax system.', 'According to the Texas Workforce Commission (TWC), the Texas labor market is experiencing a record-breaking growth. From January 2023 to January 2024, Texas’ total nonfarm employment grew by 263,900 jobs, showing an annual growth rate of 1.9%. Moreover, the seasonally adjusted civilian labor force in Texas grew by 12,800 people in a month to reach 15,143,400 in January.\xa0', 'On the other hand, the state of California is going through a rough patch with its job market. According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, from January to February, 13,100 more Californians lost their employment and the total number rose to 1,027,000. When one state has a prosperous economy while the other states struggle, people tend to migrate to where the grass looks greener, and this is exactly what happened between California and Texas. A report from the US Census Bureau found that 107,546 people migrated from California to Texas in 2021.\xa0', 'While employment is one reason for the rapid population growth in Texas cities, its tax system is another significant driver of the state’s growth. Texas is one of the very few states with no income and corporate tax. Furthermore, it has a sales tax rate of 6.25%, which is fairly reasonable compared to other states. However, its property tax rate of 1.68% is what concerns many property owners in Texas. Regardless, Texas is a distinguished destination for those who prefer low taxes and a good job market.\xa0', 'Moreover, many Fortune 500 companies like McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE: XOM), and AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) are headquartered in Texas, perhaps to benefit from the zero corporate tax and contribute to the job market.\xa0', 'McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK), the largest pharmaceutical distributor in the US, moved to Irving, Texas, from San Francisco, California, in 2019. McKesson Corp (NYSE:MCK) brought nearly 1,000 jobs to Irving and generated approximately $300 million to $400 million in annual pre-tax gross savings that were realized by the end of fiscal year 2021.', 'Meanwhile, Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM), an American leading oil and gas corporation, is headquartered in the Houston suburb of Spring, Texas. Last year, in 2023, the company announced a strategic $2 billion investment for opening two new chemical production facilities in Baytown, Texas. According to Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM), the project will contribute more than 3,500 construction jobs and when the facilities are fully operational, they will open 200 permanent jobs.', 'On the other hand, AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), a key player in the American telecommunication industry, is headquartered in Dallas, Texas. From 2019 to 2021, AT&T Inc (NYSE:T) has invested more than $7 billion in its wireless and wireline networks. While it has created ample jobs across the country, the company is on an aggressive cost-cutting campaign and its workforce has shrunk by over 120,000 since 2016.', 'By 2100, Texas is on-track to be one of the most populated states in the US. Similar to these three companies, other companies operating in Texas are also helping strengthen the job market of the state, which in turn, is helping contribute to the growing population in the state. Below, we’ve listed the top 10 fastest-growing cities in Texas.', 'Top 10 Fastest Growing Cities in Texas.', 'In this article, we have listed the top 10 fastest-growing cities in Texas. We have ranked the cities using data collected by the US Census Bureau which provided us a list of annual population estimates for over 800 US cities. We used data obtained for 2020-2022, and shortlisted Texan cities from the list. We then calculated the percentage change in population from 2020 to 2022 for all the cities in Texas and selected the top 10 cities that experienced the highest population growth in these years. The cities in our list are ranked based on the ascending order of their percentage growth in population between 2020 and 2022.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Between 2020 and 2022, within a span of 2 years, the city’s population surged by 7.80%. According to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2023 estimates, the city’s current population is 51,461. Rockwall boasts scenic beauty, award-winning schools, and a thriving community. While residents cherish outdoor spots like Robin Bledsoe Park and Lakewood Park, the city’s proximity to Austin adds to its allure. Notable restaurants include Bella Sera of Leander and Mouton’s Southern Bistro, as Rockwall continues to grow, it remains a vibrant and attractive place.', 'Percentage Change in Population (2020-2022): 8.24%', 'Temple, a city located in Bell County Texas, has experienced remarkable growth in recent years as well. Between 2020 and 2022, its population surged by 8.24%, and the current population of the city stands at over 89,000. The surge in the city’s population is also reflected in its housing landscape. Furthermore, according to Census data, owner-occupied housing units constitute 52.8% of the total housing units with the median value per unit being $191,300. For homeowners with a mortgage, the median monthly cost is $1,495, while those without a mortgage pay $595. Additionally, the median gross rent for renters is $1088 per month.

The Temple Economic Development Corporation also reported that the city government aims to continue to “reinvest added tax revenue into revitalization projects that boost the city’s livability.”', 'Percentage Change in Population (2020-2022): 8.30%', 'Frisco, a vibrant city in Texas, has witnessed remarkable growth in recent years, reflecting the city’s allure as a dynamic and thriving community. Among the diverse races contributing to the city’s increasing population, white residents form the majority — comprising 53.6% of the population. Meanwhile, Asians make up 25.5% of the population of Frisco, and black or African American residents make up 9.2% of it. Furthermore, more than 6,000 veterans reside in Frisco, contributing to the city’s rich tapestry of experiences. Alongside this, 25.3% of the city’s population consists of foreign-born individuals, which adds to the cultural diversity and global perspectives to the city’s community.', 'Percentage Change in Population (2020-2022): 11.13%', ""Conroe, nestled in Montgomery County and located 40 miles north of Houston, has an impressive count of around 101,405 people living in the city. Approximately 35,433 households dot the landscape, each comprising around 2.56 persons, demonstrating how families play a significant role in the surging number of residents in the city. Furthermore, the population aged less than 5 makes up 7.2% of the city's population, with 24.3% being adults and 14.2% being senior citizens. The remaining almost half of the population is composed of female residents. Conroe is best known for its lake and the historic downtown Conroe area. The city also has lots of greenery and is one of the best places to live in the state."", 'Percentage Change in Population (2020-2022): 11.23%', 'Ranked 6th, Burleson is another Texan city that is growing fast. With a population of over 53,000 as of July 1, 2022, estimated by the Census, Burleson has a modest size, but a healthy economy. The city’s economy reflects a mix of services, healthcare, and retail sectors, aligning with its growing population.

There's a big shareholder meeting taking place on Wednesday. And it's not the only thing that Disney shareholders will be watching that day."", ""There's a contested proxy battle and some horror on the silver screen. Meanwhile, Disney's theme parks will have some new moves to keep their turnstiles clicking. Let's take a closer look at the things to watch in the month ahead."", ""Investors have probably been circling Wednesday on the calendar for a couple of months now. It's the day of Disney's annual shareholder meeting, but there will be some more fireworks than usual. A pair of activist groups are trying to shake up the boardroom, offering up a couple of nominees to replace current directors."", ""Disney stock hit another 52-week high last week. CEO Bob Iger has momentum, and it's hard to see shareholders voting for change. However, Disney has been pushing its shareholders to vote in recent weeks. Disney's also been lining up public endorsements of prolific shareholders. Is the House of Mouse trying so hard because it fears it will lose?"", ""The more likely scenario is that Disney knows it will win. However, it needs a definitive drubbing of the activists. It was 20 years ago today that then-CEO Michael Eisner saw a pair of board members step down and rally against Disney's helmsman. A whopping 45% at the 2004 shareholder meeting voiced their displeasure. That wasn't quite enough to unseat Eisner from the boardroom, but the writing was on the wall. He stepped down a few months later. Iger, similarly, can't just win this week. He needs to come out on top in resounding fashion."", ""It's not just the boardroom that has a wish. Disney's Wish will make its streaming service debut on Disney+ on Wednesday. The film flopped at the multiplex last year, failing to top $64 million in domestic ticket sales. Disney's original animated features were once a slam dunk. Last year there were 40 other theatrical releases that fared better."", ""Wish was a bigger hit internationally, generating $254 million in global box office receipts, and streaming on Disney+ could help improve the film's visibility. Disney already saw Encanto blow up after an initially lackluster run on the big screen. But with just 2% of the country having seen Wish in theaters, it's time for a formal introduction of the movie to the rest of the Disney fan base."", 'Disney largely struggled at the box office last year, and 2024 is off to an even worse start. It has limited its movie theater releases to three animated films -- Luca, Soul, and Turning Red -- that sidestepped the multiplex to reach consumers directly early in the pandemic through Disney+.', ""It's not a surprise that they have fared poorly in the past three months. Fans have been streaming the films for a couple of years now. The best performer of the three sold just $1.4 million in admissions. Now is when Disney starts turning up the heat."", ""Disney's 20th Century Studios will release The First Omen on Thursday. It's a prequel to the 1976 classic The Omen. But if the film doesn't fare well, it won't be a reason for Disney investors to worry. It has at least one potential box office blockbuster in its arsenal every month now through the end of the calendar year."", 'Long before Disney acquired Lucasfilm, it struck a deal to open a Star Wars-themed attraction at some of its theme parks. Star Tours has entertained fans of the iconic sci-fi series since 1987. A neat feature of the galactic flight simulator is that it can refresh the attraction simply by changing the film and programming of the vehicle movements.', 'Disney is updating the ride starting this weekend by adding characters and storylines from some of the Star Wars Disney+ shows. New adventures on Star Tours will feature Ahsoka, Andor, and The Mandalorian. The update will take place at Disney parks in Florida, California, and France. As a leading entertainment stock, Disney knows how to milk the most of its properties through its rich ecosystem.', 'April is going to be an important month for Disney.

Two new directors who are qualified and capable of leading needed change in corporate governance will serve the Disney board well.""6', 'Similarly, Neuberger Berman wrote that:', '“We believe there is opportunity to strengthen relevant policies and practices and that the board may benefit from the addition of a fresh perspective and more independence. For these reasons, we intend to support the election of dissident Trian nominees Nelson Peltz and James Rasulo to the board.”7', '“[W]e believe [Trian’s] nominees are very strong candidates given Peltz’s large ownership of the company and extensive board experience and Rasulo’s long-term experience while working as an executive at Disney.”8', '“[W]e do not believe short-term TSR performance alone is an adequate indicator of the quality of governance at a company. Despite recent improvements, in our opinion, the deficiencies of the board that ultimately led to the failed 2020 succession endeavor and related consequences remain. As such, we are unconvinced of the current board’s ability to uphold good governance practices and fulfill one of its core responsibilities in finding a CEO successor.9', '“[W]e have concerns regarding the Disney board’s multi-year efforts to name a successor to CEO Bob Iger. . . . The board has admitted to not adhering to and executing the process it had in place for Disney’s 2020 succession plan and that Chapek’s appointment was a strategic misstep. . . . [W]e believe these succession planning challenges have impacted business continuity and distracted from business performance.”10', 'Other investors and independent proxy advisory firms have also indicated their support for Nelson Peltz and Trian.', 'Yacktman Asset Management, a value-focused investment firm, wrote:', '“Nelson Peltz has been a director, and Trian has been a significant shareholder, of several companies in our investment portfolio. As a director, Nelson has brought tremendous energy and focus to his work, successfully collaborating with management teams and his fellow directors to improve the companies for the benefit of all stakeholders.”11', 'ISS, the largest and most influential proxy advisory firm, concluded that:', '“[I]ncremental change is needed at the company due to multi-year underperformance [relative to] the company’s peers and chosen benchmark, operational challenges, and most critically, a repeated failure on the part of the board to oversee the cultivation of a successor to Iger.”', '“[T]he key decision points that led to the company’s challenges over the past five years, not to mention multiple activist campaigns, can be traced to the board.”', '“. . . Peltz, as a significant shareholder, could be additive to the succession process, providing assurance to other investors that the board is properly engaged this time around. He could also help evaluate future capital allocation decisions.”', 'Egan-Jones, another independent proxy advisory firm, also recommended that shareholders vote for change in the composition of Disney’s Board. Egan-Jones concluded: “We see very little downside and a lot of upsides in putting the Trian Nominees on the Board,”12 citing an “apparent lack of a . . . long-term succession plan”13 and “mediocre financial performance and the resultant lower valuation”14 as reasons for shareholders to vote “For” both of Trian’s nominees, Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo, and “Withhold” on Maria Elena Lagomasino and Michael B.G. Froman.', 'Trian commented on the votes and recommendations from these influential investors and research firms:', 'While Disney has touted the endorsements15 of its service providers16 and advisors,17 we are pleased to have earned the support of independent, respected institutional investors and proxy advisory firms.', 'Like CalPERS, Neuberger Berman, Yacktman, ISS, Egan-Jones, and others, we believe that change is needed at Disney and that the election of our nominees will help improve the focus, alignment and accountability of the Board.', 'We are confident that Nelson and Jay will be far more effective in “refocusing the board on CEO succession planning”18 and “aligning the board with shareholder interests”19 than the directors we are seeking to replace, Maria Elena Lagomasino and Michael B.G. Froman. These long-serving incumbent directors have overseen Disney’s protracted succession planning failures, persistent underperformance20 and questionable strategic and capital allocation decisions.', 'By Disney’s own admission, Ms. Lagomasino and Mr. Froman – one an advisor to wealthy families and the other with experience in foreign affairs – possess just one skill central to the Company’s strategy,21 a skill possessed by every other incumbent director and by Nelson and Jay. Neither Ms. Lagomasino nor Mr. Froman is well aligned with shareholders, unlike Nelson and Jay, because neither owns meaningful amounts of Disney stock.22', 'Critically, Ms. Lagomasino has failed shareholders as the Chair (and previously as a member) of the Compensation Committee.23 Disney’s executives have been paid more than $1 billion in the last decade, even as the stock significantly underperformed the S&P 500.24 Disney’s shareholders have long expressed displeasure with Disney’s compensation program25 and yet Ms. Lagomasino remains in her role. Her failure to help align pay and performance is evident not just at Disney, but also at the other companies on whose compensation committee she serves or served, Coca-Cola and Avon Products, over many years.26', 'As we have said from the beginning, this election contest is not about Disney’s CEO, it is about improving the focus, alignment and accountability of Disney’s Board so that the Company can return to delighting its consumers and delivering value for its owners. In that context, we do not believe Ms. Lagomasino or Mr. Froman deserves shareholder support. Change is needed.', 'Our nominees, Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo, bring relevant experience and pledge to work constructively and collaboratively with the Board, as they have done with other boards many times before. Nelson and Jay will bring a much-needed shareholder perspective to the boardroom and will ask tough questions, encourage open discussion and debate and set demanding goals for the business.', 'To help ensure a better future for this great company, we urge shareholders to vote “For” Nelson Peltz and Jay Rasulo and to withhold support from Ms. Lagomasino and Mr. Froman today.

It has a history spanning nearly 100 years, one full of fantastic storytelling and memorable experiences."", ""The House of Mouse has a track record of winning over fans through video entertainment. And keeping this background in mind, it's encouraging that the company launched its own flagship Disney+ streaming service in November 2019. As of Dec. 30, 2023, it counted 111.3 million subscribers, easily making it one of the most popular choices on the market."", ""But if you're looking for a magnificent streaming stock to add to your portfolio, forget about Disney. Buy and hold this industry leader instead."", 'The streaming business that deserves your attention is none other than Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX). After adding 29.5 million net new customers in 2023, it has 260.3 million subscribers right now. Even on an already massive user base, the company is finding ways to increase its member count.', 'This is in stark contrast with Disney+. Yes, it deserves credit for reaching over 111 million customers in less than five years. However, there could be signs that it has reached a peak.', 'In the latest fiscal quarter (Q1 2024 ended Dec. 30), Disney+ Core (excluding Hotstar) saw its subscriber count shrink by 1% on a quarter-over-quarter basis. Executives pointed to price hikes as the reason for why more members chose to cancel their plans.', ""Pricing power is where Netflix truly shines. Last October, it raised prices on its Basic plan in the U.S. by $2 per month. However, that didn't prevent the company from adding 2.8 million net new users in the U.S. and Canada region in Q4, while also posting a 3% increase in average revenue per member."", ""Consumers are giving investors tremendous insights here. Netflix is the top streaming choice, even as its price goes up. That's something Disney+ hasn't been able to compete with thus far."", ""When it comes to profitability, Netflix again runs circles around Walt Disney. Disney's direct-to-consumer (DTC) operations, which is where Disney+ and the stake in Hulu get reported, posted a $138 million operating loss last fiscal quarter. Credit is given for bringing this down from the nearly $1 billion loss in Q1 2023. Disney is embarking on a broader plan for the entire business to cut about $7.5 billion in expenses by the end of the current fiscal year."", 'But we can\'t ignore the fact the DTC segment keeps losing money.

Warren Buffett’s annual shareholders letter to Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A)(NYSE:BRK-B) investors outlines what he’s done the past year and often why. Along the way, he drops pearls of wisdom and golden nuggets of investing truths.', 'Yet it’s not so much what Buffett says but what he does. As a super investor he doesn’t have to play by the same rules as you and me. The SEC affords him and other billionaires special privileges they withhold from us. For example, Buffett doesn’t always have to divulge his big bets to ensure he gets the best price.', 'However, Buffett also has a secret stash that not many investors are familiar with. Berkshire Hathaway acquired specialty investment company New England Asset Management (NEAM) when it bought General Re in 1998. It’s a “secret” portfolio with numerous hidden gems, companies that don’t always appear in Berkshire Hathaway’s portfolio. While Buffett doesn’t actively manage the investment portfolio as he does with his primary vehicle, Berkshire still effectively owns its assets.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'NEAM recently purchased the following three Warren Buffett stocks, hiding in plain sight.', 'Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com', 'It’s no secret Buffett likes a bargain and stocks trading at a discount to their intrinsic value. Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) fits the bill as its stock trades 32% below where it stood a year ago and regularly tests new lows. PFE stock recently touched a level it hadn’t seen in a decade.', 'The loss of revenue from its Covid therapeutics is sinking the company.

Yet, almost all have suffered significant sales declines or posted anemic growth. Eliquis and Prevnar, for example, were up 4% and 2%, respectively; Xeljanz and Enbrel were off 5% and 17%, respectively; revenue from oncology treatments Ibrance and Xtandi fell 7% and 1%, respectively.', 'Although some therapies grew by double-digit rates, the overall effect was a 42% decline in sales in 2023. Yet the stock is cheap. It trades at only 10 times next year’s earnings, which are expected to grow by 23%.

AMGN shares are down 4% this year but 20% higher over the last 12 months.', 'The biotech’s own portfolio of billion-dollar drugs did grow year over year, though not as quickly as some hoped. Yet Amgen has a robust pipeline of therapies that will be key in defending its portfolio from biosimilars even as it pursues it’s own development of biosimilar drugs.', 'Amgen also has a solid presence internationally in its core therapeutic circle of competency. New acquisitions strengthen its ability to identify potential new drug targets. Recently launched branded and biosimilar drugs should allow the biotech to maintain its strong record of returning value to shareholders.', 'With Amgen stock trading at 13 times next year’s earnings and 20 times its free cash flow, NEAM saw this as an opportunity to add to its position.', 'Source: photosounds / Shutterstock.com', 'Electric utility Exelon (NYSE:EXC) is another beaten down stock, though nowhere near Pfizer or Amgen.

It saw revenue in the fourth quarter rise 15% to $5.4 billion as higher utility rates went into effect.', 'Inflation and higher interest rates pressure Exelon’s performance, as they do most capital-intensive businesses. Although the Federal Reserve didn’t cut rates at its latest meeting it did indicate rate cuts were coming later this year, which helped lift the utility sector.

That's certainly the case when it comes to generating passive income. Most sources require an upfront investment to get the income train chugging along. However, once the income starts flowing, it can be meaningful."", ""Investing in dividend stocks is one of the quickest, and easiest, ways to start collecting passive income.

On top of that, this particular trio has a knack for increasing their dividends, suggesting investors should be able to collect a steadily rising income stream in the coming years. "", ""Another great thing about dividend stocks is you don't need a lot of money to get started generating income. It only costs between $40 and $80 to buy a share of Oneok, Verizon, and W.P. Carey. That enables you to start small and slowly build your passive income portfolio."", ""Here's a look at why these dividend stocks are great income building blocks to consider buying this April."", ""Oneok has been a model dividend payer. The pipeline stock has delivered more than a quarter century of dividend stability and growth. While it hasn't increased its payout every year, the dividend has steadily marched higher. Over the past decade, Oneok has delivered a more than 150% increase in its payout. "", 'The pipeline company expects to continue growing its payout in the future. Its target is to deliver 3% to 4% annual growth. Several factors fuel that view. ', ""Oneok is coming off a transformational year. It closed its $18.8 billion acquisition of Magellan Midstream Partners last year, which diversified its operations while setting the stage for future free cash flow growth. On top of that, it's investing in several high-return organic expansion projects. It recently approved a $355 million expansion of its Elk Creek Pipeline that should enter service by the first quarter of next year. Meanwhile, it's progressing toward approving its Saguaro Connector Pipeline, aiming to start construction later this year. Combine these growth catalysts with its strong financial profile, and Oneok should have the fuel to deliver steady dividend growth in the coming years. "", 'Verizon also has an excellent track record of increasing its dividend. The telecom giant delivered its 17th straight year of dividend growth in 2023, the longest current streak in the U.S. telecom sector. While Verizon is growing its payout at a modest pace of about 2% annually in recent years, it should continue its slow and steady trudge higher. ', 'The mobile and broadband company generates lots of cash to fund its expansion, pay dividends, and strengthen its balance sheet. It produced $37.5 billion of cash flow from operations last year, funding its capital investments ($18.8 billion) and dividend ($11 billion), with $7.7 billion to spare. That excess free cash flow enabled Verizon to strengthen its already solid financial profile. ', ""Verizon's cash flow should rise in the future as its capital investments to build out its faster 5G network start paying off. Meanwhile, costs are coming down as it moderates capital spending ($17 billion to $17.5 billion in 2024) and cuts operating costs ($2 billion to $3 billion by 2025). These initiatives should boost its free cash flow, giving it more money to pay dividends and bolster its balance sheet. "", 'W.P. Carey is coming off a quarter century of annual dividend increases. Unfortunately, that streak ended late last year after the real estate investment trust (REIT) cut its payout by about 20%. It made that move following the sale and spinoff of its office properties. The company reset its payout to reflect its lower earnings and to increase the cash flow it retains to help fund new investments. ', 'However, W.P. Carey has already gotten back on the dividend growth bandwagon this year. It expects to deliver a rising dividend in the future as it increases its rental income. The REIT is in the process of recycling the proceeds from its office sales, and other recent sales, into new investments in healthier sectors, such as industrial, that should grow its rental income. ', 'The company believes its repositioned portfolio and stronger financial profile will put its dividend on an even stronger long-term foundation. Its focus on faster-growing sectors should enable it to grow its rental income (and dividend) at higher rates in the future.', 'Oneok, Verizon, and W.P. Carey offer higher dividend yields, enabling you to generate more income per dollar invested. In addition, those payouts should steadily rise in the future.

The company increased its net income by $478 million in the fourth quarter and $1.2 billion in 2023 overall.', 'The company was already telegraphing strength weeks earlier when it increased its dividend by more than 6%.

Back in 2016, Cheniere Energy became the first American company to export liquefied natural gas.

It’s essentially a byproduct of oil exploration and thus the company is less sensitive to gas price fluctuations.

If you share my opinion, the outlook remains positive for energy prices, and the U.S. housing market will recover in time. Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) and Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR) are great buys right now. However, despite being an exciting investing proposition in its own right, 3M (NYSE: MMM) is not the stock high-yield investors should be buying. Here's why."", 'Devon Energy pays a fixed-plus-variable dividend, using the remaining free cash flow after the fixed dividend (currently $0.22 a quarter) is paid and share buybacks are completed.', ""It's a flexible strategy. When management feels its stock is undervalued, it prioritizes share buybacks. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2023, management retired 5.2 million shares for $234 million, paid a fixed dividend of $0.20 per share for $127 million, and paid a variable dividend of $0.22 per share using $140 million."", 'The chart below shows Devon has a pretty good track record of reducing its share count. High-yield investors should welcome this as it increases the share of their claim on future cash flows from Devon Energy.', 'Devon also has a good track record of growing resources, not least through extensions and discoveries.', ""By my calculations, based on a price of oil of $80 per barrel in management's 2024 projections and the current share price of $48.37, Devon's free-cash-flow (FCF) yield could be almost 10% in 2024. Given that management is targeting to return 70% of FCF to investors in 2024, there should be ample room to pay a hefty dividend as well as buying back shares to enhance the dividend per share in the future."", ""While it's not clear what the variable dividend will be in 2024, at the current price of oil, Devon has plenty of potential to pay a substantial dividend this year."", ""It won't be a vintage year for Whirlpool in terms of its headline numbers. Over an extended period, relatively high interest rates are slowing the housing market and putting pressure on household appliance sales. Given that existing home sales drive 25% of U.S. demand for appliances, and 15% comes from new home sales, it's no surprise to learn that Whirlpool expects its 2024 comparable sales to be flat with 2023 at $16.9 billion, with its earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin also flat for 2023 at 6.8%."", ""There's very little Whirlpool can do about its end markets, but it can change where it focuses on operating. That's exactly what management is doing by agreeing to transfer its major European domestic appliances business to Arcelik's European business while obtaining a 25% stake in the new company. It's a good move, as Whirlpool's European business has bled cash in eight of the last 15 years and had an EBIT margin of just 1.8% in 2023."", ""As such, Whirlpool will focus more on its core North American market, which is on track to generate a 9% EBIT margin in 2024. In addition, management's cost-cutting measures took $800 million out of costs in 2023, and it plans to take $300 million to $400 million out in 2024. These actions should set Whirlpool up nicely to benefit from a lower interest rate in North America in the future."", ""There is a value case for buying 3M stock, not least as management's restructuring actions hopefully turn around its lackluster margin performance in recent years. In addition, there are some signs of improvement in some of its key end markets, such as consumer electronics, semiconductors, and electronics."", 'That said, the spinoff of its healthcare business, Solventum, will take away a valuable source of reliable cash flows.

The bottom line is that 3M can maintain its dividend at the current level, but using cash to restructure an ailing company might not be the best use of shareholders' money."", 'Finally, 3M\'s current CEO, Michael Roman (who will become executive chairman on May 1), has fallen short of explicitly confirming the dividend will be maintained at the current level after the Solventum spinoff, but has promised ""an attractive dividend.""', ""Therefore, don't be surprised if 3M cuts its dividend in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in 3M right now?', 'Before you buy stock in 3M, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and 3M wasn’t one of them.

Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) has taken the exact opposite approach. So while the dividend yield on major quote services is listed as 4.9%, you shouldn't count on that figure. Here's what you need to know and why future dividends from Devon are anything but set in stone."", ""Devon Energy is part of the energy sector, as its name implies, producing oil and natural gas from its onshore U.S. assets. It operates in the Williston Basin, Powder River Basin, Anadarko Basin, Delaware Basin, and Eagle Ford. Production increased by 8% in 2023 over 2022 levels. The company estimates that its break-even price in 2024 will be $45 per barrel or less, well below the industry average, which is closer to $55 per barrel. Management believes it has at least 10 years' worth of drilling opportunities ahead of it."", ""Devon Energy's business looks like it is on fairly solid ground, and it also possesses an investment-grade balance sheet. The 4.9% dividend yield, meanwhile, is above the energy industry average of roughly 3.2%, using Vanguard Energy Index ETF (NYSEMKT: VDE) as a proxy. But hold on a second before you hit the buy button."", ""Devon Energy's dividend yield is based on the last four dividend payments, which add up to $2.42 per share. Normally when you calculate a dividend, you take the most recent dividend and annualize it. The most recent quarterly dividend from Devon Energy was $0.44 per share, down from the prior quarter's $0.77. If you annualize $0.44, you get $1.76 per share, which results in a yield of around 3.6%. While that's still higher than the average energy stock, it's not nearly as attractive as 4.9%. What's going on?"", ""Devon Energy has a variable dividend policy that is tied to its financial performance. Operating in the energy sector as an oil and natural gas producer, its financial results are directly tied to the price of the commodities it sells. Oil and natural gas are prone to swift and often dramatic price swings. So Devon Energy's financial results are volatile and so, too, is its variable dividend."", ""Some numbers will help illustrate this. In the first quarter of 2023, Devon's per-share dividend was $0.89. In Q2 2023, the dividend fell to $0.72. It declined again in the third quarter, hitting $0.49 before rising in Q4 to $0.77. The first-quarter 2024 dividend, as previously noted, was $0.44 per share. Now that's a lot of variability! And as the chart below shows, the dividend's ups and downs track along with the price of oil, with a slight lag."", ""To be fair, the company has recently decided to shift priorities with regard to returning cash to shareholders. It is going to be putting additional emphasis on stock buybacks, which basically means less cash will go out in the form of dividends. But that doesn't change the nature of the dividend policy or nature of the company's business."", ""So the answer to the question of where Devon Energy's dividend will be in a year is, well, unknowable. Adding up the last four dividend payments, while not ideal, is probably the best that can be done to give investors a modicum of insight into the company's dividend. But there is one thing we do know for certain: Dividend levels in the future will be tied to the price of oil and natural gas (with a slight lag). That's not, perhaps, the answer a dividend investor wants to hear, but it is a very important one to understand."", 'If you are looking for consistent dividends, Devon Energy is not the energy stock for you. You will be better off with an integrated energy giant like Chevron (NYSE: CVX). Chevron has increased its dividend annually for 36 consecutive years and the yield is currently around 4.2%. Dividend consistency is an obvious goal for Chevron, but it is not for Devon Energy.', ""For some investors, Devon Energy's dividend policy will be unappealing. But that doesn't make it an inherently bad policy. In fact, it ensures that shareholders benefit directly when energy prices are on the rise. The problem is that it also requires investors to share the pain when energy prices fall and the dividend inevitably gets cut."", 'Before you buy Devon Energy, make sure you understand that there is no way to predict what the dividend payment will be, and therefore no way to really know how much income the stock will generate for you. What you do know, however, is that if energy prices go up, you will benefit from a rising income stream, perhaps offering you a hedge of sorts for the real-world costs of heating your home and filling up your gas tank.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Devon Energy wasn’t one of them.

They supply investors with passive income. Further, REITs have historically outperformed the S&P 500 over the longer term.', ""On top of all that, our research has found that many REITs deliver those higher returns with less volatility compared to the broader market. Three REITs have stood out for their ability to produce high returns with lower volatility: Realty Income (NYSE: O), Essex Property Trust (NYSE: ESS), and Public Storage (NYSE: PSA). Here's a look at these reliable REITs."", ""Realty Income stands out among REITs. The diversified REIT has delivered a 13.9% compound annual total return since its public market listing in 1994. While that's not the highest return over that period, it has delivered one of the best returns per unit of risk as measured by beta:"", 'As that slide shows, Realty Income is in the 90th percentile among S&P 500 members for the return it delivers per unit of risk. A big driver is its low beta, the second lowest among REITs in the S&P 500.', ""Several factors drive Realty Income's low volatility. A big one is the overall stability of its cash flow. The company owns commercial properties secured by long-term net leases with high-quality tenants in industries relatively immune to economic downturns and the disruption of e-commerce (e.g., grocery stores, home improvement centers, and warehouses). The net lease structure requires the tenant to cover maintenance, building insurance, and real estate taxes. This business model enables it to generate very stable cash flow, three-quarters of which it pays investors via its monthly dividend. "", ""Realty Income also has one of the highest credit ratings in the REIT sector. The company's combination of a durable portfolio and strong financial profile allows it to steadily grow its portfolio, cash flow, and dividend (106 consecutive quarterly increases). That drives reliable returns for its investors. "", ""Essex Property Trust has also delivered strong returns for less risk. The apartment REIT has delivered a 13.7% compound annual growth rate in its total return since its initial public offering in 1994. That's the highest return among multifamily focused REITs. The company has delivered those returns with less volatility than the broader market (0.8 average beta over the last five years). "", 'A few factors have helped drive its reliable returns. A big one is its focus on housing-constrained markets along the West Coast. That has helped drive above-average net operating income growth compared to other REITs due to high occupancy levels and higher average rent growth. The company also has done an excellent job of investing capital to expand its portfolio via high-return acquisitions and development projects. These catalysts have helped drive above-average cash flow per share growth, enabling Essex Property Trust to deliver peer-leading dividend growth (487% over the last three decades). ', 'Essex Property Trust backs its strong portfolio with a rock-solid balance sheet. Its strong credit rating gives it the financial flexibility to make value-enhancing investments. ', 'Public Storage has the lowest volatility among REITs in the S&P 500 (around 0.5 times over the past five years). The self-storage REIT has also delivered an impressive 12.4% average annual return since going public several decades ago. ', 'Its focus on self-storage properties is a big factor driving its reliable, low-volatility returns. They have a low break-even point (40% to 45% occupancy compared to 60% or more for multifamily properties), enabling the company to consistently generate strong earnings. Meanwhile, demand for self-storage properties tends to be relatively recession-resistant. On top of that, demand for space in those facilities has been steadily rising as more people use them to store their stuff. These catalysts have helped drive strong occupancy and rental growth rates for self-storage operators over the years. Since 2004, its same-store net operating income has grown at a 5.1% compound annual rate, much faster than the core real estate sector average of 2.9%. ', ""Another factor driving Public Storage's low volatility is its fortress-like balance sheet. It has one of the highest credit ratings in the REIT sector. That gives it the flexibility to invest in high-return development projects and make accretive acquisitions. "", 'Realty Income, Essex Property Trust, and Public Storage have been fantastic long-term investments. The REITs have delivered strong returns with a lot less volatility than the broader market. Given the durability of their business models and their strong financial profiles, these top REITs should be able to continue delivering reliable returns for their investors in the decades ahead.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

Revenue rose 103% in its fiscal second quarter, and management said that its growth rate would accelerate in the next two quarters as it called for 101% to 107% revenue growth for the full fiscal year.', 'Comments from management indicate that the company could be growing even faster if it wasn\'t facing supply constraints. CEO Charles Liang said that while GPU supply is improving, ""Indeed, the demand is still stronger than supply. If we had more supply, we would be able to ship more.""', 'Supermicro also has a close relationship with Nvidia, whose GPUs have become the technological foundation of the AI boom -- Nvidia has greater than a 90% market share in the data center GPU market. The headquarters of both companies are nearby, and its engineers work together to design server systems that fit the needs of its different customer groups.', ""That gives Supermicro a competitive advantage, as does its prowess in offering more customization options than its competitors, and it's also known for bringing products to market faster."", ""Supermicro trades at a reasonable price-to-earnings ratio of less than 50 based on this year's estimate, and it has a market cap of $59 billion. If the company remains a leader in AI servers, the stock could turn $250,000 into $1 million over the coming years."", 'Memory-chip specialist Micron (NASDAQ: MU) emerged as another big potential winner in AI as memory chips play an important role in running the kind of models that make programs like ChatGPT work.', ""Unlike stocks like Supermicro and Nvidia, investors are only starting to catch on to Micron's growth opportunity in AI, and the stock is still affordably priced at a price-to-sales ratio of 4."", 'Micron is just emerging from a downturn in the chip industry as a supply glut driven by a slowdown in PC and tablet sales coming out of the pandemic has weighed on prices. However, artificial intelligence is playing a key role in its comeback. CEO Sanjay Mehrotra told investors in the recent earnings call, ""We are in the very early innings of a multiyear growth phase driven by AI as this disruptive technology will transform every aspect of business and society."" He added, ""Memory and storage technologies are key enablers of AI in both training and inference workloads, and Micron is well positioned to capitalize on these trends in both the data center and the edge.""', ""Micron's products also stand out from the competition. For example, its high-memory HBM3E solution provides more than 20 times the memory bandwidth compared to standard server modules and it consumes 30% less power, an important quality in AI hardware, than competing products."", 'The company now expects record revenue in fiscal 2025 and a significant improvement in profitability. Based on that momentum and its leadership in memory chips, Micron could also grow by four times over the coming years from its current market cap of $130 billion, turning $250,000 into a million dollars.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

AMD is already shipping the MI300A to the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory for its El Capitan supercomputer, which will be one of the most powerful in the world when it comes online this year. But a number of leading data center operators, including Microsoft, Oracle, and Meta Platforms, are also lining up to buy the MI300 series."", ""While AMD is chasing Nvidia in the data center, the company has a dominant market share of 90% in the emerging AI-enabled personal computing industry. Millions of computers from manufacturers like Dell and HP have already shipped with AMD's Ryzen AI chips, which allow users to process AI on-device. That leads to a faster, more responsive experience, because AI workloads don't have to travel to and from the data center."", ""In the recent fourth quarter of 2023, the Ryzen AI series sent the company's Client segment revenue up 62% year over year.

Palantir, meanwhile, is up more than 42% this year following a sharp surge in the wake of its latest quarterly results. And now, it looks like Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) and Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) are set to join the bandwagon as well and witness a parabolic jump in their share prices.', ""A parabolic move refers to a big jump in the stock price of a company in a short period, like the right side of a parabolic curve. Shares of both Broadcom and Micron have seen big jumps in their stock prices of late thanks to their growing AI credentials. More importantly, it won't be surprising to see them sustain their recent pops and go on a parabolic run."", 'Broadcom stock recently got a shot in the arm following an investor event called ""Enabling AI in Infrastructure."" During this event, Broadcom revealed that it now has three customers for its custom AI chips. For comparison, on its earnings conference call earlier this month, Broadcom management said it is witnessing ""strong demand for our custom AI accelerators at our two hyperscale customers.""', ""Broadcom's custom AI processors were already being used by the likes of Meta Platforms and Alphabet, and speculation indicates that the new addition could be Amazon, Apple, or TikTok parent company ByteDance. It is worth noting that Broadcom was already enjoying rapid growth in AI chip sales before this new customer came on board. The chipmaker's AI revenue quadrupled on a year-over-year basis in the previous quarter to $2.3 billion."", ""What's more, Broadcom was expecting to finish fiscal 2024 with more than $10 billion in AI revenue even before the new customer came on board. Now that the company expects to ramp up the production of AI chips for its new customers this year itself, there is a good chance that it could very well exceed its forecast."", ""The company was originally expecting AI to account for a quarter of its total revenue this year, up from 15% in the previous fiscal year. However, AI seems set to move the needle in a bigger way for Broadcom. More importantly, the company's solid share of the application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) market means that it can win big from the growing demand for custom AI accelerators in the long run."", ""All this explains why analyst sentiment around Broadcom is improving following the company's latest event. Investment bank TD Cowen has raised its Broadcom price target to $1,500 from $1,400, while also raising the rating on the stock to outperform from market perform."", ""With Broadcom stock trading at 28 times forward earnings, in line with the Nasdaq-100's forward earnings multiple, now looks like a good time to buy the stock. Broadcom seems on track to outpace Wall Street's growth expectations on account of its new AI customer, which could encourage the market to reward it with a higher earnings multiple and potentially send the stock on a parabolic run."", ""Micron Technology stock jumped 14% following its second-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings report (for the quarter ended Feb. 29, 2024), which was released on March 20. AI played a central role in Micron's surge as the growing demand for memory chips used in AI servers, personal computers (PCs), and smartphones led to a big year-over-year jump in the company's revenue and earnings."", ""The chipmaker's revenue shot up 58% year over year to $5.82 billion. It swung to an adjusted profit of $0.42 per share from a loss of $1.91 per share in the same period last year. Analysts would have settled for a loss of $0.25 per share on $5.35 billion in revenue. The good part is that Micron's growth is set to accelerate in the current quarter.

Nvidia sold $47.5 billion worth of data center chips in fiscal 2024 (which ended in January this year).', ""Its revenue from this segment more than tripled year over year in fiscal 2024. And the massive revenue opportunity that Huang sees means that the company's data center business still has a lot of room for growth, especially considering that it reportedly has a near monopoly in the AI chip market with an estimated market share of 95%."", ""The arrival of the company's next-generation Blackwell AI GPUs later this year could help Nvidia maintain its tight grip over this market. The upcoming chips are four times faster than the current-generation Hopper chips for AI training, and they are said to be 30 times faster in AI inference workloads."", 'The new graphics cards are reportedly going to be priced between $30,000 and $40,000, which would be a bump from the $20,000 to $30,000 price range of the current H100 graphics cards. Given that these new chips reportedly cost $6,000 to manufacture, Nvidia is likely to make a solid profit on its next-generation AI chips.', 'All this explains why 10 analysts have raised their earnings estimate for the current fiscal year in the past month. The company is expected to finish the year with $22.73 per share in earnings as compared to $12.96 last year.', 'As a result, there is a strong probability of Nvidia stock heading higher in 2024 thanks to its improved pricing power, which is why it would be a good idea to buy this AI stock right now at 35 times forward earnings, a discount to its five-year average of 39.', ""The Trade Desk stock is up 21% this year, and there is a good chance it could end 2024 with much stronger gains. The company's growth is accelerating due to higher spending on digital advertising as well as the increasing adoption of its programmatic advertising platform."", ""There is robust demand for The Trade Desk's AI-enabled cloud-based platform because it allows marketers to purchase ad inventory, create campaigns, and optimize them using real-time data to drive stronger returns on the ad dollars spent. That led to a 23% year-over-year increase in revenue in the fourth quarter of 2023 to $606 million."", ""The Trade Desk's guidance of $478 million in revenue for the current quarter means that its top line is on track to jump 25% compared to the year-ago period. That would be an improvement over the growth it delivered in the previous quarter."", 'It is not surprising to see why The Trade Desk is witnessing an acceleration in growth. According to the analytical firm eMarketer, programmatic ad spending is expected to grow at three times the pace of nonprogrammatic spending. More specifically, the firm expects programmatic ad spending in the U.S. to increase by almost 16% in 2024, up from 11.4% last year.', 'The reason behind the faster growth in programmatic ad spending is that this method of advertising automates the media buying process with the help of real-time data. Advertisers can bid for ad inventory in real time to keep their costs low and display their ads across different channels depending on where they can improve audience targeting.', 'The Trade Desk, therefore, could end 2024 with stronger revenue growth as compared to the 23% top-line jump it delivered last year to $1.95 billion. Investors looking for a growth stock would do well to buy its shares right now because it seems built for more upside in 2024.', ""Shares of Micron Technology have jumped 39% this year, and the company's latest results suggest that its bull run is just getting started.

Micron, however, posted a surprise profit as its top line jumped 58% year over year.', 'And the $6.6 billion revenue estimate for the current quarter indicates that its top line is on track to increase at a faster pace of 76% from the year-ago quarter.', 'The massive increases in the chipmaker\'s top and bottom lines stem from the improvement in the memory-chip market\'s dynamics. According to Micron, ""the supply-demand balance tightened"" in the memory industry last quarter, driven by strong demand from AI servers and improving conditions in the personal computer (PC) and smartphone markets.', 'And supply reductions by memory manufacturers should ensure that Micron continues to take advantage of a strong pricing environment.', 'In all, the memory industry is expected to generate nearly $130 billion in revenue in 2024, up 45% from last year, according to Statista.', ""As a result, analysts are forecasting a 56% increase in Micron's revenue this year to $24 billion, followed by another jump of 43% in fiscal 2025 to $34.5 billion.

As a result, its revenue increased a massive 58% year over year to $5.8 billion. Micron is anticipating stronger year-over-year growth of 76% in its top line in the current quarter, driven by increased appetite for memory chips from artificial intelligence (AI) servers, smartphones, and personal computers (PCs).', 'The memory industry has witnessed a significant turnaround of late as demand for consumer electronics is back on track, while AI has created the need for advanced memory chips known as high-bandwidth memory (HBM). Micron management remarked on the latest earnings-conference call that its HBM capacity for 2024 is sold out, while the ""overwhelming majority of our 2025 supply has already been allocated.""', ""This is good news for Lam Research (NASDAQ: LRCX), a semiconductor equipment manufacturer that gets a big chunk of its revenue from selling its goods to memory manufacturers such as Micron. Let's look at the reasons why Micron's latest results are an indication that investors would do well to buy Lam Research stock right now."", ""In the most recent quarter, Lam Research got 48% of its revenue from selling semiconductor manufacturing equipment to memory manufacturers. This explains why the company's results in recent quarters have been poor. An oversupply in the memory market forced the likes of Micron and others to put a hold on capacity expansion, and so Lam's top and bottom lines have been heading south."", ""Analysts expect the company to finish the current fiscal year with a 22% decline in revenue to $13.6 billion. Additionally, earnings are expected to drop to $26.76 per share from $34.16. However, as the following chart shows, Lam Research's revenue and earnings could jump sharply in the next fiscal year, which will begin at the end of June 2024."", 'Micron\'s latest results and management commentary tell us just why Lam\'s fortunes are set to turn around. Memory makers will need to increase their supply of HBM to cater to the growing demand from AI servers. The good part is that Lam is already witnessing solid orders for HBM equipment. CEO Tim Archer pointed out on the company\'s January conference call with analysts: ""In 2024, we expect our HBM-related DRAM and packaging shipments to more than triple year on year... ""', ""It is also worth noting that the overall memory market is set to jump big time in 2024. According to Gartner, the memory industry's revenue could jump 66% this year following a 39% drop in 2023. More importantly, the growing adoption of AI is set to drive robust long-term memory demand."", 'According to Micron, AI-enabled PCs are likely to carry 40% to 80% more DRAM (dynamic random access memory) content when compared to traditional PCs. On the other hand, the company expects AI-capable smartphones to ""carry 50% to 100% greater DRAM content compared to non-AI flagship phones today.""', ""Meanwhile, the demand for HBM is forecast to more than double in 2024, generating $14 billion in revenue as compared to $5.5 billion last year. Even better, the HBM market could generate almost $20 billion in revenue next year. All this indicates that memory manufacturers will have to ramp up their production capacities, and a closer look at the industry indicates this is just what's happening."", 'Samsung, for example, is expected to increase HBM production by 2.5 times in 2024, followed by a 2x increase next year. Similarly, SK Hynix expects to increase its capital expenditure this year to support increasing HBM demand. As such, the end-market conditions are set to turn favorable for Lam Research.', ""Lam Research is currently trading at 27 times forward earnings estimates. That's a small discount to the Nasdaq-100's average multiple of 28 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). If Lam Research's earnings hit the $46 estimate, and it were to trade at 28 times earnings, that would put its stock at $1,288, a 33% jump from its current price."", ""However, don't be surprised to see the stock delivering stronger gains as the market may reward it with a higher earnings multiple thanks to its AI-fueled growth, which is why investors should consider buying this semiconductor stock before it jumps higher."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Lam Research right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Lam Research, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Lam Research wasn’t one of them.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. A loss-making company is yet to prove itself with profit, and eventually the inflow of external capital may dry up."", ""In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like McDonald's (NYSE:MCD), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it."", "" Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's "", ""Generally, companies experiencing growth in earnings per share (EPS) should see similar trends in share price. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. It certainly is nice to see that McDonald's has managed to grow EPS by 23% per year over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming."", ""Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. While we note McDonald's achieved similar EBIT margins to last year, revenue grew by a solid 10.0% to US$25b. That's progress."", 'In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time.

While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for McDonald's' future EPS 100% free."", ""Owing to the size of McDonald's, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But thanks to their investment in the company, it's pleasing to see that there are still incentives to align their actions with the shareholders. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$429m. This comes in at 0.2% of shares in the company, which is a fair amount of a business of this size. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves."", ""You can't deny that McDonald's has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. This EPS growth rate is something the company should be proud of, and so it's no surprise that insiders are holding on to a considerable chunk of shares. Fast growth and confident insiders should be enough to warrant further research, so it would seem that it's a good stock to follow. It is worth noting though that we have found 2 warning signs for McDonald's that you need to take into consideration."", ""Although McDonald's certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

Investors looking to add a blue chip to their portfolios might be eyeing this opportunity.', ""Should you buy this top restaurant stock hand over fist and hold through 2024 and beyond? To help us answer that question, let's dive into some valid reasons on both sides of the argument with McDonald's."", ""As a leader in the restaurant industry for several decades, McDonald's has established itself as a dominant force in the fast-food space. And because of this standing, it has developed a wide economic moat that helps it fend off competition."", ""For starters, McDonald's possesses a globally iconic brand. This recognition has allowed the business to occasionally raise menu prices. And that has led to impressive same-store sales gains over the years."", ""The company's focus in recent years to invest heavily in its digital capabilities, in an effort to drive efficiencies and better serve its hungry customers, also helps bolster the brand's presence."", ""With $25.5 billion in 2023 sales and more than 40,000 locations, McDonald's is one of the largest restaurant chains in the world. Consequently, there are very few companies in the industry that have the scale advantages that this business does."", ""Because it can leverage its huge buying power with suppliers, McDonald's can get favorable pricing on food products and other inputs. A chain with far fewer locations doesn't have the ability to do this."", ""Additionally, when McDonald's invests in things like the previously mentioned technological foundation, or in marketing efforts, those dollars have a much higher return given the company's massive store footprint and customer base."", ""This leads to another incredible fact about McDonald's: It's extremely profitable. With only about 5% of stores company-owned, the business operates an asset-light franchise model that rakes in lucrative royalty fees. In the last decade, McDonald's operating margin averaged a stellar 38%."", 'Management uses the copious amounts of free cash flow the business generates to return lots of capital to shareholders. In the last 12 months, $3.1 billion was spent on stock buybacks and $4.5 billion on dividends, both of which boost investor returns.', ""The factors that I just discussed undoubtedly make McDonald's one of the best companies out there. However, that doesn't mean it makes for a smart portfolio addition."", ""My philosophy is that if a stock doesn't have the potential to outperform the S&P 500 index over the next five years, then why take on the risk of owning it? In this case, I believe McDonald's will lag the broader index."", ""One key reason I feel this way is due to the company's muted growth prospects. To be fair, the executive team said that it plans to have 50,000 restaurants open globally by 2027. However, one has to agree that at this point, McDonald's is such a mature and ubiquitous enterprise that revenue growth won't be anything to write home about. "", ""We've seen weaker demand trends more recently, during a time of economic uncertainty when McDonald's should be thriving. Same-store sales were up 4.3% in the U.S. in the fourth quarter, down substantially from a 10.3% bump in Q3. Management pointed to softness with low-income consumers, not an encouraging sign. The aforementioned price increases are a factor in this reduced demand."", ""According to consensus analyst estimates, McDonald's earnings per share are projected to rise at a compound annual rate of 7.4% over the next three years. It's usually a good idea to take these forecasts with a grain of salt, but that doesn't give investors a reason to be excited."", ""For that single-digit income growth expectation, investors are being asked to accept a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 24.2. That valuation is slightly below McDonald's trailing five- and 10-year averages, but it's more expensive than the S&P 500. "", ""Shares have also lagged the popular index since March 2019. The stock's poor track record is another reason that I believe McDonald's should be avoided, particularly for investors who seek to beat the market over the long term."", ""Should you invest $1,000 in McDonald's right now?"", ""Before you buy stock in McDonald's, consider this:"", ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and McDonald's wasn’t one of them.

For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.', ' See our latest analysis for Seagate Technology Holdings ', ""We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years."", ""A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:"", '2024', '2025', '2026', '2027', '2028', '2029', '2030', '2031', '2032', '2033', ' Levered FCF ($, Millions) ', 'US$294.2m', 'US$936.5m', 'US$1.07b', 'US$1.44b', 'US$1.41b', 'US$1.40b', 'US$1.40b', 'US$1.41b', 'US$1.42b', 'US$1.45b', 'Growth Rate Estimate Source', 'Analyst x9', 'Analyst x9', 'Analyst x3', 'Analyst x1', 'Analyst x1', 'Est @ -0.89%', 'Est @ 0.06%', 'Est @ 0.73%', 'Est @ 1.20%', 'Est @ 1.53%', ' Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.8% ', 'US$268', 'US$776', 'US$811', 'US$992', 'US$881', 'US$795', 'US$724', 'US$664', 'US$612', 'US$566', '(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.1b', ""We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period.

The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Seagate Technology Holdings as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.376. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", 'Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.', ' See our latest analysis for Mondelez International ', 'As you can see below, Mondelez International had US$19.1b of debt at December 2023, down from US$22.6b a year prior. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$1.81b, its net debt is less, at about US$17.3b.', 'The latest balance sheet data shows that Mondelez International had liabilities of US$19.0b due within a year, and liabilities of US$24.0b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$1.81b and US$4.51b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$36.7b.', 'Mondelez International has a very large market capitalization of US$94.3b, so it could very likely raise cash to ameliorate its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt.', ""We measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio)."", ""We'd say that Mondelez International's moderate net debt to EBITDA ratio ( being 2.4), indicates prudence when it comes to debt. And its strong interest cover of 11.1 times, makes us even more comfortable. Also relevant is that Mondelez International has grown its EBIT by a very respectable 26% in the last year, thus enhancing its ability to pay down debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Mondelez International's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", 'Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Mondelez International recorded free cash flow worth 62% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.', ""Mondelez International's EBIT growth rate suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its net debt to EBITDA. When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like Mondelez International is pretty sensible with its use of debt. While that brings some risk, it can also enhance returns for shareholders. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example - Mondelez International has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of."", ""If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay."", 'Have feedback on this article?

Warren Buffett has a lot to do with that. His company, Berkshire Hathaway, has been buying shares of the oil giant hand over fist and now owns over a quarter of its outstanding stock. ', ""Another big driver of Occidental Petroleum's popularity is its leading position in the prolific Permian Basin. However, it's not the only oil stock focused on that oil-rich region. Rival Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG) has quietly built up an impressive position in the Permian. That's one of the many reasons investors who are interested in Occidental should check out its regional rival."", 'Occidental Petroleum is the leading oil and gas producer in the prolific Permian. Last year, it produced 584,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE/d) from the region where it holds a massive 2.8 million net acres. That enormous land position gives it a large, untapped resource to grow its production in the future. ', ""The oil giant is working to bolster its already robust position. It agreed to buy privately held CrownRock for $12 billion last year. The deal will add 170,000 BOE/d to its production. Meanwhile, it should boost its free cash flow by $1 billion annually, assuming oil averages $70 a barrel (it's currently over $80). The acquisition will also significantly increase Occidental's acreage position (CrownRock has 94,000 net acres), further extending its growth runway by adding over 1,700 undeveloped locations. "", ""However, the deal adds some additional risk because Occidental is using debt to fund most of the transaction (it's assuming $1.2 billion of CrownRock's debt and issuing $9.1 billion of new debt). That's a concern since its debt-laden acquisition of rival Anadarko Petroleum in 2019 almost bankrupted the company when crude prices crashed the following year. While Occidental plans to quickly repay at least $4.5 billion of that debt within the next year through asset sales and cash flow (and has a very deep-pocketed investor in Warren Buffett), it's a risk to monitor. "", 'Diamondback Energy has a large-scale position in the Permian. It produces 463,000 BOE/d from the region across its 494,000 net acres. It focuses solely on this oil-rich area, whereas Occidental operates across several other areas and has midstream, chemicals, and lower carbon businesses. ', 'Like its rival, Diamondback Energy is working to increase its scale in the region. It agreed to acquire privately held Endeavor Energy Resources in a $26 billion deal. The proposed transaction will create a premier pure-play Permian producer. The combined company will produce 816,000 BOE/d across 838,000 net acres. ', ""Diamondback Energy also expects the transaction will be highly accretive. It anticipates capturing over $550 million in annual cost savings, driving its view that the deal will boost its free cash flow per share by about 10% next year. That significant per-share accretion comes even though Diamondback is issuing significant stock to fund the deal (It's paying about $18 billion in stock and $8 billion in cash) to preserve its financial strength. The company anticipates quickly repaying that debt by reducing its capital return (dividends and share repurchases) target from 75% to 50% of its annual free cash flow. It will use that additional retained cash to repay debt, ensuring it maintains a strong financial foundation after closing the deal. "", 'In commenting on the transformational transaction, CEO Travis Stice stated: ""This is a combination of two strong, established companies merging to create a \'must own\' North American independent oil company. The combined company\'s inventory will have industry-leading depth and quality that will be converted into cash flow with the industry\'s lowest cost structure, creating a differentiated value proposition for our stockholders."" That growing cash flow will enable the company to increase its capital returns once it hits its leverage target. ', ""Occidental Petroleum has caught Warren Buffett's attention in part because of its strong position in the Permian. That region should help fuel its growth in the coming years, especially following the boost it will get by acquiring CrownRock."", ""However, Diamondback Energy has also built a premier position in the Permian, which it's enhancing through its acquisition of Endeavor. It's taking less financial risk to complete that very accretive deal that will further fuel its growth. That makes it a potentially more appealing investment option for those currently contemplating whether they should follow Warren Buffett into Occidental."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Occidental Petroleum wasn’t one of them.

For the general public, the term would belong squarely to the realm of science fiction, and for those in the industry, AI becoming a worldwide phenomenon would appear to be a thing of the distant future.', ""Yet, with the first quarter of 2024 now over, AI is neither exclusively in the realm of science fiction and it is already a global phenomenon. The ball that started to roll with the debut of ChatGPT to the public in late 2022 and early 2024 has now sent chipmaker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s shares soaring by a whopping 518% since the close of 2022. At the same time, dozens of companies claiming to use large language models to help users with their daily lives are now live. They are joined by others that are selling video and image generation software for an industry whose computing needs are thought to sit in billions, if not trillions of dollars."", ""These computing needs are also at the center of a fundamental shakeup in the semiconductor industry. Before we get to that though, it's important to understand what AI really is. In layman's terms, AI is a set of mathematical formulae that seek to generate conclusions to queries or problems based on patterns that have been gleaned through training from an existing data set. The more voluminous and relevant this data set is, the better an AI system is, and voluminous data sets require large amounts of semiconductor chips called AI accelerators and GPUs for their processing."", 'While the software end of AI is quite diverse, the hardware end can prove to be a bigger bottleneck simply due to the nature of chip fabrication. Making chips is neither cheap nor easy, and therefore, only a handful of companies in the world are capable of manufacturing high end semiconductors. In fact, only the American Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), Taiwanese Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), and Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF) are capable of making advanced AI chips. Out of these, only TSMC has been able to rapidly mass produce the latest chips, while Intel is catching up with its technology roadmap and Samsung fails to capture market share to stand its ground with TSMC.', 'This complexity and cost of manufacturing semiconductors is also why we regularly see unbelievable funding estimates for AI. In fact, the latest such bit comes from the The Information in form of a project that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and OpenAI are working on. According to the details, the two plan on building a $100 billion U.S. based artificial intelligence supercomputer. The price tag is unsurprising since a single NVIDIA Blackwell GPU - one of the most advanced artificial intelligence chips in the world - costs between $30,000 to $40,000 according to fresh statements by NVIDIA chief Jensen Huang.', ""Speaking of Mr. Huang, even before the AI fever, he has advocated new technologies through which 'software will end up writing software' regularly during his technology conferences and earnings call reports. Now, with AI a permanent part of investor vocabulary, Huang's vision also appears to be coming to fruition. This is through the well known venture capitalist Peter Thiel backed startup Cognition Labs considering raising funding for a valuation of a whopping $2 billion. Cognition Labs seeks to develop an AI based tool to write code."", ""Finally, before we head to our list of AI stocks that could skyrocket, another major player in the AI race has been the Menlo Park, California based social media firm Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Before AI, Meta was one of the worst performing mega cap stocks on the market as investors remained unconvinced about its foray into the metaverse. However, it's a Wall Street AI darling now, with the shares up 129% over the past 12 months."", ""Here's what\xa0Wedgewood Partners had to say about Meta in its Q4 2023 investor letter:"", ""Meta Platforms was a leading contributor to performance for the quarter – and the year. Core advertising revenue growth accelerated to +23% while operating margin rebounded strongly from a year ago. The Company has been a consistent beneficiary of artificial intelligence (AI) over the past several years, investing aggressively in deep learning recommendation systems that help power its products, which reach nearly half the population of the planet. Meta Platform’s AI investments, combined with its massive scale, allow the Company to quickly spin up new products across its digital advertising real estate to reinforce its competitive positioning. For example, the Company's relatively new Reels product is just over two years old, yet it has driven a +40% increase in the time Instagram users spend on the app. Reels content and other content served up to Instagram users is often driven by several very large and expensive AI recommendation systems that must sort through billions of datapoints in real time and come up with a probability of a user engagement. The Company is one of the few companies that has been able to consistently and profitably monetize AI technologies for shareholders and we continue to hold it has a top position in our portfolios."", 'So, wondering about which AI stocks will skyrocket?

The clinical trial is designed to assess the impact of inaxaplin on kidney function and proteinuria for people living with proteinuric kidney disease mediated by two variants in the APOL1 gene, known as AMKD. In addition, the trial has been expanded to include adolescents with AMKD ages 10 to 17 years.', 'Previously reported Phase 2a proof-of-concept data demonstrated that inaxaplin led to a statistically significant and clinically meaningful mean reduction in the urine protein to creatinine ratio (UPCR) of 47.6% at 13 weeks of treatment compared to baseline, providing the first clinical evidence that an oral small molecule APOL1 inhibitor can decrease proteinuria in people with AMKD.', '""Inaxaplin, a first-in-class molecule that addresses the underlying cause of APOL1-mediated kidney disease, has already shown impressive results in the Phase 2a proof-of-concept study,"" said Carmen Bozic, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer at Vertex.

We have no approved disease-specific therapies for this truly devastating condition, and inaxaplin has the potential to transform the care of AMKD and significantly improve the lives of patients,"" noted Glenn M. Chertow, M.D., M.P.H., Professor of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, and Chair of Vertex’s APOL1 Program Steering Committee. ""The kidney community is strongly encouraged by inaxaplin’s potential, which energizes those of us caring for patients with AMKD.""', 'An Independent Data Monitoring Committee (IDMC) reviewed blinded and unblinded Phase 2 safety and efficacy data from the Phase 2/3 pivotal trial, which evaluated two different doses of inaxaplin compared to placebo for 12 weeks of treatment in patients ages 18 to 65 years and recommended the selection of a single inaxaplin dose of 45 mg once daily in the Phase 3 portion of the Phase 2/3 study. The IDMC also recommended enrolling adolescents with AMKD ages 10 to 17 years in the Phase 3 portion of the study.', 'The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted inaxaplin Rare Pediatric Disease Designation (RPD) and Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) for APOL1-mediated focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS).

The secondary efficacy endpoint is time to composite clinical outcome, which will also be assessed at the final analysis and is defined as a sustained decline of ≥30% from baseline in the eGFR, the onset of end-stage kidney disease or death. The final study analysis will occur when subjects have at least two years of eGFR data and when approximately 187 composite clinical outcomes have occurred.', 'The study is also designed to have a pre-planned interim analysis at Week 48 evaluating eGFR slope, supported by a percent change from baseline in proteinuria in the inaxaplin arm versus placebo.

Approximately 100,000 people in the U.S. and Europe have two APOL1 genetic variants and proteinuric kidney disease. People who inherit two variants in the APOL1 gene have a course of disease that is far more aggressive than in the absence of APOL1 genetic variants. Inherited APOL1 genetic variants may lead to kidney cell injury, cell death and damage to the glomeruli (which filter blood in the kidney). This leads to protein in the urine (known as ""proteinuria"") and decreased ability of the kidney to function, which can lead to dialysis, transplant or death.', 'About Vertex', 'Vertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases. The company has approved medicines that treat the underlying causes of multiple chronic, life-shortening genetic diseases — cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia — and continues to advance clinical and research programs in these diseases.

Creating a similarly prominent group in another sector like healthcare isn\'t an exact science. So, some might not agree with the list below. That said, though, all seven healthcare stocks in my ""Magnificent Seven"" of the industry share the following characteristics. First, they are all leaders in their respective niches.', 'Second, they have soundly outperformed the market over the past decade. Third, they all have solid long-term prospects. With that said, here is my Magnificent Seven of healthcare stocks: Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX), AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG), HCA Healthcare (NYSE: HCA), and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH).', ""It makes sense to group these two pharmaceutical giants. Both are leaders in the diabetes and obesity care markets, where they have been competing for decades. Eli Lilly earned approval last year for Zepbound, an anti-obesity treatment that should go on to generate billions in revenue. Novo Nordisk's competitor in this area, Wegovy, is still growing its sales at an incredible pace. Further, both drugmakers have incredibly deep pipelines."", ""Novo Nordisk is still looking to innovate in the obesity market. It recently reported positive results from a phase 1 study for a promising candidate. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly earned approval for several new products last year. It is awaiting word from U.S. regulators for donanemab, a potential Alzheimer's disease therapy. Eli Lilly also delivered promising phase 1 results for a gene therapy that could treat hearing loss."", 'Both companies should continue delivering excellent financial results and stock market performances. Expect both to be trillion-dollar stocks within a decade.', ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals has been riding the wave of its dominance in the market for therapies that treat a rare disease called cystic fibrosis (CF). Though highly innovative in this area, in which it continues to make headway, the biotech is now looking for diversification. Reducing its exposure to its core therapeutic area isn't a bad idea. Vertex Pharmaceuticals recently earned approval for a gene-editing treatment called Casgevy."", 'It developed this therapy in collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics. Casgevy is a one-time curative therapy for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, two rare blood diseases that have been incredibly difficult to treat or manage. This milestone was a significant breakthrough for Vertex, but more are coming. The drugmaker is inching closer to launching yet another CF medicine and a brand-new therapy for acute pain.', 'Vertex has several key products in its pipeline as well. The biotech looks set to maintain its momentum for a long time.', 'AbbVie became a stand-alone company in January 2013 when it split from Abbott Laboratories. Since then, the drugmaker has been a market-beater, largely thanks to its superstar immunology drug, Humira. The rheumatoid arthritis medicine ran out of patent exclusivity last year, but AbbVie is managing what is one of the most important patent cliffs in the history of the industry (Humira is the best-selling drug ever) pretty well.', ""Though sales have been declining since last year, management expects that to change by 2025. AbbVie's Skyrizi and Rinvoq are Humira's heirs. Finding a duo of medicines that can replace $21.2 billion in annual peak sales is difficult, but Skyrizi and Rinvoq will exceed that total. Management expects them to rack up combined sales of $27 billion by 2027."", ""That speaks volumes about AbbVie's innovative potential, especially in immunology. The company has other promising products and pipeline candidates, and it is a Dividend King. Investors, including income-seekers, can't go wrong with this stock."", ""Intuitive Surgical is the company behind the da Vinci system, a robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) device. The healthcare leader has pioneered the use of RAS machines, which allow surgeons to perform minimally invasive surgeries. Unlike with open surgeries, doctors don't need to make large incisions to access and get a full view of the organs they are operating on. The da Vinci system is equipped with tiny instruments that boast incredible maneuverability."", ""Intuitive Surgical had 8,606 of its da Vinci systems installed as of the end of 2023. As long as demand for these machines grows and the volume of procedures performed with them increases, Intuitive Surgical's revenue and earnings should continue to move in the right direction. Given the aging population and the fact that only 5% of surgeries that could be performed robotically currently are, it looks like Intuitive Surgical has a long runway for growth."", 'UnitedHealth Group and HCA Healthcare are two important players in the U.S. healthcare system. The former is one of the largest health insurers in the country and offers pharmacy management solutions and data and analytics services to other insurers through its subsidiary Optum. HCA Healthcare is one of the largest hospital chains in the country, with facilities that span much of the U.S., although it is particularly concentrated in Florida and Texas. Though both companies saw their businesses disrupted during the worst of the pandemic and suffered somewhat due to economic issues that followed, their operations are resilient.', ""Pandemic-related troubles have mostly subsided. UnitedHealth Group and HCA Healthcare continue to march forward, and both should also benefit from the aging population. UnitedHealth Group's Optum will see a rise in demand for the services it offers as insurance claims rise, while HCA Healthcare's occupancy rates and volume of medical care services will also move in the right direction.

But we have made no commitment that Berkshire will hold any of its marketable securities forever.”', 'But Buffett came close to making that commitment to shareholders in his most recent letter for a handful of companies he finds unparalleled in their industries. He plans to maintain Berkshire’s investments in these businesses “indefinitely,” he says.', 'Here are three stocks Buffett plans to hold forever that still look like great buys today.', 'Buffett first bought shares of Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) for Berkshire Hathaway in 1988 and added to them in 1989. Coca-Cola was one of the companies Buffett was referring to when he originally made his statement about Berkshire’s favorite holding period.', 'One of the biggest factors in Buffett’s investment process is identifying companies with wide economic moats -- a sustainable competitive advantages. A wide moat allows a company to produce strong gross margins. Coca-Cola’s moat stems from its strong brand and the cost-advantages afforded by its scale.', 'The strength of its brand shows up in Coca-Cola’s ability over the past few years to pass on the costs of inflation to customers. The company’s 12% organic revenue growth in 2023 was driven by a 10% increase in pricing and channel mix shift, and above the core inflation rates across most of its markets.', 'Coca-Cola’s global scale is another reason Buffett loves the company. Coca-Cola products are sold around the world, which puts Coke in a position to maximize the efficiency of its supply chain. What’s more, distribution deals for existing products make it easy for the company to introduce new products. As a result, Coca-Cola can increase its already dominant share of the markets in which it participates.', 'While Buffett doesn’t plan on adding to his Coca-Cola position in 2024, the stock still looks attractive at today’s price. Shares trade for a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 21.7, which is roughly in line with the S&P 500. But Buffett would describe the prospects for Coca-Cola as “better than the average American corporation.” Indeed, investors should expect steady revenue growth (even after adjusting for inflation) and continued margin expansion for the foreseeable future.', 'American Express (NYSE: AXP) is another long-time Buffett holding. He built a sizable position in the company for Berkshire’s portfolio during the first half of the 1990s.', 'What makes American Express different from other credit card issuers is that it owns the payment network used by its cards. Bank issuers rely on third-party payment networks to process payments every time someone swipes, dips, taps, or types in their credit card details online. The payment networks take a significant cut for providing their services. But American Express gets to keep that for itself.', ""Nearly 80% of American Express' net revenue comes from payment processing and card fees, although interest on loans is a growing source of revenue. As a result, American Express could see growth slow in an economic downturn that reduces consumer spending, but it won’t see as big an effect from loan defaults as other issuers."", 'Amex sees strong growth in the years to come. Its long-term outlook calls for double-digit percentage revenue growth with earnings growing in the mid-teens. It expects to hit those marks this year with about 10% revenue growth and 15% earnings-per-share (EPS) growth. With the shares trading at a forward P/E ratio of 17.7, the shares look like a great value relative to the growth outlook for the business.', ""The last stock Buffett mentions as one Berkshire plans to hold indefinitely is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). It's a relative newcomer to Berkshire’s portfolio. Buffett established a position in Occidental in 2019 by buying $10 billion worth of preferred shares to fund the oil company’s acquisition of Anadarko. In 2022, he started accumulating shares of the common stock, and Berkshire now owns 28% of the shares outstanding. Buffett has continued adding to Berkshire's position in 2024."", ""Occidental’s position in the Permian Basin gives it a vast amount of oil production capacity at low prices. That said, it’s spent heavily to establish that position, taking on huge amounts of debt, and putting pressure on its balance sheet. To that end, management plans to sell off non-core assets to pay down debt, a playbook it's run throughout its recent history."", 'Since Occidental generates most of its revenue from oil production instead of refining and processing like other integrated oil and gas companies, it’s much more susceptible to swings in oil prices. Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub, for whom Buffett has expressed much admiration, is extremely bullish on the price of oil. So far, her bets have worked out well, with West Texas Crude future prices climbing 18% through the first three months of the year.', 'That also makes Occidental a bit riskier than other oil and gas companies. But with the shares trading at a forward P/E ratio of 17.9 and an enterprise value-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) ratio of 6, the shares are trading at a fair value. If Hollub’s thesis on oil prices plays out over the next couple of years, it could turn out to be a great value.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

Investors usually have to choose between one or the other of these attractive characteristics. But that might not be the case facing Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) investors right now."", ""The beverage giant dominates its global industry and yet its yield is sitting close to a post-pandemic high thanks to the combination of a rising payout and the stock's weak performance in 2023."", ""Sure, it's generally true that higher yields often come with some compromises, either around growth prospects or earnings potential. With that risk in mind, let's look at the main reasons why Coke pays more than peers like PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), and whether income investors should still like the stock today."", ""Dividend growth is ultimately funded by sales growth and cash flow, and both metrics are slowing down in Coca-Cola's case. Organic sales growth landed at a bubbly 12% in fiscal 2023, but almost all that improvement came from rising prices. Volume rose just 2% for the year."", ""Price hikes in 2024 won't provide nearly the same lift that they have in the past few quarters. That's mainly because inflation has slowed, but also partly because consumers are becoming more price sensitive. Coke is also facing a slower consumer spending environment. As a result, management forecast that sales growth will be cut roughly in half in 2024, down to a range of about 6% to 7%."", ""The short-term outlook is weak when it comes to cash flow as well. Coke is expecting to generate $9.2 billion of free cash in 2024 to mark a 5% decline following last year's 2% uptick. The dividend can easily continue climbing through such a drop. Yet investors should brace for more modest dividend increases ahead in the next year or so."", ""Investors are being compensated well for taking on these elevated risks around Coke's short-term financial trends. The stock is valued at 5.7 times sales compared to its pandemic high of closer to 7 times sales. Its dividend yield is 3.1% as of this writing, compared to the 2.9% you'd get from owning Pepsi or the 2.7% rate available from Keurig Dr Pepper shares."", ""Owning $5,000 of Coke's shares would deliver roughly $150 of passive income in year one. The company has raised its payout in each of the last 61 years as well, so you can feel highly confident that the dividend will keep rising over the coming decade even if sales trends remain muted."", ""If you're looking for head-turning growth, then Coca-Cola stock might not be for you. Peer PepsiCo warned investors last month that consumer spending trends were slowing down to the pre-pandemic normal and that this shift is combining with falling inflation to pressure sales for the foreseeable future. Coke is facing many of the same challenges, and that helps explain why the stock underperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the last year. Most Wall Street pros are expecting sales to be flat this year before rising by about 5% in 2025."", ""Coke can do a lot with even modest sales growth, though, especially given that its operating profit margin is 28% of sales, or about twice PepsiCo's rate. Patient investors can get exposure to that industry-leading financial strength at a discount today while they wait for demand trends to rebound. In the meantime, consider electing to have Coke's quarterly dividend payments automatically reinvest into more shares, amplifying your returns over the long term."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our coverage of the latest happenings surrounding one of America's most widely followed stock indexes, then you can take a look at the 5 Best S&P 500 Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\xa0"", 'The S&P 500 has had a great year so far. The flagship stock index, which was quite jittery a little over a year back, has been doing well as of late. This performance comes after the tail end of 2022 which saw analysts and investors all around worried about a recession in the U.S. due to high interest rates. However, 2023 came with a multitude of surprises in the form of artificial intelligence, falling inflation, and a growing economy - all of which ended up putting the bears to rest.', ""So how great has the first quarter of 2024 been for the S&P 500? Well, for starters, the index has set a new record this year. In fact, while the index has been regularly setting records in 2024, its latest record came just before the Easter holiday long weekend. This saw the S&P 500 set a new closing record of 5,245 - ensuring that the index comfortably remains above the coveted benchmark of 5,000 points that most folks would have thought was impossible at the close of 2022 and in an era marked by 'expensive' and difficult to get cash due to high interest rates."", 'The next question to ask is, why is the S&P 500 setting new records? After all, despite the ongoing euphoria surrounding artificial intelligence, the close of Q1 2024 has also seen investors re calibrate their expectations for the Federal Reserve potentially reducing the bank rate. These expectations have shifted for the worse, with most folks now expecting the rate cuts to start later than originally expected.', ""Well, several macroeconomic data points have led to the S&P setting new records. For instance, investors were dealt with a nice surprise in the form of an upward GDP growth revision for Q4 2023 which saw the new estimate grow to sit at 3.4% from an earlier 3.2%. Additionally, even though the commercial real estate sector continues to feel the pinch from a massive shakeup in the bond market and the interest rate environment, home sales in America grew by 1.6% in February to outpace estimates of a 1.5% growth. Another data point that is yet to be reflected in the S&P 500 is the Fed's preferred inflation indication, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index. The latest data shows that as of February 2024, inflation in the U.S. stood at 2.5% - meeting forecasts and being more in tune with the Fed's preferred 2% reading."", ""Digging deeper, some of the stocks that have fueled the S&P 500's 11% year to date gains are Super Micro Computer, Inc. (NASDAQ:SMCI), Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG), and of course, Wall Street's A.I. darling, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). The three stocks are up 254%, 60%, and 88% year to date, and the fact that two out of three of the S&P 500's best performing stocks in the first quarter of 2024 are technology companies shows how artificial intelligence has fundamentally shifted stock market valuations. While everyone knows that it's NVIDIA's high end GPUs that have injected steroids into its share price, for Super Micro and Constellation Energy, the catalysts were a second quarter earnings beat and guidance raise for the former and a 2024 forecast beat for the latter."", ""When it comes to investing, while the retail camp is often left reacting to the news, hedge funds spend countless hours and vast sums of money picking out the right set of stocks. As the first quarter of 2024 comes to a close, let's see what the hedge funds were saying about NVIDIA in the fourth quarter of 2023."", ""An excerpt from Polen Capital's investor letter for the period is as follows:"", 'NVIDIA shares rocketed higher by well over 200% in 2023 although they slightly underperformed our Portfolio and the Russell 1000 Growth in the fourth quarter. Generative AI has been a huge boon for NVIDIA as the use of LLMs like ChatGPT and others requires tremendous processing power that, today, is mostly provided by NVIDIA’s GPUs. All large cloud service providers, AI factories, and many large consumer internet companies are laying the foundation for generative AI by deploying NVIDIA GPUs and other parallel processing chips to be able to do large scale generative AI either for internal use (i.e., Meta) or as a service for others (i.e., AI factories) or both (cloud service providers such as Amazon, Microsoft, and Google).', 'Given many of NVIDIA’s customers or its end customers are still very much in the experimentation phase with generative AI, it is unclear how sustainable the current demand for GPUs truly is. At the same time, it is known that NVIDIA has historically been highly cyclical. By the end of 2024, we believe NVIDIA will already account for roughly half the market for datacenter chips, servers, and networking equipment, which is unprecedented. Even though the valuation at 25x forward earnings doesn’t look very demanding at first glance, it assumes NVIDIA will own virtually the entire datacenter chip market in just the next few years and will sustain year-on-year growth despite being a cyclical business that is currently experiencing much higher new peak.', ""With these details in mind, let's take a look at which S&P 500 stocks analysts can't stop talking about.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We can see that Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", ""Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for Waste Management ', 'The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at December 2023 Waste Management had debt of US$15.9b, up from US$14.7b in one year. However, it does have US$458.0m in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$15.4b.', 'The latest balance sheet data shows that Waste Management had liabilities of US$4.23b due within a year, and liabilities of US$21.7b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$458.0m and US$2.87b worth of receivables due within a year. So it has liabilities totalling US$22.6b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.', ""This deficit isn't so bad because Waste Management is worth a massive US$85.6b, and thus could probably raise enough capital to shore up its balance sheet, if the need arose. However, it is still worthwhile taking a close look at its ability to pay off debt."", ""In order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses."", ""With net debt to EBITDA of 2.6 Waste Management has a fairly noticeable amount of debt. But the high interest coverage of 7.6 suggests it can easily service that debt. If Waste Management can keep growing EBIT at last year's rate of 12% over the last year, then it will find its debt load easier to manage. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Waste Management can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. During the last three years, Waste Management produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 61% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to."", ""We feel that Waste Management's solid conversion of EBIT to free cash flow was really heart warming, like a mid-winter fair trade hot chocolate in a tasteful alpine chalet. But we are a little concerned by its net debt to EBITDA. Looking at all the aforementioned factors together, it strikes us that Waste Management can handle its debt fairly comfortably. On the plus side, this leverage can boost shareholder returns, but the potential downside is more risk of loss, so it's worth monitoring the balance sheet. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. Case in point: We've spotted   2 warning signs for Waste Management  you should be aware of."", ""If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet."", 'Have feedback on this article?

If you share my opinion, the outlook remains positive for energy prices, and the U.S. housing market will recover in time. Devon Energy (NYSE: DVN) and Whirlpool (NYSE: WHR) are great buys right now. However, despite being an exciting investing proposition in its own right, 3M (NYSE: MMM) is not the stock high-yield investors should be buying. Here's why."", 'Devon Energy pays a fixed-plus-variable dividend, using the remaining free cash flow after the fixed dividend (currently $0.22 a quarter) is paid and share buybacks are completed.', ""It's a flexible strategy. When management feels its stock is undervalued, it prioritizes share buybacks. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2023, management retired 5.2 million shares for $234 million, paid a fixed dividend of $0.20 per share for $127 million, and paid a variable dividend of $0.22 per share using $140 million."", 'The chart below shows Devon has a pretty good track record of reducing its share count. High-yield investors should welcome this as it increases the share of their claim on future cash flows from Devon Energy.', 'Devon also has a good track record of growing resources, not least through extensions and discoveries.', ""By my calculations, based on a price of oil of $80 per barrel in management's 2024 projections and the current share price of $48.37, Devon's free-cash-flow (FCF) yield could be almost 10% in 2024. Given that management is targeting to return 70% of FCF to investors in 2024, there should be ample room to pay a hefty dividend as well as buying back shares to enhance the dividend per share in the future."", ""While it's not clear what the variable dividend will be in 2024, at the current price of oil, Devon has plenty of potential to pay a substantial dividend this year."", ""It won't be a vintage year for Whirlpool in terms of its headline numbers. Over an extended period, relatively high interest rates are slowing the housing market and putting pressure on household appliance sales. Given that existing home sales drive 25% of U.S. demand for appliances, and 15% comes from new home sales, it's no surprise to learn that Whirlpool expects its 2024 comparable sales to be flat with 2023 at $16.9 billion, with its earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin also flat for 2023 at 6.8%."", ""There's very little Whirlpool can do about its end markets, but it can change where it focuses on operating. That's exactly what management is doing by agreeing to transfer its major European domestic appliances business to Arcelik's European business while obtaining a 25% stake in the new company. It's a good move, as Whirlpool's European business has bled cash in eight of the last 15 years and had an EBIT margin of just 1.8% in 2023."", ""As such, Whirlpool will focus more on its core North American market, which is on track to generate a 9% EBIT margin in 2024. In addition, management's cost-cutting measures took $800 million out of costs in 2023, and it plans to take $300 million to $400 million out in 2024. These actions should set Whirlpool up nicely to benefit from a lower interest rate in North America in the future."", ""There is a value case for buying 3M stock, not least as management's restructuring actions hopefully turn around its lackluster margin performance in recent years. In addition, there are some signs of improvement in some of its key end markets, such as consumer electronics, semiconductors, and electronics."", 'That said, the spinoff of its healthcare business, Solventum, will take away a valuable source of reliable cash flows. Moreover, 3M continues to face significant legal costs as it deals with litigation issues and will have multibillion-dollar annual cash calls from legal settlements.', ""On the other hand, 3M will receive $7.7 billion in proceeds from the Solventum spinoff and will retain a 19.9% stake in the healthcare business, which it can sell off to raise cash. The bottom line is that 3M can maintain its dividend at the current level, but using cash to restructure an ailing company might not be the best use of shareholders' money."", 'Finally, 3M\'s current CEO, Michael Roman (who will become executive chairman on May 1), has fallen short of explicitly confirming the dividend will be maintained at the current level after the Solventum spinoff, but has promised ""an attractive dividend.""', ""Therefore, don't be surprised if 3M cuts its dividend in 2024."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in 3M right now?', 'Before you buy stock in 3M, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and 3M wasn’t one of them.

Creating a similarly prominent group in another sector like healthcare isn\'t an exact science. So, some might not agree with the list below. That said, though, all seven healthcare stocks in my ""Magnificent Seven"" of the industry share the following characteristics. First, they are all leaders in their respective niches.', 'Second, they have soundly outperformed the market over the past decade. Third, they all have solid long-term prospects. With that said, here is my Magnificent Seven of healthcare stocks: Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX), AbbVie (NYSE: ABBV), Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ: ISRG), HCA Healthcare (NYSE: HCA), and UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH).', ""It makes sense to group these two pharmaceutical giants. Both are leaders in the diabetes and obesity care markets, where they have been competing for decades. Eli Lilly earned approval last year for Zepbound, an anti-obesity treatment that should go on to generate billions in revenue. Novo Nordisk's competitor in this area, Wegovy, is still growing its sales at an incredible pace. Further, both drugmakers have incredibly deep pipelines."", ""Novo Nordisk is still looking to innovate in the obesity market. It recently reported positive results from a phase 1 study for a promising candidate. Meanwhile, Eli Lilly earned approval for several new products last year. It is awaiting word from U.S. regulators for donanemab, a potential Alzheimer's disease therapy. Eli Lilly also delivered promising phase 1 results for a gene therapy that could treat hearing loss."", 'Both companies should continue delivering excellent financial results and stock market performances. Expect both to be trillion-dollar stocks within a decade.', ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals has been riding the wave of its dominance in the market for therapies that treat a rare disease called cystic fibrosis (CF). Though highly innovative in this area, in which it continues to make headway, the biotech is now looking for diversification. Reducing its exposure to its core therapeutic area isn't a bad idea. Vertex Pharmaceuticals recently earned approval for a gene-editing treatment called Casgevy."", 'It developed this therapy in collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics. Casgevy is a one-time curative therapy for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia, two rare blood diseases that have been incredibly difficult to treat or manage. This milestone was a significant breakthrough for Vertex, but more are coming. The drugmaker is inching closer to launching yet another CF medicine and a brand-new therapy for acute pain.', 'Vertex has several key products in its pipeline as well. The biotech looks set to maintain its momentum for a long time.', 'AbbVie became a stand-alone company in January 2013 when it split from Abbott Laboratories. Since then, the drugmaker has been a market-beater, largely thanks to its superstar immunology drug, Humira. The rheumatoid arthritis medicine ran out of patent exclusivity last year, but AbbVie is managing what is one of the most important patent cliffs in the history of the industry (Humira is the best-selling drug ever) pretty well.', ""Though sales have been declining since last year, management expects that to change by 2025. AbbVie's Skyrizi and Rinvoq are Humira's heirs. Finding a duo of medicines that can replace $21.2 billion in annual peak sales is difficult, but Skyrizi and Rinvoq will exceed that total. Management expects them to rack up combined sales of $27 billion by 2027."", ""That speaks volumes about AbbVie's innovative potential, especially in immunology. The company has other promising products and pipeline candidates, and it is a Dividend King. Investors, including income-seekers, can't go wrong with this stock."", ""Intuitive Surgical is the company behind the da Vinci system, a robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) device. The healthcare leader has pioneered the use of RAS machines, which allow surgeons to perform minimally invasive surgeries. Unlike with open surgeries, doctors don't need to make large incisions to access and get a full view of the organs they are operating on. The da Vinci system is equipped with tiny instruments that boast incredible maneuverability."", ""Intuitive Surgical had 8,606 of its da Vinci systems installed as of the end of 2023. As long as demand for these machines grows and the volume of procedures performed with them increases, Intuitive Surgical's revenue and earnings should continue to move in the right direction. Given the aging population and the fact that only 5% of surgeries that could be performed robotically currently are, it looks like Intuitive Surgical has a long runway for growth."", 'UnitedHealth Group and HCA Healthcare are two important players in the U.S. healthcare system. The former is one of the largest health insurers in the country and offers pharmacy management solutions and data and analytics services to other insurers through its subsidiary Optum. HCA Healthcare is one of the largest hospital chains in the country, with facilities that span much of the U.S., although it is particularly concentrated in Florida and Texas. Though both companies saw their businesses disrupted during the worst of the pandemic and suffered somewhat due to economic issues that followed, their operations are resilient.', ""Pandemic-related troubles have mostly subsided. UnitedHealth Group and HCA Healthcare continue to march forward, and both should also benefit from the aging population. UnitedHealth Group's Optum will see a rise in demand for the services it offers as insurance claims rise, while HCA Healthcare's occupancy rates and volume of medical care services will also move in the right direction. In short, both stocks have plenty of growth fuel left in their tanks."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Eli Lilly wasn’t one of them.

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you may go to 5 Cheapest Places to Retire Abroad on $1,000 per Month. ', 'Retiring in the United States of America is no longer the dream it once used to be. As of today, the US ranks amongst one of the most expensive countries to live in 2024, implying how financially challenging it can be for the average retiree to live in the country. This is particularly true for those on fixed incomes. Figures from the Social Security Administration highlight that as of January 2024, the average Social Security payment stood at just $1,909 per month. This amount falls significantly short of the $4,345 that the average retiree typically spends, as revealed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Although the 3.2% COLA adjustment may imply some measure of relief, regrettably, it has had minimal impact on alleviating the skyrocketing expenses associated with items like healthcare for retirees. Factor in the shattering retirement confidence that recent reports from BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) have revealed, and the retirement landscape in the US doesn’t seem as promising as it once used to be.', 'According to BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) reports, respondents believe that retirement is not the time to “live it up”. Rather, it is the time to feel “financially secure”. Having conducted this research jointly with the Employee Benefit Research Institute, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) reveals that across all wealth levels on average, most “current” retirees still had 80% of their pre-retirement savings even after almost two decades of being retired. One-third were found having grown their assets instead. Even though these statistics may seem like good news, the reality may paint a stark contrast. The truth is, many retirees may not be spending down their assets due to the uncertain retirement landscape that the country paints. Many may even believe on “hoarding” on these very assets in an attempt to enjoy the same lifestyle they did so before retirement.', 'Coming back to how the United States is increasingly becoming expensive to live in, a recent Consumer Expenditure Survey from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reveals that average monthly expenses for American households have risen to $6,081, amounting to $72,967 annually. This figure represents a notable increase from the $5,557 monthly expenditure recorded in 2022. In particular, expenses for seniors aged 65 and above amount to $57,818 annually. Out of this average annual expenditure, food and housing are the biggest expenses of retirees. Housing takes up an estimated 35% of average annual expenditures, while food accounts for an estimated average annual spending of $7,306. When considering additional expenses like transportation, healthcare, and maintenance, the list of financial obligations can seem never-ending. This is particularly daunting when juxtaposed with the average Social Security amount, which we have discussed early on.', 'These figures also highlight the ongoing struggle presented by high costs of living, which greatly affects the financial situation of residents nationwide, particularly those with fixed incomes.\xa0 Talking specifically about retirees, the median retirement savings for boomers stand at $202,000, as noted by TransAmerica Center for Retirement Studies. Moreover, a recent survey by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) reveals that Americans now believe they need an estimated $1.8 million to retire anyway. Comparing the median savings to this figure, it is safe to say that retirees with minimal savings are in for quite a difficult time in retirement. Their retirement savings may not be sufficient to cover expenses for retirees.', ""Further compounding the challenges of retirement planning is the healthcare landscape of the country. Factors like soaring healthcare costs and disparities in coverage are increasingly provoking retirees to question whether retirement in the USA is still a wise decision. The private healthcare insurance sector, as seen to be dominated by companies like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Elevance Health, Inc. (NYSE:ELV), and The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), are seen to report substantial profits, while customers bear the brunt of industry's prioritization of profits over patient well-being."", 'In 2023, internal documents from STAT showed that UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) used some secret rules that helped them restrict access to rehabilitation care that was requested from them by specific groups of patients that were seriously ill. This restriction included those who lived in nursing homes or suffered from cognitive impairment. In another instance, internal records from The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) that were scrutinized by ProPublica and The Capitol Forum revealed that the company had been accruing substantial savings by denying claims based on medical reasons. Allegedly, The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) doctors are neglecting to review patient files, as outlined in the report. Due to factors such as these, corporations like UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) and The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) thrive, even as seniors suffer the consequences.', 'Retiring abroad, in contrast, is increasingly painting a compelling picture for retirees. Furthermore, data from sources like the Social Security Administration indicate a significant rise in the number of Americans receiving their benefits from overseas, reflecting the growing trend of retirees exploring international retirement options for reasons that extend beyond finances. For those whose average check is a mere $1,909 a month, or even lower considering this is only the average amount, it pays to know affordable retirement communities outside the country. There are many cheapest countries for retirement that will offer retirees such communities to explore, with many boasting a cost of living that is even lower than $1,000 on average. Living in these places doesn’t only prove cost-effective, but also a breeze considering that many of them are some of the easiest countries to retire to.', 'Stefano Ember/Shutterstock.com', 'To compile the list of cheapest places to retire abroad on $1,000 per month, we sifted through our lists of places to retire on $1,000 a month, cheapest warm places to retire around the world, best places to retire around the world for US Citizens, cheapest places to retire in Europe, best places to retire in the world on Social Security, and awesome places to retire on $3,000 or less, to name a few.

According to Pew Research Center's analysis, approximately 18% of parents in 2021 didn't engage in paid employment which is quite consistent with the levels observed in 2016. However, the distribution between stay-at-home mothers and fathers is disparate as 26% of mothers and 7% of fathers assume this role.\xa0"", 'Over a three-decade span from 1989 to 2021, the dynamics of stay-at-home parenting have also evolved, particularly concerning fathers. The proportion of stay-at-home dads has increased, comprising 18% of such parents in 2021. Reasons for not working outside the home may vary between genders. For example, a majority of stay-at-home moms attribute this preference owing to their caregiving responsibilities, while dads mention a broader array of factors such as illness, disability, retirement, inability to find work, or educational pursuits.', ""Demographically, stay-at-home dads differ largely from their working counterparts. They are less likely to hold a bachelor's degree and are more economically disadvantaged, with 40% living in poverty compared to 5% of working fathers. Moreover, stay-at-home dads tend to be older and more racially diverse than dads engaged in paid employment.\xa0"", ""Moroever, research indicates that the decision to become a stay-at-home parent involves weighing different factors. While 60% of Americans believe a child benefits from having at least one parent at home, the choice presents both advantages and disadvantages. Pros can be increased involvement in a child's life, better academic performance, and greater control over upbringing. Conversely, cons can inlcude potential career setbacks, loss of income, and adverse impacts on mental and physical health."", 'Studies show that stay-at-home parents may experience increased levels of sadness, depression, and isolation compared to working parents.

Out of roughly 6,000 stocks listed on the NYSE and NASDAQ, only 67 companies have the privilege of being called dividend aristocrats. They are a select group of companies that have raised their dividend payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. These stocks belong to the S&P 500 and are represented through the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrat Index. Due to their consistent dividend growth over the years, which mainly reflects their strong financial position, dividend aristocrats are highly favored by investors. In addition to this, these stocks have shown strong performance over the years, surpassing other asset classes. Since the index’s inception in 2005 through September 2023, the dividend aristocrats index delivered a total return of 10.35%, outperforming the broader market, which delivered a 9.54% return during this period.', 'While dividend aristocrats are mainly known for their dividend growth and stable equity gains, it is important to acknowledge that they showed lower volatility levels in achieving these returns. In one of our articles on the subject, we reported that from 2005 to September 2023, dividend aristocrats showed low volatility levels of 15.35%, compared with a slightly higher volatility rate of 16.31% for the S&P 500. This shows that these stocks do not experience regular fluctuations in their price movements and are comparatively resilient. By consistently raising their dividends for 25 consecutive years or more, these companies have shown the ability to reward shareholders with growing dividends during challenging periods, such as the financial crisis of 2007 and the pandemic of 2020.', 'From December 1989 to July 2023, the dividend aristocrats index performed better than the broader market 69.34% of the time during down markets, and 43.61% of the time when the market was up. This is to be noted that the dividend aristocrats index was launched in 2005 and all the data prior to that is back-tested hypothetical research. In addition to their performance in both bullish and bearish markets, dividend aristocrats outperformed the S&P 500 52.3% of the time during this timeframe.', 'Though investors tend to focus on only one aspect of dividend investing, be it dividend growth or dividend yield, research has shown that both these strategies can coexist.

I suspect some large biopharma companies agree.', ""Neha Chamaria (Brookfield Renewable): India was recently in the news when one of its largest conglomerates operationalized a capacity of 1 gigawatt (GW) at a renewable energy plant. The thing is, it isn't just another clean energy plant: It is the world's largest renewable energy project with a targeted operational capacity of 45 GW by 2030. India, after all, wants to meet 50% of all its electric power needs from renewable energy sources by 2030."", ""That's a big goal, and India isn't the only nation switching to cleaner energy sources. That also means massive opportunities ahead for renewable energy companies, one of which is Brookfield Renewable, with operations across 20 countries. With units of Brookfield Renewable Partners and shares of the corporate entity, Brookfield Renewable Corp. down about 12% and 15%, respectively, in the past three months, it's an opportunity to buy the renewable energy stock."", ""There's a lot to like about Brookfield Renewable. It has a diversified portfolio with large-scale operations across hydropower, wind, solar, and energy storage. It expects to invest at least $7 billion in growth projects over the next five years. Brookfield Renewable already generates most of its cash flows under long-term power contracts. So, while that offers cash-flow stability, growth investments should drive higher cash flows. Between 2023 and 2028, the company is confident of growing its funds from operations (FFO) per share by at least 10% annually, which should provide enough buffer for it to grow dividends by 5% to 9% every year."", ""So what you have here is a company operating in a high-potential industry, maintaining a strong balance sheet, growing its cash flows steadily, and rewarding shareholders with bigger dividends year after year. Earlier this year, Brookfield Renewable reported record numbers for 2023 and raised its dividend by 5%, setting itself up for another strong year ahead. With both share classes of Brookfield Renewable losing some ground in recent months primarily because of high interest rates and their dividends now yielding at least 5.8% each, I don't think you'll regret buying some shares this April for the long haul."", 'Daniel Foelber (UPS): United Postal Service stock was staging a bit of a comeback, but it all went downhill after the company hosted its 2024 Investor and Analyst Day on March 26. UPS ripped off the proverbial bandage, calling for weak 2024 results and high costs. Margin growth is expected to pick up in 2025, with 2026 ultimately being a record year with $108 billion to $114 billion in revenue and a 13% adjusted operating margin. But the path to get there -- and how long it will take -- led many investors to run for the exits.', 'UPS is a somewhat boring stock that got caught up in the pandemic-fueled growth narrative. When folks were stuck at home, spending on services and experiences plummeted, and goods spending soared. Demand outpaced package-delivery supply, which helped fuel top- and bottom-line growth.', 'As you can see in the chart, the revenue growth did not prove sticky. UPS managed to put up pretty good overall results in 2022 but was too optimistic for 2023. It initially guided for $97 billion to $99.4 billion in revenue and a consolidated operating margin of 12.8% to 13.6%. The results proved to be a huge miss, with revenue of just $91 billion and a 10.1% operating margin.', ""It's understandable why investors are selling off UPS stock. The company went from outperforming to underperforming, and its guidance isn't that good. Given its recent track record, some may question whether UPS can hit its 2026 guidance. But UPS management took great care to walk through the reasons why its guidance is achievable, and the logic checks out."", 'UPS has sold off enough and has a clear path to return to growth. The long-term tailwinds of e-commerce and the package-delivery industry, both domestically and internationally, are strong. With a 4.5% dividend yield, investors get a sizable incentive to hold the stock through this challenging period.', ""Demitri Kalogeropoulos (Procter & Gamble): Consumer staples companies have fallen out of favor on Wall Street lately, and that's a great reason to take a look at Procter & Gamble in April. This month is a big one for shareholders, with two huge announcements on the way. P&G's fiscal third-quarter update will arrive on April 19, and the company will reveal its 2024 dividend payout around the same time. Last April, the dividend increase of 3% was announced a few days before P&G's quarterly report."", ""There's a good chance that investors will see a bigger dividend increase for 2024. Sure, P&G's sales trends are slowing, as they have been for most industry rivals. Shoppers haven't been spending as freely on consumer staples, and price hikes are slowing along with inflation."", ""But P&G's profitability is rising, cash flow is stellar, and its earnings are spiking. The owner of hit brands like Tide detergent and Pampers diapers posted a 16% profit boost in the most recent quarter."", ""Keep an eye on volume trends in April's earnings report. P&G needs this figure to stay in positive territory, especially now that price increases have slowed. I'd expect the company to continue winning market share against peers like Kimberly-Clark, as it has over the past several quarters. I'm also looking for its operating margin to stay in its industry-leading territory."", ""In any case, P&G is highly likely to announce its 68th consecutive annual dividend hike in April. That type of streak is rare in the stock market, and it's a direct result of impressive competitive assets like P&G's big global sales footprint and highly efficient operations. Investors who don't mind a period of sluggish sales growth ahead should consider putting this Dividend King on their watchlists for April and beyond."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Toast right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Toast, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Toast wasn’t one of them.

If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the fluoridation history and how it’s important today, you can go directly to the top 8 States with the Most Fluoridated Water in the US.\xa0', ""Fluoride, nicknamed nature's cavity fighter, is a naturally occurring mineral released by rocks and found in soil, water, and air. In the US, nearly 73% of Americans receive water from community water systems with adjusted levels of fluoride, which helps protect their teeth from decay. The process of adjusting fluoride in the water levels such that it does no harm and instead protects the teeth, is known as water fluoridation."", 'Although the timeline for Community Water Fluoridation dates all the way back to 1901, it wasn’t until the 1930s that significant progress on the subject was made. In 1930, a chemist at Aluminum Company of America — now known as the Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) — used new technology to analyze water from an abandoned water well and found that it contained a concentration of fluoride many times higher than normal. The chemist, H. V. Churchill, was the chief chemist at Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) and had spent the past few years fighting claims that aluminum cookware was poisonous. The reason he looked into the water from this abandoned well was primarily that he did not want Alcoa’s reputation to be damaged further.\xa0 ', ""Spoiler: Churchill did in fact succeed in saving the company's reputation. Today, almost a century later, Alcoa Corp is still an industry leader. It is one of the largest producers of aluminum, and one of the world's largest bauxite miners too. In February 2024, the company made an offer to acquire the leading Australian mining corporation, Alumina Limited, in a\xa0 $2.2 billion deal. In March 2024, this deal was finalized, and Alumina shareholders now have an ownership stake of 31.25% in the combined venture. Prior to this acquisition though, both companies already had a joint venture, Alcoa World Alumina and Chemicals (AWAC), that had been operating for decades."", 'Now, coming back to the history of fluoridation, it’s important to have a bit more context as to how Alcoa Corp (NYSE:AA) was linked to the ordeal, and why an abandoned water well mattered so much in this entire timeline. ', 'At the time when all these events were unfolding, an increasingly significant number of the population in the United States, comprising both adults and children, was affected by the mottled enamel “disease.” The research on this, and fluoride, started back in 1901. However, in the years that preceded 1930, significant progress was made by Dr. McKay and Dr. Grover Kempf of the United States Public Health Service (PHS), when they traveled to Bauxite, Arkansas. Bauxite was a company town owned by ALCOA, and both the doctors had traveled here to investigate reports of the mottled enamel cases.\xa0', ""They soon found that the disease was common among the children in this town, but was absent in the children living in another town only five miles away. Dr. McKay and Dr. Kempf then analyzed the water supply, and although they found no clue if the water supply was causing this mottled enamel issue, they still published their findings. As a result of this publication, the community’s water well was abandoned, and ALCOA's reputation was put in danger. "", 'Concerned, Churchill investigated the matter himself and soon found that it was the presence of fluoride in the community’s water supply that needed further investigation. From hereon, the journey was sped up. After some research, Churchill found out that the water supply in the town had fluorides in it, and contacted Dr. McKay to collaborate and look into this matter alongside him.', 'Within a year, in 1931, mottled enamel was renamed dental fluorosis, and it was concluded that the condition was caused by high levels of fluorides in the water. By 1945, the scientist who renamed mottled enamel,\xa0 Dr. H. Trendley Dean, head of the Dental Hygiene Unit at the National Institute of Health (NIH), hypothesized that fluoride may help fight tooth decay if added to drinking water in a controlled quantity.\xa0', 'Following his hypothesis, in the same year, the city of Grand Rapids in the state of Michigan became the first city to add fluoride to its city water system, and the rest is history. ', 'Now, community water fluoridation is a practice throughout the United States, alongside many other countries.\xa0', 'A study by the American Public Health Association in 2011 found that children with dental caries (tooth decay) were more likely to skip school due to dental pain than children with good oral health. Another study by the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR) claimed that dental caries is one of the most common chronic diseases in America and one of the biggest threats to oral health. Despite this, children from low-income families are unable to access proper dental care due to the high costs. Consequently, tooth decay is more common among these children.\xa0 ', 'To address this concern, the United States has been working to make its fluoridated water accessible to all. By 2030, the country aims to provide at least 77% of Americans with fluoridated water. If successful, this initiative can help save tonnes of money on both ends and help thousands of individuals continue to function as productive extensions of society without succumbing to the growing pains of tooth decay.\xa0', 'Aside from government-level efforts to make oral health accessible to all, there are also some notable companies like Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC) and Procter & Gamble Co’s (NYSE:PG) working in the same domain, albeit through different initiatives.\xa0', ""Henry Schein, Inc. (NASDAQ:HSIC) aims to make healthcare, especially oral healthcare, accessible to all through its Global Product Donation program. Under this program, Henry Schein provides an array of healthcare products to community medical or dental organizations. However, organizations must apply and get selected to receive this donation from the company. With a market cap of $9.70 billion, Henry Schein is a leading American distributor of healthcare products and services, operating in 32 countries worldwide. In 2023, the company's total net sales stood at $12.3 billion, and it expects to see a total sales growth of around 8% to 12% in 2024. According to Henry Schein, its compound annual growth rate has been about 11.5% since 1995."", ""On the other hand, Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG)’s oral health subsidiary company, Crest (subsidiary company), has a program named the “12 Days of Crest Smiles.” This is a holiday initiative, and through this program, Procter & Gamble grants “12 unforgettable Smile Wishes to children” to children across the country. The wishes can range anywhere from sponsoring treatments to supporting the dentistry dreams of deserving children, to providing free of cost check-ups. P&G Co is an American multinational consumer goods corporation, and a household name today, with a market cap of $381.78 billion as of the writing of this article. For Q2, 23/24 fiscal year, the company's revenue was $21.4 billion, which saw a 3% YoY increase.\xa0"", 'In the years to come, alongside community water fluoridation, community efforts like those of Henry Schein, Inc. and Procter & Gamble Co., will play a significant role in making oral healthcare accessible to all the citizens of the United States.\xa0', '20 States with the Most Fluoridated Water in the US', 'For our list of the states in the US with the most fluoridated water, we’ve considered the population percentage of each state that receives the most fluoridated water by the community water systems.

Fortune senior features writer Maria Aspan here, writing from New York City.', 'A few months ago, at a holiday party, I started chatting about traveling in Japan with an executive at Aflac. I thought I knew a lot about his company—that duck, those TV commercials, “AFLAAAAC!” But our conversation sparked my curiosity about the oddball life insurer; its improbable main market of Japan; its lesser-known business focus on cancer; and its longtime CEO Dan Amos, who’s been running the family-founded company for 34 years.', 'That makes Amos the fifth-longest tenured CEO of the Fortune 500, behind only Warren Buffett and a handful of other men. It’s a tremendous and rare accomplishment, especially given that the average Fortune 500 CEO lasts seven years. And, at age 72, Amos is healthy and isn’t planning on stepping back anytime soon: “There’s only so many fish I can catch,” he told me in February, when I visited the Aflac headquarters in Columbus, Ga. “I’m not going to be that good of a retiree.”', 'On the one hand, that’s great news for Aflac’s investors. Since Amos became CEO in 1990, succeeding his uncle (and Aflac cofounder) John Amos, he’s increased Aflac’s annual revenues sevenfold and sent its stock price and shareholder returns soaring. In particular, his decision to launch an unusual TV commercial in 2000, unleashing that squawking duck mascot, supercharged Aflac’s business and helped change how all insurance is marketed today.', 'Yet Aflac is also starting to show its age. Annual revenues have been shrinking since 2019. It’s facing a population crisis in Japan, where Aflac makes 70% of its profits, and where its core customers are aging—and dying out—at an alarming rate.', 'And even if he remains CEO for decades to come, Amos is closer to the end of his tenure than his beginning—raising questions about how he’s preparing his company to thrive after him. “Longevity brings stability,” says Cathy Seifert, an insurance industry analyst for CFRA Research. “But are you marking time? Or are you staying relevant and dynamic?”', 'I sat down with Amos to discuss all of this, for a feature profile in the new issue of Fortune. Our conversation ranged from the wacky—yes, there will be duck puns—to what Amos called the “feeding frenzy” over President Joe Biden’s age, and the wider discourse about the mental fitness of older leaders.', 'I came away with the impression of a CEO for whom all these business questions are incredibly personal. After running Aflac for 34 years, “it feels like one of my children,” Amos told me. “I believe I’m a better CEO because of the family connection.”', 'Read my full story here.', 'Maria Aspanmaria.aspan@fortune.com @mariaaspan', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Prior to this announcement, Freeport-McMoRan's dividend was only 47% of earnings, however it was paying out 189% of free cash flows.

Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio could be 22% by next year, which is in a pretty sustainable range.', ""The company has a long dividend track record, but it doesn't look great with cuts in the past. Since 2014, the dividend has gone from $1.25 total annually to $0.60. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 7.1% per year. Generally, we don't like to see a dividend that has been declining over time as this can degrade shareholders' returns and indicate that the company may be running into problems."", 'Dividends have been going in the wrong direction, so we definitely want to see a different trend in the earnings per share. Freeport-McMoRan has seen earnings per share falling at 6.6% per year over the last five years. Declining earnings will inevitably lead to the company paying a lower dividend in line with lower profits. Earnings are predicted to grow over the next year, but we would remain cautious until a track record of earnings growth is established.', ""In summary, while it's good to see that the dividend hasn't been cut, we are a bit cautious about Freeport-McMoRan's payments, as there could be some issues with sustaining them into the future. While Freeport-McMoRan is earning enough to cover the payments, the cash flows are lacking.

Contrary to popular belief, investors tend to stick with their dividend investments even when these equities lag. When the market’s focus was on the tech rally last year, investors held on to their dividend investments. This sentiment was also affirmed by David Harrell, who serves as the editor of Morningstar DividendInvestor. Here are some of his comments:', '“And when you have a more growth-oriented environment as we’ve had recently, certainly in 2023, dividend stocks are going to lag. But at the same time, dividend investors aren’t necessarily focusing on this horse race on a monthly or an annual basis like, well, are dividend stocks lagging the broad market or outperforming the broad market? Most of those investors, I believe, are focused on getting that yield from the portfolio. So, they’re getting the yield and generally hopefully getting some capital appreciation as well. So, as long as those yields are remaining strong for their portfolios, I don’t think it’s necessarily a concern.”', 'This optimistic outlook from analysts comes from the previous performance of dividend stocks.

The report also mentioned that during this period, the companies that maintained their dividend payments also surpassed non-dividend companies, delivering a 6.74% return.

Investors usually have to choose between one or the other of these attractive characteristics. But that might not be the case facing Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) investors right now."", ""The beverage giant dominates its global industry and yet its yield is sitting close to a post-pandemic high thanks to the combination of a rising payout and the stock's weak performance in 2023."", ""Sure, it's generally true that higher yields often come with some compromises, either around growth prospects or earnings potential. With that risk in mind, let's look at the main reasons why Coke pays more than peers like PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP), and whether income investors should still like the stock today."", ""Dividend growth is ultimately funded by sales growth and cash flow, and both metrics are slowing down in Coca-Cola's case. Organic sales growth landed at a bubbly 12% in fiscal 2023, but almost all that improvement came from rising prices. Volume rose just 2% for the year."", ""Price hikes in 2024 won't provide nearly the same lift that they have in the past few quarters. That's mainly because inflation has slowed, but also partly because consumers are becoming more price sensitive. Coke is also facing a slower consumer spending environment. As a result, management forecast that sales growth will be cut roughly in half in 2024, down to a range of about 6% to 7%."", ""The short-term outlook is weak when it comes to cash flow as well. Coke is expecting to generate $9.2 billion of free cash in 2024 to mark a 5% decline following last year's 2% uptick. The dividend can easily continue climbing through such a drop. Yet investors should brace for more modest dividend increases ahead in the next year or so."", ""Investors are being compensated well for taking on these elevated risks around Coke's short-term financial trends. The stock is valued at 5.7 times sales compared to its pandemic high of closer to 7 times sales. Its dividend yield is 3.1% as of this writing, compared to the 2.9% you'd get from owning Pepsi or the 2.7% rate available from Keurig Dr Pepper shares."", ""Owning $5,000 of Coke's shares would deliver roughly $150 of passive income in year one. The company has raised its payout in each of the last 61 years as well, so you can feel highly confident that the dividend will keep rising over the coming decade even if sales trends remain muted."", ""If you're looking for head-turning growth, then Coca-Cola stock might not be for you. Peer PepsiCo warned investors last month that consumer spending trends were slowing down to the pre-pandemic normal and that this shift is combining with falling inflation to pressure sales for the foreseeable future. Coke is facing many of the same challenges, and that helps explain why the stock underperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average in the last year. Most Wall Street pros are expecting sales to be flat this year before rising by about 5% in 2025."", ""Coke can do a lot with even modest sales growth, though, especially given that its operating profit margin is 28% of sales, or about twice PepsiCo's rate. Patient investors can get exposure to that industry-leading financial strength at a discount today while they wait for demand trends to rebound.

Why dividend payers? Well, they can appreciate in value just like other good stocks, but while doing so, they'll kick out cash to you regularly -- cash that can be used to support you in retirement or to buy additional shares of stock. And on top of that, healthy and growing dividend payers typically increase their payouts over time, too."", ""Here's the kicker: Dividend payers tend to perform better than non-payers, too! Check out the table below, adapted from a Hartford Funds report:"", 'Dividend-Paying Status', 'Average Annual Total Return, 1973-2022', 'Dividend growers and initiators', '10.24%', 'Dividend payers', '9.18%', 'No change in dividend policy', '6.60%', 'Dividend non-payers', '(0.60%)', 'Dividend shrinkers and eliminators', '3.95%', 'Data source: Ned Davis Research and Hartford Funds.', 'Here, then, are three dividend-paying stocks to consider for your portfolio.

Its business is growing, too, with third-quarter revenue increasing by 4.7% year over year and earnings per share (EPS) advancing by 8%. Medtronic is likely to keep growing, because it invests heavily in developing new treatments and products. It spent $2.7 billion on research and development in its fiscal year 2023, and recently had more than 200 active clinical trials in progress."", 'Meanwhile, the company is shedding less-profitable operations, such as its line of ventilators. Its stock looks attractively priced at recent levels, with a recent forward-looking price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 15.6, well below its five-year average of 18.1.', ""Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) needs little introduction, as it boasts more than 38,000 locations in more than 80 markets around the globe -- and it also has products on the shelves of many retailers, too. Starbucks' dividend recently yielded 2.5%. That payout has grown by an average annual rate of 10% over the past five years -- and it's likely that another increase will be announced this fall."", ""A solid and growing dividend is great, but you also should want the underlying company to be growing at a decent clip. In its first quarter, Starbucks' net revenue rose 8% to a record $9.4 billion, with sales at stores open more than a year increasing by 5% globally. Earnings per share surged 22%. One particularly successful Starbucks initiative has been its rewards program, with membership growing 13% year over year in the first quarter, to 34.3 million."", ""Everything isn't 100% rosy at the company -- overall inflation has many consumers cutting back on their spending, and Starbucks' growth rate is slower than in years past, in part because of competition. But it has still boosted its operating margin and has multiple irons in the growth fire -- such as offering delivery and drive-thru services. There's a lot to like about Starbucks' prospects -- and its stock seems undervalued, too, with its recent forward P/E of 22.3 well below the five-year average of 28.4."", ""PepsiCo (NASDAQ: PEP) is another familiar name, a $237-billion titan in both the soft-drink and salty-snack realms, with brands such as Lay's, Doritos, Cheetos, Gatorade, Pepsi-Cola, Mountain Dew, Quaker, and SodaStream. PepsiCo's dividend recently yielded 2.9%, and it has been upped by an annual average of 6% over the past five years.

Pepsico's stock valuation looks appealing, too, with its forward P/E of 20.0 well below the five-year average of 23.5."", ""These are just three of many attractive dividend payers out there. Remember, too, that if you aren't comfortable picking stocks on your own, you can always opt for one or more dividend-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs) -- and you can do so with just $400 or with much more."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Medtronic right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Medtronic, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Medtronic wasn’t one of them.

These companies have all paid and increased dividends for 50 years or more. This doesn't mean that the streaks will continue forever. Indeed, companies frequently drop off the list.

But from an investment perspective, these three companies share even more similarities than just their dividend longevity."", ""For starters, dividend investors like to consider a stock's dividend yield before investing -- this is how much investors have received for the value of their investment in the past year. The chart below shows that Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Hormel all have a dividend yield close to 3%, giving investors $3 for every $100 invested."", ""Additionally, dividend investors like to consider a company's payout ratio to assess the riskiness of the investment. This measures the percentage of a company's earnings that go toward the dividend. Generally speaking, lower is better. But Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Hormel have similar payout ratios at 74%, 74%, and 76% respectively."", ""Therefore, there's no clear winner between Coca-Cola, Pepsi, and Hormel when looking at their consecutive years of paying a dividend, their dividend yields, and their payout ratios. These factors being equal, I believe there's another factor to consider. And it makes Hormel the best option for investors looking to buy one of these three stocks today."", ""Over the next several years, I believe Hormel can grow its profits at a better pace than Coca-Cola and Pepsi. And that's why I like it best."", ""Consumers are well aware of Hormel's Chili and Spam. But most are probably unaware of just how many products and brands this company has. And with this portfolio of products, Hormel is on a mission to dominate convenience stores."", ""Hormel has long had a presence in convenience stores but a lot of it is under the radar. For example, investors might not know that it's a top company for pizza toppings and many convenience stores sell hot pizza using Hormel ingredients."", 'Moreover, Hormel sells snacks under its Skippy peanut butter brand, refrigerated snack trays, as well as microwavable meals with its Compleats brand.', 'Hormel had a convenience store presence already but acquired Planters in 2021. Planters is a more pure-play snacking brand and had a broader presence in convenience stores. Now the company can leverage the distribution of the Planters brand to expand the distribution of its other Hormel products.', ""Compared to sales at grocery stores, Hormel's profit margins are better in convenience stores and with its food-service products. Therefore, growth in this area could lead to better profitability. And profit growth leads to more room to service and grow its dividend."", ""Of course, there is a caveat to my upbeat expectations for Hormel: I'm counting on something to start happening within the next few years that's not going to happen this year. Hormel already reported financial results for its fiscal first quarter of 2024 and it gave full-year adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) guidance of $1.51 to $1.65."", ""For perspective, Hormel had adjusted diluted EPS of $1.61 in its fiscal 2023. Therefore, its guidance implies a potential drop in earnings. I'm counting on the growth in convenience-store channels to eventually start having a positive impact beyond fiscal 2024."", ""This uncertainty for Hormel is why Pepsi stock is a close second for a stock to buy today. Pepsi also has a strong path to earnings growth and it's a somewhat simpler proposition."", 'Pepsi is looking to its international business for profit growth more than ever. Revenue for its international operations was up 6% year over year in 2023. However, this led to a more than 200% increase in its international operating profit. And its international operating profit made up 38% of its total operating profit.', 'When discussing profitability for international operations, Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta said, ""Our international business is very scaled now."" And this scale points to further profit growth for the company as international sales grow. And Laguarta further said that the company expects international growth to outpace growth in North America again in 2024.', ""Therefore, Pepsi has a simple path to earnings growth, giving the stock upside potential as well.
