Its revenues and earnings in the quarter are expected to have improved on a year-over-year basis.In third-quarter 2022, Schwab’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results benefited from higher rates, which led to a rise in net interest income. Also, the absence of fee waivers and solid brokerage account numbers acted as tailwinds in the quarter. However, higher expenses hurt results to some extent.The company does not have an impressive earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two and lagged in two of the trailing four quarters.Schwab’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter encouraged analysts to revise earnings estimates upward. In the past 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for SCHW’s fourth-quarter earnings has been revised 1.9% higher to $1.10. The estimate indicates an increase of 27.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is $1.05.The consensus estimate for sales is pegged at $5.57 billion, which suggests an increase of 18.4% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Our estimate for total revenues is $5.49 billion, indicating a year-over-year rise of 16.7%.SCHW projects 2022 revenue growth of 11-13%, assuming the market’s forward rate expectations as of early-October.Before we take a look at what our quantitative model predicts, let’s check the factors that are likely to have impacted Schwab’s fourth-quarter performance.Key Factors &amp; Estimates for Q4Similar to the first three quarters of 2022, market volatility and client activity were robust in the fourth quarter. Few developments, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and continued supply-chain disruptions, led to ambiguity among investors.Also, the ultra-aggressive stance of the central banks across the globe to control inflation and resultant fears of an economic downturn/recession drove client activity and trading volumes. These factors led to heightened volatility in the equity markets and other asset classes, including commodities, bonds and foreign exchange.Investors seemed interested in entering the markets. In October, SCHW opened 298,000 new brokerage accounts. In November, brokerage accounts opened were 303,000.While Schwab’s trading performance is expected to have been robust in the quarter under review, supported by higher volatility and client activity, trading revenues are not expected to have improved much from the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter trading revenues is pegged at $905 million, which suggests a decline of 11% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for trading revenues is $1.05 billion.Then, the consensus estimate for average interest-earning assets for the to-be-reported quarter is pegged at $540 billion, which suggests a decline of 8.2% from the prior-year quarter’s reported level. Our estimate for average interest-earning assets is $617.2 billion, suggesting year-over-year growth of 4.9%.In the fourth quarter, the Federal Reserve continued with its ultra-hawkish monetary policy stance, raising interest rates by another 125 basis points. The policy rate reached 4.25-4.50%, the highest in the past 15 years. Also, the overall lending scenario was decent.Thus, supported by loan growth and higher interest rates, Schwab’s net interest revenues are likely to have been positively impacted. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for net interest revenues is pegged at $3 billion, which suggests a year-over-year rise of 39.9%. Our estimate for the same is also $3 billion.Management expects net interest revenues of $3 billion in the fourth quarter as well. Net interest margin is expected to be in the mid-210 bps zone.The consensus estimate for asset management and administration fees of $1.07 billion suggests a decline of 3.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported number. Our estimate for the same is $1.02 billion, indicating a year-over-year fall of 8.3%.Coming to expenses, Schwab’s operating expenses have been elevated in the past few quarters. Due to the persistent regulatory spending and strategic buyouts to drive efficiency, overall expenses are expected to have been high in the to-be-reported quarter. We project total expenses to rise 12.7% year over year to $3.03 billion.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model UnveilsAccording to our quantitative model, the chances of Schwab beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings this time are high. This is because it has the right combination of the two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: The Earnings ESP for Schwab is +1.08%.Zacks Rank: The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Other Stocks Worth a LookA few other finance stocks, which you may want to consider, as these too have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat in their upcoming releases per our model, are Hancock Whitney Corporation HWC and Truist Financial Corporation TFC.Hancock Whitney is scheduled to release fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Jan 17.

2,7ebd82b0-d077-3f70-a44e-b0d75b59a459,ARE,2023-01-17,Here's Why Alexandria (ARE) is an Apt Portfolio Pick for Now,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-alexandria-apt-portfolio-140402290.html,1673877842,STORY,['ARE'],"[Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. ARE has a portfolio of high-quality, niche assets — life science, technology and agtech properties — in strategic markets, which positions it well for growth.This Pasadena, CA-based urban office real estate investment trust (REIT) has been witnessing healthy demand for its properties amid the growing need for drug research and innovation. Moreover, favorable demand-supply dynamics and the company’s strong pricing power in its core markets give it a competitive edge.Shares of this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company have rallied 15.9% over the past three months, outperforming its industry's growth of 11.6%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors That Make Alexandria a Solid PickHealthy Operating Performance: Alexandria’s Class A properties are situated in the AAA innovation cluster locations of North America, with significant market presence in Greater Boston, San Francisco Bay Area, New York City, San Diego, Seattle, Maryland and Research Triangle. These locations are characterized by high barriers to entry and a limited supply of available spaces. The advantageous locations of its properties have been driving demand, resulting in high occupancy levels.As of Sep 30, 2022, the occupancy of operating properties in North America remained high at 94.3%. The occupancy, excluding the vacancy at the recently acquired properties, was 98.4% as of the same date. Given the robust demand for its properties, ARE is expected to witness high levels of occupancy in the upcoming quarters, which will support rent growth.Strong Tenant Base: ARE has a strong tenant base of more than 1,000 high-quality companies, which ensures steady rental revenues. As of Sep 30, 2022, investment-grade or publicly-traded large-cap tenants accounted for 49% of the annual rental revenues in effect. The weighted-average remaining lease term of all the tenants is 7.2 years, and for the company’s top 20 tenants, it is 9.7 years.Continued Strong Internal Growth: Alexandria has been experiencing strong internal growth. It witnessed total leasing activity of 6.4 million rentable square feet (RSF) of space from the beginning of the year through Sep 30, 2022, based on strong demand for its high-quality office/laboratory space. The lease renewals and re-leasing of space totaled 3 million RSF. Also, it registered rental rate growth of 34.3% and 24.2% (cash basis) during this period, respectively. With solid demand for its properties, this upbeat trend is likely to continue.Acquisitions &amp; Development: In order to enhance its operating platform, Alexandria has been focusing on the acquisition, development and redevelopment of new Class A properties in AAA locations. In the third quarter of 2022, ARE completed acquisitions in its key life-science cluster submarkets totaling 1.2 million RSF of value-creation opportunities for $316.7 million. It also placed into service development and redevelopment projects totaling 332,961 RSF across multiple submarkets during the quarter.  Moreover, its development pipeline is encouraging for long-term growth. As of Sep 30, 2022, ARE had 5.6 million RSF of the Class A properties undergoing construction. Further, it had 9.9 million RSF of near-term and intermediate-term development and redevelopment projects and 17.9 million SF of future development projects.Balance Sheet Strength: Alexandria maintains a robust balance-sheet position with ample liquidity. It exited third-quarter 2022 with $6.4 billion of liquidity. It has no debt maturities prior to 2025.The company enjoys investment-grade credit ratings of Baa1/Stable and BBB+/Positive from Moody’s and S&amp;P Global Ratings, respectively, rendering it favorable access to the debt market. With a strong financial footing and enough financial flexibility, it is well-placed to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.FFO Growth: The FFO per share is expected to be up 8.38% for 2022 compared with the industry’s average of 3.94%.Dividend: ARE is known for consistently raising its dividend rates, which remains a huge attraction for REIT investors. In December 2022, it increased its dividend payment from $1.18 per share to $1.21, representing a sequential hike of 2.5%. Based on the increased rate, the annual dividend comes to $4.84 per share. Also, Alexandria increased its dividend 10 times in the last five years, and the five-year annualized dividend growth rate is 6.07%.Given the company’s strong operating platform, robust financial position and lower payout ratio compared with the industry, the dividend rate is likely to be sustainable in the near term.Story continuesStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are VICI Properties VICI, First Industrial Realty Trust FR and Stag Industrial STAG, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2.

3,ad015778-cf38-3e24-99c1-c336f62b1cd7,UNM,2023-01-17,5 Promising Price-to-Book Value Stocks to Buy in 2023,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-promising-price-book-value-104610690.html,1673952370,STORY,"['SIG', 'DBK.DE', 'UNM', 'HT', 'HT-PE']","[Value analysis is the best approach to identify great bargains. Though price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio, sometimes called the market-to-book ratio, is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of the book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft DB, Signet Jewelers SIG, Unum Group UNM, Hersha Hospitality Trust HT and Sterling Infrastructure STRL are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.

4,2e1270f6-2c18-3dec-ad95-7d05e118c8b1,UNM,2023-01-17,Pick These 4 Low P/CF Stocks to Spruce Up Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pick-4-low-p-cf-151703296.html,1673882223,STORY,"['UNM', 'NRG', 'SIG']","[Value style is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Signet Jewelers Limited SIG, NRG Energy, Inc. NRG, Unum Group UNM and Sterling Infrastructure STRL  boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:Signet, the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry, sports a Zacks Rank #1. It has an expected EPS growth rate of 8% for three-five years.

However, the season will gather pace this week. This reporting cycle will be important as market participants will closely monitor any sign of earnings, revenues or margin decline.A large section of economists and financial experts are concerned that the U.S. economy may face at least a mild recession in 2023 with a higher interest rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed.Nevertheless, five insurers are likely to beat Q4 2022 earnings results. These are - Aflac Inc. AFL, Reinsurance Group of America Inc. RGA, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc. MMC, Unum Group UNM and The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV.Insurance Sector Q4 2022An improving interest rate environment benefits life insurers as their products and investments are rate sensitive. A favorable interest rate thus impacts life insurers' earnings, capital and reserves, liquidity, and competitiveness positively.Insurance brokerage firms are continuously expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products. The rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance.To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. Insurers are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate.Accelerated digitization is also curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. It will also help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and retention rate. While investments in technology increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, insurers must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Story continuesOur Top PicksFive insurance companies are set to beat on fourth quarter earnings results.

(GES) Gains on Growing Online Business & Strategic Plan,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/guess-ges-gains-growing-online-132601115.html,1673875561,STORY,"['PVH', 'GES', 'OXM', 'RL']","[Guess? Inc. GES is benefiting from its strategic business plan. Strength in the company’s digital business has also been aiding growth. However, the apparel and accessories company is not immune to the rising inflationary environment.Let’s delve deeper.Factors Favoring Guess?Guess? is committed to its six key strategies and has made remarkable progress against each of them. The core strategies include organization and culture, functional capacities, brand relevance with three main consumer groups (heritage, Millennials and Generation Z customers), customer focus, product brilliance and international footprint.With respect to its salesforce and omnichannel capacity rollout, Guess? focuses on implementing Customer 360 — a solution developed by salesforce for personalized marketing, customer data optimization and customers’ journey engagement, among other objectives. As part of the Customer 360 project, management launched its CRM platform in 2021, which gives the company a 360 view of the customer and fuels improved personalization, marketing and promotional strategies.Speaking on digital transformation and CRM, management highlighted that it is in progress to optimize the new platform utilization and implement the CRM solution. The company rolled out the suite across Europe by the end of 2022 and across North America at the beginning of 2023. The company recently developed a new clienteling application and is on track to launch it in Europe.In addition, Guess? is focused on a brand-elevation strategy, which includes enhancing product quality, visual merchandising and boosting customers’ shopping experience across stores and online. In terms of brand elevation, the company is benefiting from the launch of its global line for all product categories over the last few years. These efforts improve all aspects of design like taste, style, quality and sustainability. Management is also committed to enhancing pricing, marketing campaigns, e-commerce inventory and visual merchandising. Guess? is on track with supply chain and inventory management to counter supply chain disruptions.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHurdles on the WayThe company reported dismal third-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the top and the bottom line declining year over year and the latter falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Guess? posted adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share, down 29%. Earnings were hurt by the negative impact of currency translations. Net revenues amounted to $633.4 million, declining 2% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin contracted 320 basis points to 42.5%, mainly due to unfavorable currency headwinds. In addition, a greater mix of markdowns relative to the year-ago quarter was a concern.Guess? has been battling the adverse impacts of global inflation and softening economic sentiment. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it expects soft consumer demand and inflationary pressures to continue affecting its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results and beyond. In addition, adverse impacts of unfavorable foreign currency rates are hurdles on the way. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Guess? Expects revenues to be down almost 3.5% on a reported basis.That said, we believe that the aforementioned upsides are likely to help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company stay afloat amid such hurdles.GES’s stock has gained 42.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 18.1%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies from the Consumer Discretionary sector are Ralph Lauren RL, PVH Corp.

9,812f5479-384d-381d-868e-914d7ea19a7f,USB,2023-01-17,U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) shareholders have endured a 21% loss from investing in the stock a year ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-bancorp-nyse-usb-shareholders-120047737.html,1673956847,STORY,['USB-PQ'],"[While not a mind-blowing move, it is good to see that the U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) share price has gained 15% in the last three months. But in truth the last year hasn't been good for the share price. After all, the share price is down 24% in the last year, significantly under-performing the market.So let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. View our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Unhappily, U.S. Bancorp had to report a 16% decline in EPS over the last year. The share price decline of 24% is actually more than the EPS drop. This suggests the EPS fall has made some shareholders are more nervous about the business. The P/E ratio of 11.63 also points to the negative market sentiment.You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for U.S. Bancorp the TSR over the last 1 year was -21%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 15% in the twelve months, U.S. Bancorp shareholders did even worse, losing 21% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 0.3% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand U.S. Bancorp better, we need to consider many other factors.

The company is facing headwinds related to the coronavirus pandemic and macroeconomic uncertainties continue to remain overhangs. Further, intensifying competition in the online travel booking space remains a concern.Nevertheless, Booking Holdings is benefiting from substantial improvement in its booking trends owing to increasing travel demand. A surge in repeat customers is creating growth in the company's active customers. Further, the company is experiencing growth in rental car, airline ticket units and booked room nights, which is a positive.Strong growth across the agency, merchant, and advertising and other businesses is contributing well. The Zacks analyst expects growth across these businesses to continue in the days ahead.

A concentrated loan portfolio and legal hassles are other key headwinds.However, U.S. Bancorp has a decent earnings surprise history, with earnings beating estimates in three of the trailing four quarters. Third-quarter results reflect a rise in revenues, supported by higher interest rates and margins.The bank has received all required regulatory approvals for the acquisition of MUFG Union Bank's core regional banking franchise.

Also, stiff competition poses financial risk for the company.However, CME Group's strong market position driven by varied derivative product lines bodes well. Efforts to expand and cross sell through strategic alliances, acquisitions, new product initiatives and a stable global presence bode well.Product innovation and growing proportion of volume from customers outside the United States have been aiding results.

(NYSE: CF), the world’s largest producer of ammonia, today announced that it has signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with JERA Co., Inc. (JERA), Japan’s largest energy generator, regarding the supply of up to 500,000 metric tonnes per year of clean ammonia beginning in 2027. The execution of the MOU is the result of a supplier comparison and evaluation process for the procurement of clean ammonia that JERA initiated in February 2022 for the world’s first commercial scale ammonia co-firing operations.The clean ammonia, which will be required to be produced with at least 60% lower carbon emissions than conventionally produced ammonia, will be co-fired with coal at JERA’s Hekinan Thermal Power Station in order to reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from the facility. Ammonia does not emit CO2 when combusted. JERA has successfully concluded an ammonia co-firing pilot test and will begin a demonstration project during its fiscal year 2023 at its Hekinan power plant.The MOU establishes a framework for the companies to assess how CF Industries would best supply JERA with clean ammonia under a long-term offtake agreement. The companies expect to evaluate a range of potential supply options, including an equity investment alongside CF Industries to develop a greenfield clean ammonia facility in Louisiana and a supplementary long-term offtake agreement from CF Industries’ Donaldsonville Complex in Louisiana""We are pleased to continue to build our relationship with JERA as we advance our shared commitment to accelerate the world’s transition to clean energy,"" said Tony Will, president and chief executive officer, CF Industries Holdings, Inc. ""Our leading ammonia production network and disciplined investments in clean energy initiatives have positioned CF Industries at the forefront of clean ammonia supply. We look forward to helping JERA and Japan meet its clean ammonia requirements, which represent the first significant volume of what we believe will be substantial global demand for clean ammonia as a clean energy source.""Story continuesJERA Corporate Vice President Yukio Kani said, ""We are pleased to work together with CF Industries on this significant journey towards decarbonizing the industry, and I am confident that CF Industries’ reliable operational capabilities that formed its track record for safe and efficient production as the world’s largest ammonia producer will profoundly contribute to JERA’s structuring of the clean fuel ammonia value chain. JERA will continue its own efforts as well as to take hands with our partners in pursuit of our endeavor to realize and accelerate not only the decarbonization of the Japanese energy industry but also to solve the energy-related issues that the world is facing.""Since 2020, CF Industries has advanced industry-leading projects to decarbonize its ammonia production network and position the Company to supply a substantial volume of clean ammonia within the next few years. This includes leveraging carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technologies at its Donaldsonville Complex where CF Industries is constructing a CO2 dehydration and compression facility to enable the capture and permanent sequestration of up to 2 million tons of CO2 per year, which is expected to begin in 2025. The Company has also commenced a front end engineering and design study to construct a greenfield clean ammonia facility utilizing CCS in Ascension Parish, Louisiana. Additionally, CF Industries is constructing North America’s first commercial scale green ammonia capacity at its Donaldsonville Complex, enabling up to 20,000 tons of green ammonia production beginning in 2024.About CF Industries Holdings, Inc.At CF Industries, our mission is to provide clean energy to feed and fuel the world sustainably.

In the 'long' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.Below, we take a look at Cintas (CTAS), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Cintas currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;Set to Beat the Market?Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for CTAS that show why this uniform rental company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.Story continuesFor CTAS, shares are up 1.58% over the past week while the Zacks Uniform and Related industry is up 0.29% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 0.82% compares favorably with the industry's 4.05% performance as well.Considering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Over the past quarter, shares of Cintas have risen 12.25%, and are up 12.95% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&amp;P 500 has only moved 9.41% and -12.82%, respectively.Investors should also pay attention to CTAS's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. CTAS is currently averaging 331,031 shares for the last 20 days.Earnings OutlookThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with CTAS.Over the past two months, 9 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost CTAS's consensus estimate, increasing from $12.49 to $12.68 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 7 estimates have moved upwards while there have been 2 downward revisions in the same time period.Bottom LineGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that CTAS is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Cintas on your short list.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

15,8b06f7d8-af3d-3ffc-a834-82174787c266,EW,2023-01-17,What's in Store for Edwards Lifesciences (EW) in Q4 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-store-edwards-lifesciences-ew-132701422.html,1673875621,STORY,['EW'],"[Edwards Lifesciences Corporation EW is expected to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 25, 2023.In the last reported quarter, the company’s adjusted earnings per share of 61 cents missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.6%. The company’s earnings beat estimates in one of the trailing four quarters, met the same in one and missed two. EW has a trailing four-quarter negative surprise of 1.36%, on average.Let's see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayCritical CareEdwards Lifesciences is likely to have gained from the continued demand for its state-of-the-art HemoSphere monitoring platform. The increase in hospital visits with the improving market scenario is likely to have benefited HemoSphere sales, thus adding to the top line. In the prior quarter, the company’s portfolio of Smart Recovery sensors, including FloTrac and ClearSight sensors with our unique hypotension prediction index algorithm, witnessed increased adoption by supporting more patients in the intensive care unit. We believe this trend to have continued in the fourth quarter, benefiting the segment’s results.Our model shows a 3.2% year-over-year decline in Critical Care revenues in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $212 million, in line with the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Surgical Structural HeartEdwards Lifesciences is likely to have gained from the increased penetration of the company’s premium RESILIA products. Edwards Lifesciences has seen strong adoption of the MITRIS RESILIA valve in the United States since its initial launch in April and represents most of the mitral valve sales in this region. Based on the market adoption of the company’s newest premium technologies and surgical market growth, fourth-quarter revenues in the segment are expected to have been strong for Edwards Lifesciences.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Story continuesEdwards Lifesciences Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseEdwards Lifesciences Corporation price-eps-surprise | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation Quote Our model shows a 17.5% year-over-year rise in Surgical Structural Heart revenues in the fourth quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the segment’s fourth-quarter revenues is pegged at $231 million, suggesting a rise of 4.5% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Other Factors at PlayWithin the Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) arm, the company is likely to have witnessed continued growth in TAVR procedures across the United States and worldwide. During the last reported quarter, the company received approval to sell the SAPIEN 3 Ultra RESILIA valve in the United States. Additionally, enrollment accelerated in the 2 TAVR pivotal trials to progress in evaluating patients with moderate AS and alliance for next-generation TAVR technology —  SAPIEN X4. These developments are likely to have boosted company’s fourth-quarter sales within the business.The company’s Transcatheter Mitral and Tricuspid Therapies segment’s PASCAL platform is likely to have maintained strong growth momentum in the fourth quarter. This rally is expected to have been driven by the strong adoption of the PASCAL system in Europe as the company initiated a limited introduction of PASCAL PRECISION and continues its expansion into more centers in Europe.However, foreign exchange headwinds and a spike in COVID in Germany —  the company’s largest region in Europe — are likely to have impeded the segment’s growth in the quarter to be reported.Q4 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fourth-quarter 2022 revenues is pegged at $1.33 billion, suggesting a rise of 0.09% from the year-ago reported figure.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its third-quarter 2022 net earnings of 62 cents indicates 19.6% growth from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) and a positive Earnings ESP has a higher chance of beating estimates. This is exactly the case here, as you can see below:Earnings ESP: The company has an Earnings ESP of -4.53%.

(NYSE:JWN) A Top Quality Stock?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boasting-54-return-equity-nordstrom-120337391.html,1673957017,STORY,['JWN'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. Check out our latest analysis for Nordstrom How To Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Nordstrom is:54% = US$326m ÷ US$606m (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.54.Does Nordstrom Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. Pleasingly, Nordstrom has a superior ROE than the average (25%) in the Multiline Retail industry.roeThat is a good sign. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk . To know the 2 risks we have identified for Nordstrom visit our risks dashboard for free.How Does Debt Impact Return On Equity?Most companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesNordstrom's Debt And Its 54% ROEIt appears that Nordstrom makes extensive use of debt to improve its returns, because it has an alarmingly high debt to equity ratio of 4.88. Its ROE is clearly quite good, but it seems to be boosted by the significant use of debt by the company.ConclusionReturn on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to check this FREE visualization of analyst forecasts for the company.But note: Nordstrom may not be the best stock to buy.

However, the season will gather pace this week. This reporting cycle will be important as market participants will closely monitor any sign of earnings, revenues or margin decline.A large section of economists and financial experts are concerned that the U.S. economy may face at least a mild recession in 2023 with a higher interest rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed.Nevertheless, five insurers are likely to beat Q4 2022 earnings results. These are - Aflac Inc. AFL, Reinsurance Group of America Inc. RGA, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc. MMC, Unum Group UNM and The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV.Insurance Sector Q4 2022An improving interest rate environment benefits life insurers as their products and investments are rate sensitive. A favorable interest rate thus impacts life insurers' earnings, capital and reserves, liquidity, and competitiveness positively.Insurance brokerage firms are continuously expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products. The rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance.To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. Insurers are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate.Accelerated digitization is also curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. It will also help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and retention rate. While investments in technology increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, insurers must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Story continuesOur Top PicksFive insurance companies are set to beat on fourth quarter earnings results. Each of these stocks carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a positive Earnings ESP. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Our research shows that for stocks with the combination of a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better and a positive Earnings ESP, the chance of an earnings beat is as high as 70%. These stocks are anticipated to appreciate after their earnings releases. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.The chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the ast quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Travelers Companies boasts a strong market presence in auto, homeowners’ insurance and commercial U.S. property-casualty insurance with solid inorganic growth. A high retention rate, increase in new business and positive renewal premium change bode well.TRV’s commercial businesses should perform well owing to market stability. The Travelers Companies remains optimistic about the personal line of business, given growth at the profitable agency auto and homeowners business. TRV expects fixed income NII, including earnings from short-term securities, to be around $500 million after-tax in the fourth quarter.The Travelers Companies has an Earnings ESP of +2.59%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 11.2% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last seven days.TRV recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 25.4%. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 24, before the opening bell.Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies is well-poised to grow on the back of significant investments and acquisitions made within its operating units, the launch of new products and branching out into new businesses.MMC’s increased stake in Marsh India will further buoy growth. Revenues have been increasing thanks to a wide geographic presence and strong client retention. The Risk and Insurance Services unit has been contributing to revenue growth too.Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies has an Earnings ESP of +5.67%. It has an expected earnings growth rate of 9.8% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1% over the last seven days.MMC recorded earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 3.2%. The company is set to release earnings results on Jan 26, before the opening bell.Unum Group’s conservative pricing and reservation practices have contributed to overall profitability.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest In. A holding company is a business entity, usually a corporation or limited liability company, that does not directly manufacture products, offer any services, or carry out any other business operations. Instead, holding companies own controlling stakes in other companies. The main purpose of a holding company is to offer centralized management, and they may also be used for tax or liability purposes. So while it may oversee a subsidiary’s management decisions, a holding company does not actively engage in the daily operations of these subsidiaries.While a holding company structure can be complicated to navigate, it offers multiple benefits including centralized management and control, limited liability, tax relief, flexibility in terms of investment opportunities and diversifying risk, and branding and reputation management. However, holding companies are subject to additional regulations, limited control over the day-to-day operations of their subsidiary companies, dependence on the performance of subsidiary companies, and problems in raising capital. Some of the best holding company stocks to invest in include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A). Investors can also take a look at the biggest holding companies in the world for a well-rounded stock portfolio.

MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest In.  Suggested articles:11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy15 Largest Orthopedic Companies in the World11 Undervalued Mid Cap Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest In is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest In.  Suggested articles:11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy15 Largest Orthopedic Companies in the World11 Undervalued Mid Cap Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest In is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Coal mines in major mining regions such as Shanxi and Inner Mongolia have recorded many workers off sick.While the lifting of restrictions is expected to raise coal demand from non-utility sectors such steel and cement in the medium term, the surging COVID cases have forced factories to cut back output because of labour shortages.The slowdown in industrial demand has continued into January and is expected to persist through the Lunar New Year holiday at the end of this week.China's coal production is expected to expand further in 2023 amid Beijing's emphasis on bolstering energy security. The country is assessed to have approved 260 million tonnes of coal mining capacity in 2022, bringing total capacity to 5.05 billion tonnes.The National Development and Reform Commission also urged utilities to expand term contracts with domestic miners in 2023, which should prompt miners to further boost their output.Graphic: China's coal production (bln T) https://www.reuters.com/graphics/CHINA-COAL/OUTPUT/lbvggownlvq/chart.png(Reporting by Andrew Hayley in London and Muyu Xu in Singapore; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)]"

""We didn't execute perfectly on some so we've taken a hard look at those, and you make adjustments.""LOW BARUBS analysts wrote in a note Morgan Stanley's fourth-quarter core trends were encouraging and cleared the low bar.Revenue from Morgan Stanley's investment banking business fell 49% to $1.25 billion in the fourth quarter, with revenue declines across the bank's advisory, equity and fixed income segments.The investment banking business slowdown weighed on the company's net revenue, pulling it down 12% to $12.7 billion.""I am highly confident that when the Fed pauses, deal activity and underwriting activity will go up,"" Chief Executive Officer James Gorman told analysts in a call.Still, Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya told Reuters earlier on Tuesday that the bank is comfortable with its headcount after recent layoffs. Morgan Stanley had cut 2% of its headcount in December, or about 1,600 jobs, a source had told Reuters.Trading has been a surprise bright spot for Morgan Stanley, with the unit's revenue jumping 26% in the fourth quarter, as clients look to hedge against market risks by rejiggering portfolios toward more defensive assets.Looking ahead, Gorman said the bank's wealth and investment management businesses are expected to become an increasingly larger portion of the firm's pre-tax profit in the coming years.The wealth management unit has also helped the bank keep its funding cost lower amid a rate hiking cycle, the CEO added.Mark-to-market losses on corporate loans came in at $876 million, as interest rates rose. It includes debt to Twitter, the CFO said. Morgan Stanley is among a group of banks that provided a $13 billion loan to finance Elon Musk's acquisition of the social media company.Updating Morgan Stanley's outlook, the CFO said the bank's net interest income, or the money banks bring in from interest payments, has not peaked, although it is likely to reduce its growth rate this year.(Reporting by Manya Saini and Mehnaz Yasmin in Bengaluru and Carolina Mandl and Saeed Azhar in New York; Additional reporting by Amruta Khandekar; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta, Mark Porter and Anna Driver)]"

From time to time, Morgan Stanley may disclose certain ""non-GAAP financial measures"" in the course of its earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and otherwise. The Securities and Exchange Commission defines a ""non-GAAP financial measure"" as a numerical measure of historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that is subject to adjustments that effectively exclude, or include amounts from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by Morgan Stanley are provided as additional information to analysts, investors and other stakeholders in order to provide them with greater transparency about, or an alternative method for assessing our financial condition, operating results, or capital adequacy. These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for U.S. GAAP, and may be different from or inconsistent with non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also generally define it or present the most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP financial measure we reference and such comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure.4 Our earnings releases, earnings conference calls, financial presentations and other communications may also include certain metrics which we believe to be useful to us, analysts, investors, and other stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an additional means of assessing, our financial condition and operating results.5 Return on average tangible common equity and return on average tangible equity excluding integration-related expenses are non-GAAP financial measures that the Firm considers useful for analysts, investors and other stakeholders to allow comparability of period-to-period operating performance and capital adequacy. The calculation of return on average tangible common equity represents full year or annualized net income applicable to Morgan Stanley less preferred dividends as a percentage of average tangible common equity. Tangible common equity, also a non-GAAP financial measure, represents common equity less goodwill and intangible assets net of allowable mortgage servicing rights deduction.6 The Firm’s and business segment’s fourth quarter and full year results for 2022 and 2021 include integration-related expenses as a result of the E*TRADE and Eaton Vance acquisitions reported in the Wealth Management segment and Investment Management segment, respectively.

A stablecoin is a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset, such as the U.S. dollar or gold.The benefits and risks of CBDCs depend on their design and issuance, but Bank of America expects central banks in developed economies to focus on payments efficiency and those on developing countries to focus on financial inclusion.Still, CBDCs aren't without their risks. They may drive competition with bank deposits, and could lead to a loss of monetary sovereignty and inequality among countries globally, the note said.CBDC issuance may not happen for over a decade in some counties, but central banks are expected to “adopt technological advances or risk irrelevance over the longer term,” the note added.Bank of America says it expects central banks and governments will drive digital-asset innovation with input from the private sector.Read more: What Will 2023 Bring for CBDCs?]"

Other companies that were also in the running were Vitol and BB Energy, the sources said.Uniper and Montfort declined to comment.The Fujairah plant processes mainly African sweet, or low-sulphur, crude oil, producing about 5 million tonnes per year of very low-sulphur fuel oil (VLSFO), according to Uniper and Refinitiv data.Montfort has a bunker supplier licence in Fujairah under the entity of Montfort Trading FZE. The company trades liquid and bulk commodities and also invests in assets and infrastructure, according to its website.Montfort has acquired oil marketing company Kencor Petroleum Ltd in Kenya, bought stakes in Matola Terminal de Armazenamento de Petróleos SA, an oil storage terminal operator in Mozambique, and South African trader New Age Energy, according to its website.($1 = 0.9236 euros)(Reporting by Florence Tan and Jeslyn Lerh in Singapore, Dmitry Zhdannikov and Julia Payne in London, Christoph Steitz in Frankfurt and Maha El Dahan in Dubai; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)]"

These include petroleum products (26.9%), engineering goods (11.9%), gems and jewellery (15.2%), and drugs and pharmaceuticals (1.9%). On the other hand, imports of key items like gold, silver, electronic goods, and project goods also contracted.India’s exports to the US were highest at $59.6 billion in April-December 2022. Others that followed are the UAE, Netherlands, Bangladesh, and Singapore.India should aim to reduce its import billWith the likelihood of a global recession rising in 2023, Indian traders are likely to face more challenges. A part of the problem is that India imports more than it exports, inflating the country’s trade balance.Analysts believe its reliance on crude oil for 80% of its energy requirements must be reduced. “India must re-energize exploration of local oil fields and enhance production through coal mines. Any development will cut the energy import bill substantially and improve the current account,” The Economic Times reported in January, citing the economic think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).Story continuesIndia is estimated to pay $270 billion for coal and crude imports in 2022, accounting for about 40% of its total merchandise bill, GTRI said.India’s commerce ministry is doing a “country-wise as well as commodity-wise” analysis to boost exports, the Financial Times reported today, quoting commerce secretary Sunil Bharthwal.

Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App.Half a world away, big tech is in a world of its own.Yours truly and our very own Julie Hyman are on the ground again in Davos, Switzerland for the 53rd World Economic Forum this week.On Saturday afternoon, in a ritual I've developed having attended several of WEFs, I walked up and down the ""Promenade"" to breathe in the environment and observe.In a way, the exercise focuses my mind before I stay awake to churn out stories, chat up the powerful, and expand my iPhone contacts list.People walk during snowfall on the Promenade road, ahead of the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2023 in the Alpine resort of Davos, Switzerland, January 15, 2023. REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannThe Promenade is where big businesses such as IBM, Salesforce, and Qualcomm set up little houses to wine and dine potential customers — and in some cases toss lavish nighttime parties. In recent years, crypto has had a large presence on the Promenade, and outside these locations you'll often find a host of colorful looking characters pontificating on bitcoin $1,000,000.Amid the FTX fallout, the often bizarre crypto crews with limited badge access to key buildings have mostly rolled out of town — although there is an undercurrent of stablecoin-focused companies still beating the drum on their own awesomeness this year.Most surprising to me this year, though, is the dominant showing of Big Tech companies at WEF despite the likes of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Salesforce (CRM) laying off thousands of workers amid sharp slowdowns in sales and profits.Amazon, SAP, Meta, IBM, Salesforce, and Zoom all have cool installations on the Promenade. Their coffee machines look great inside, as does the furniture. It's as if tech isn't in a recession of its own!Story continuesThese snazzy setups are surely expensive — not to mention the cost of sending representatives to spread the gospel in Davos, sit in on a few provoking panels in the Congress Center, and maybe close a few deals.Meta's stock is down 65% in the past year. The company is in the process of firing 11,000 workers. Yet, it's party on for Meta at this year's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Photo source: Brian Sozzi/Yahoo Finance""Tech stalwarts are used to spending money like 1980 rockstars, and Davos is just another notch on the belt,"" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives tells me. ""While layoffs are now on the doorstep and 2022 was a horror show year for tech stocks, these firms need to keep the foot on the marketing spending gas pedal as it’s an arms race in the tech world.""Some will say WEF is the most cost-efficient way to meet very powerful people all in one place and set the table for making money in the future. I get it, and agree to a certain extent. After all, I'm here, too.But the tech recession is real, and is likely not ending in 2023 amid elevated interest rates.Maybe it would have been good for Big Tech to give a nod to their now-former employees and currently hurting investors and reel it in at Davos 2023?For some, perhaps they shouldn't even be in attendance given how far their fundamentals and stock prices have fallen. I think a more measured approach would have sent a needed signal to markets that tech execs are listening, and want to get out of this funk before 2025.Alas, they are here in force. So in that regard, let's see what the nighttime parties bring, I suppose.We'll have more on that this week along with a host of massive interviews featuring a Who's Who in global business, so I encourage you to stay highly engaged with Yahoo Finance Live for these market-moving discussions.Happy Trading!What to Watch TodayEconomy8:30 A.M.

The survey was released as the WEF kicks off.""The bleak CEO outlook is the most pessimistic CEOs have been regarding global economic growth since we began asking this question 12 years ago and is a significant departure from the optimistic outlooks of 2021 and 2022, when more than two-thirds (76% and 77%, respectively) thought economic growth would improve,"" PwC stated in a press release.Inflation, macroeconomic volatility, and geopolitical conflict ranked as the top threats to businesses.

""If organizations are not only to thrive – but survive the next few years – they must carefully balance the dual imperative of mitigating shortterm risks and operational demands with long-term outcomes — as businesses that don’t transform, won’t be viable.""The lone bright spot in the survey was that CEOs say they don't plan to cut deeply from a layoff perspective: Roughly 60% of respondents have no intentions to reduce headcount while 80% have no plans to lower compensation amid an ongoing fight to retain talent.The less-than-upbeat vibe among CEOs at WEF arrive as investors are still feeling the sting of the 2022 bear market in stocks and with recession fears swirling due to rising interest rates.

GES is benefiting from its strategic business plan. Strength in the company’s digital business has also been aiding growth. However, the apparel and accessories company is not immune to the rising inflationary environment.Let’s delve deeper.Factors Favoring Guess?Guess? is committed to its six key strategies and has made remarkable progress against each of them. The core strategies include organization and culture, functional capacities, brand relevance with three main consumer groups (heritage, Millennials and Generation Z customers), customer focus, product brilliance and international footprint.With respect to its salesforce and omnichannel capacity rollout, Guess? focuses on implementing Customer 360 — a solution developed by salesforce for personalized marketing, customer data optimization and customers’ journey engagement, among other objectives. As part of the Customer 360 project, management launched its CRM platform in 2021, which gives the company a 360 view of the customer and fuels improved personalization, marketing and promotional strategies.Speaking on digital transformation and CRM, management highlighted that it is in progress to optimize the new platform utilization and implement the CRM solution. The company rolled out the suite across Europe by the end of 2022 and across North America at the beginning of 2023. The company recently developed a new clienteling application and is on track to launch it in Europe.In addition, Guess? is focused on a brand-elevation strategy, which includes enhancing product quality, visual merchandising and boosting customers’ shopping experience across stores and online. In terms of brand elevation, the company is benefiting from the launch of its global line for all product categories over the last few years. These efforts improve all aspects of design like taste, style, quality and sustainability. Management is also committed to enhancing pricing, marketing campaigns, e-commerce inventory and visual merchandising. Guess? is on track with supply chain and inventory management to counter supply chain disruptions.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHurdles on the WayThe company reported dismal third-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the top and the bottom line declining year over year and the latter falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Guess? posted adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share, down 29%. Earnings were hurt by the negative impact of currency translations. Net revenues amounted to $633.4 million, declining 2% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter. Gross margin contracted 320 basis points to 42.5%, mainly due to unfavorable currency headwinds. In addition, a greater mix of markdowns relative to the year-ago quarter was a concern.Guess? has been battling the adverse impacts of global inflation and softening economic sentiment. In its last earnings call, management highlighted that it expects soft consumer demand and inflationary pressures to continue affecting its fourth-quarter fiscal 2023 results and beyond. In addition, adverse impacts of unfavorable foreign currency rates are hurdles on the way. For the fiscal fourth quarter, Guess? Expects revenues to be down almost 3.5% on a reported basis.That said, we believe that the aforementioned upsides are likely to help this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company stay afloat amid such hurdles.GES’s stock has gained 42.3% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 18.1%.Stocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked companies from the Consumer Discretionary sector are Ralph Lauren RL, PVH Corp.

The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at News’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for News What Is News Worth?Good news, investors! News is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $29.64, but it is currently trading at US$19.46 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that News’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will News generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 35% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for News. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since NWSA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NWSA for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy NWSA. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.If you'd like to know more about News as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

The bounce was partially driven by the social-media firm’s announcement that it would slash more than 11,000 jobs, the first major round of layoffs in the company’s history.Yet signs of skepticism abound: Even after the surge, Meta sells for less than half its average price-earnings multiple of the past decade and is one of the cheapest stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index. Its shares are still 64% below their 2021 record and analysts on average expect the stock to gain a mere 7.7% over the next 12 months.The problem, from the bears’ perspective, is that Meta’s expensive bet on the metaverse — an immersive virtual world — isn’t going away any time soon and will account this year for a fifth of all costs. And its once-lucrative ad business is stagnating because of changes in Apple Inc.’s privacy policy that makes it more difficult to target consumers with ads on its devices.READ: Facebook’s Meta to Keep Investing in Reality Labs Next YearThe metaverse will keep the company’s expenses “relatively high,” said Louise Dudley, global equities portfolio manager at Federated Hermes. “There’s a lot of execution risk at Meta, making it a less of a bull case compared to the other mega-caps.”For the rally to go further, Meta might need to offer investors more clarity on some things, including its strategy to tackle competition from social media rivals such as Tiktok.Story continuesPerhaps more crucially, investors will want to see how much of a squeeze Apple’s privacy policy change is continuing to put on ad revenue. In February, Meta estimated Apple’s move would cause a $10 billion revenue hit for the year.And some Meta bulls hold out hope that Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg will pare further or give up entirely on his ambitions and spending for the metaverse. His hand may be forced by the looming economic slowdown, which is curbing sales at tech companies.“This pressure on revenue growth may cause some of the tech companies we invest in to stop behaving as though money is free and halt some of the less promising projects outside their core business,” Terry Smith, manager of the $28 billion Fundsmith Equity Fund, wrote in a letter to investors this month, specifically citing Meta’s spending.“Without that spend we would own a leading communications and digital advertising business on a single-figure price-earnings ratio,” he wrote.A test will come Feb. 1 when Meta reports fourth-quarter earnings. Analysts have slashed their average expectations for adjusted earnings per share by 27% and for revenue by 15% over the last six months, according to Bloomberg data.Still, there are plenty of bulls. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co.’s Doug Anmuth last month upgraded his recommendation on Meta to overweight from neutral, noting cheap valuations. And among investors polled by JPMorgan this month, 41% said they expected Meta to be the top-performing megacap internet stock of 2023.Sylvia Jablonski, chief investment officer of Defiance ETFs, said Meta appeared to have recognized that shifting focus back to its ad business would be strategically better than throwing all of its eggs into the metaverse basket. This is “a welcome balance for investors,” she said.Tech Chart of the DayTesla Inc. shares are up 3%, on track to reverse monthly losses. If the rebound holds, the stock will snap a five-month streak of declines.

Many more businesses will soon be able to access some of the most advanced AI models in the world created by American research lab OpenAI, including:Read more3 ways to reduce invisible labor for women at work36 ways to build a family-friendly cultureGPT-3.5, a dialogue-based chatbot whose full form extends to Generative Pre-trained Transformer;Codex, which turns natural language into code;DALL•E 2, which can create realistic images and art from a description in natural language).“Customers will also be able to access ChatGPT—a fine-tuned version of GPT-3.5 that has been trained and runs inference on Azure AI infrastructure—through Azure OpenAI Service soon,” Eric Boyd, corporate vice president of AI Platform, wrote in a blogpost.ChatGPT, in OpenAI’s words“We’ve trained a model called ChatGPT which interacts in a conversational way.

Rumor has it that the chatbot could answer some search queries rather than just showing a list of links. It’s in line with Microsoft’s December announcement, planning to introduce a DALL-E 2 image generator in Bing. However, Google has LAMda—the AI chatbot that got an engineer fired for thinking it was too sentient. The LAMda chatbot can talk about a topic, make to-do lists to carry out tasks, and even construct imaginary scenarios like what’s it like to live on a marshmallow planet.💻 Microsoft is looking at adding OpenAI’s tools to everyday apps like PowerPoint, Outlook and other apps, wherein customers will be able to automatically generate text using simple prompts. But of course, wider usage requires the disclaimer that the chatbot comes with its pros and cons. While its ethics and morals seem to be largely in place and it works quickly, there are shortcomings, like getting overwhelmed with too much information and failing to keep up with current affairs.Quotable: ChatGPT can replicate humans, not replace themChatGPT can’t code as well as human coders. Not only because it gets confused sometimes, but also because coders don’t operate in online siloes—they have to understand and solve complex business problems. There’s also copyright issues to consider when the chatbot is doing a writer or an artist’s job. And above all else, the human touch would be lost.“Songs arise out of suffering, by which I mean they are predicated upon the complex, internal human struggle of creation and, well, as far as I know, algorithms don’t feel. Data doesn’t suffer. ChatGPT has no inner being, it has been nowhere, it has endured nothing, it has not had the audacity to reach beyond its limitations, and hence it doesn’t have the capacity for a shared transcendent experience, as it has no limitations from which to transcend. ChatGPT’s melancholy role is that it is destined to imitate and can never have an authentic human experience, no matter how devalued and inconsequential the human experience may in time become.” —Australian singer-songwriter Nick Cave, reacting to a song ChatGPT wrote “in the style of Nick Cave”One more thing: AI gets creepierAccording to a new research paper, a new AI called VALL-E “can be used to synthesize high-quality personalized speech with only a 3-second enrolled recording of an unseen speaker as an acoustic prompt.” In simple terms, it can realistically mimic human speech based on just 3-second samples. The tech draws from an audio library called LibriLight, assembled by Meta, which has 7,000 people talking for a total of 60,000 hours.This could not only put people like voice artists out of work, it could also be misused to run scams where the online system poses as friends, relatives, bank personnel, and more. The researchers themselves admit to perils like “spoofing” and “impersonating” in the paper, suggesting the next step is to build a detection system to ward off these risks.More from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

The tech works by learning from vast amounts of data how to answer any prompt by a user in a human-like way, offering information like a search engine would or prose like an aspiring novelist.Executives have floated wide-ranging applications for the nascent technology, from use as a programming assistant to a step forward in the global race for AI and military supremacy.Conference goers with a major stake in the development of the technology include Microsoft Corp, whose chief executive, Satya Nadella, said the tech's progress has not been linear.AI capabilities will ""completely transform"" all of Microsoft's products, he said in an on-stage interview with the Wall Street Journal.Microsoft has a $1 billion investment in San Francisco-based OpenAI that it has looked at increasing, Reuters has reported. In an announcement that coincided with the conference, Microsoft said it plans to market ChatGPT to its cloud-computing customers. The company has also worked to add OpenAI's image-generation software to its Bing search engine in a new challenge to Alphabet Inc's Google.Later on Tuesday, the political sphere gets to weigh in on the craze. French politician Jean-Noël Barrot planned to join a panel discussion with a Sony Group Corp executive on the technology's impact.Matthew Prince, CEO of Cloudflare Inc, a company that defends websites against cyberattacks and offers other cloud services, sees generative AI as good enough to be a junior programmer or a ""really good thought partner.""Story continuesIn an interview, Prince said Cloudflare was using such technology to write code on its Workers platform. Cloudflare is also exploring how such tech can answer inquiries faster for its free-tier customers as well, he said on the annual meeting's sidelines.Alex Karp, CEO of Palantir Technologies Inc, a software provider helping governments visualise an army's movements or enterprises vet their supply chains, among other tasks, said such AI could have military applications.Karp told Reuters in Davos, ""The idea that an autonomous thing could generate results is basically obviously useful for war.""The country that advances the fastest in AI capabilities is ""going to define the law of the land,"" Karp said, adding that it was worth asking how tech would play a role in any conflict with China.Businesses including CarMax Inc have already used Microsoft and OpenAI's tech, such as to generate thousands of customer review summaries when marketing used vehicles. Proposed venture-capital investment has also exceeded what some startups want to take.Such buzz carried through gatherings at Davos, like talk about a slide-generating bot dubbed ChatBCG after the management consulting firm. The service said on its website that it had too much demand to keep operating.Generative AI is ""a game-changer that society and industry need to be ready for,"" stated an article on the World Economic Forum's website.

Though price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) valuation tools are more commonly used for stock selection, the price-to-book ratio (P/B ratio) is also an easy-to-use metric for identifying low-priced stocks with high-growth prospects.The P/B ratio, sometimes called the market-to-book ratio, is used to calculate how much an investor needs to pay for each dollar of the book value of a stock. It is calculated by dividing the current closing price of the stock by the latest quarter's book value per share.P/B ratio = market capitalization/book value of equityThe P/B ratio helps to identify low-priced stocks that have high growth prospects. Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft DB, Signet Jewelers SIG, Unum Group UNM, Hersha Hospitality Trust HT and Sterling Infrastructure STRL are some such stocks.Now let us understand the concept of book value.What’s Book Value?Book value is the total value that would be left over, according to the company’s balance sheet, if it goes bankrupt immediately. In other words, this is what shareholders would theoretically receive if a company liquidates all its assets after paying off all its liabilities.It is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from the total assets of a company. In most cases, this equates to the common stockholders’ equity on the balance sheet. However, depending on the company’s balance sheet, intangible assets should also be subtracted from the total assets to determine book value.Understanding P/B RatioBy comparing the book value of equity to its market price, we get an idea of whether a company is under-or overpriced. However, like P/E or P/S ratio, it is always better to compare P/B ratios within industries.A P/B ratio of less than one means that the stock is trading at less than its book value, or the stock is undervalued and, therefore a good buy. Conversely, a stock with a ratio greater than one can be interpreted as being overvalued or relatively expensive.Story continuesFor example, a stock with a P/B ratio of 2 means that we pay $2 for every $1 of book value. Thus, the higher the P/B, the more expensive the stock.But there is a caveat. A P/B ratio of less than one can also mean that the company is earning weak or even negative returns on its assets or that the assets are overstated, in which case the stock should be shunned because it may be destroying shareholder value. Conversely, the stock’s price may be significantly high — thereby pushing the P/B ratio to more than one — in the likely case that it has become a takeover target, a good enough reason to own the stock.Moreover, the P/B ratio isn't without limitations. It is useful for businesses — like finance, investments, insurance, and banking or manufacturing companies — with many liquid/tangible assets on the books. However, it can be misleading for firms with significant R&amp;D expenditure, high debt, service companies, or those with negative earnings.In any case, the ratio is not particularly relevant as a standalone number. One should analyze other ratios like P/E, P/S and debt to equity before arriving at a reasonable investment decision.Screening ParametersPrice to Book (common Equity) less than X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.Price to Sales less than X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how much the market values every dollar of the company’s sales/revenues — a lower ratio than the industry makes the stock attractive.Price to Earnings using F(1) estimate less than X-Industry Median: The P/E ratio (F1) values a company based on its current share price relative to its estimated earnings per share — a lower ratio than the industry is considered better.PEG less than 1: PEG links the P/E ratio to the future growth rate of the company. The PEG ratio portrays a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and investors need to pay less for a stock that has bright earnings growth prospects.Current Price greater than or equal to $5: They must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than or equal to 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Zacks Rank less than or equal to #2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score equal to A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a Value Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2, offer the best opportunities in the value investing space.Here are our five picks out of the eight stocks that qualified the screening:Headquartered in Frankfurt am Main, Deutsche Bank Aktiengesellschaft, also called Deutsche Bank AG, is the largest bank in Germany and one of the largest financial institutions in Europe and the world, as measured by total assets.

Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Signet Jewelers Limited SIG, NRG Energy, Inc. NRG, Unum Group UNM and Sterling Infrastructure STRL  boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:Signet, the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

CAG, Signet Jewelers Ltd. SIG, CMS Energy Corp. CMS and Coherent Corp. COHR.4 Stocks with Robust Sales Growth for Assured Returns in 2023As the year 2022 ended on a grim note, it's time for investors to re-assess their portfolio and investment strategy for 2023. While the recent economic data point to some effectiveness of the Federal Reserve's ultra-aggressive monetary tightening, we are still not out of the woods. The central bank is expected to keep interest rates high till inflation comes down reasonably.This has made investors cautious, as higher rates will likely lead to a recession/economic slowdown in 2023. Therefore, a conventional stock-picking strategy is the need of the hour. One such way is selecting stocks with steady sales growth. In this regard, stocks like Conagra Brands, Inc., Signet Jewelers Ltd., CMS Energy Corp. and Coherent Corp. are worth considering.While evaluating any company, revenues are often more scrutinized than earnings. This is because investors want to make sure that a business has the capability of generating more sales over time to cater to an expanding customer base. Steady or declining sales growth reflects obstacles at the company. Stagnant companies may generate profit in the near term but do not ensure enough growth to attract new investors.Without robust revenue growth, bottom-line improvement may not be sustainable. While a company can show earnings strength by lowering costs, continued bottom-line expansion usually requires strong sales growth.Yet, sales growth alone doesn't show much about a company's prospects. Hence, taking into account a company's cash position along with its sales number can be a practical investment strategy. Substantial cash in hand and a steady cash flow give a company more flexibility with respect to business decisions and potential investments.Story continuesHere are four of the 13 stocks that qualified the screening:Chicago-based Conagra Brands is one of the leading branded food companies in North America. CAG offers premium edible products with a refined focus on innovation.Conagra Brands' expected sales growth rate for fiscal 2023 is 6.8%.

But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) share price has soared 258% in the last half decade. Most would be very happy with that. On top of that, the share price is up 14% in about a quarter. But this move may well have been assisted by the reasonably buoyant market (up 8.6% in 90 days).So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress. Check out our latest analysis for Synopsys While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During five years of share price growth, Synopsys achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 48% per year. This EPS growth is higher than the 29% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems the market isn't so enthusiastic about the stock these days. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 51.54, the market remains optimistic.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Synopsys has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Synopsys will grow revenue in the future.A Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that Synopsys shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 2.1% over the last year. Having said that, the five-year TSR of 29% a year, is even better. Potential buyers might understandably feel they've missed the opportunity, but it's always possible business is still firing on all cylinders.

The twin agreements with its two different labor groups brings some relief to the low-cost airline at a time when it is grabbing headlines for wrong reasons --- massive flight cancellations.Southwest Airlines has 200 plus flight instructors who provide classroom instruction for flight operations and simulator training to pilots (current as well as newly hired ones). The flight instructors are represented by Transport Workers Union Local 557. They reached a tentative agreement with LUV last month.On being put to vote, a high majority of the instructors voted in favor of the deal. Expressing delight at the development, LUV’s Vice President Labor Relations Adam Carlisle said,  ""I'm very pleased we're able to acknowledge the important work of our Flight Instructors and implement pay increases and quality of life enhancements"" .The other positive labor-related update at LUV came when the union (Aircraft Mechanics Fraternal Association or AMFA) representing its facilities maintenance technicians, reached a tentative pay-related agreement with the Dallas-based carrier. The fifty facilities maintenance technicians help to maintain, modify and repair all facilities across the system. Per Carlisle ""Our Facilities Maintenance Technicians play an integral role in Southwest's ability to provide great Customer Service"".However, the new contract still has a long way to go before it becomes effective. The tentative agreement does not necessarily mean that the deal will be operational. AMFA will now inform the members about its details and the ratification process, which will follow in the coming days. The provisional deal will become effective only after successful ratification (i.e. the outcome of the voting procedure is favorable).Story continuesZacks Rank &amp; Key PicksSouthwest Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Some better-ranked stocks in the Zacks Airline industry are American Airlines AAL and Gol Linhas GOL , both currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

79,776b37aa-563a-3845-812a-f1f2cf683463,LUV,2023-01-17,Are Clear Skies Ahead for Southwest Airlines?,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clear-skies-ahead-southwest-airlines-213144032.html,1673645504,STORY,['LUV'],"[Editor’s Note: The stock market will be closed next Monday, January 16, for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. The InvestorPlace offices and customer service department also be closed on Monday. We hope you enjoy the long holiday weekend!The holidays are over, and with them, holiday travel. But Southwest Airlines Co. (NYSE:LUV) is still facing turbulent times after its holiday travel meltdown.As you may know, severe weather covered much of the country in multiple feet of snow over the Christmas holiday and caused large scale flight cancellations. Chicago and Denver – where the winter storm hit especially hard – have two of Southwest’s biggest hubs, the Chicago Midway airport and Denver International airport.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, due to nature and bad luck, Southwest became the holidays’ most-affected U.S. airline for flight cancellations, with 16,700 flights cancelled between December 21 and December 31. The airlines cancelled about two-thirds of its flights the week after Christmas, more than other major airlines.So, why was Southwest hit so hard?Well, the weather exacerbated problems that Southwest has already been having. Southwest is a low-cost carrier, meaning that it provides the lowest prices for the most popular routes. It therefore tends to be cheaper than the Big Three airlines, American Airlines Group Inc. (AAL), Delta Air Lines, Inc. (DAL) and United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (UAL).To help make up for the holiday fiasco, Southwest last week announced that it would offer 25,000 Rapid Rewards points – about a $300 value – to travelers whose flights were cancelled or delayed for more than three hours between December 24 and January 2. Passengers who rebooked with Southwest are also eligible for the 25,000 frequent-flier points. The points will never expire and do not have blackout dates.The rewards points come with their own issues, though, as the cost of a flight changes depending on the week and time of year. So, while some travelers may have the full cost of a new ticket covered, others may not. The points also do not cover other expenses that stranded passengers incurred, such as replacing toiletries and other essentials.Story continuesUnfortunately for Southwest, this travel meltdown will cost the airline about $725 million and $825 million. The carrier expects half of the cost to come from revenue lost from cancelled flights and the remaining amount to come from customer reimbursements, the value of 25,000 Rapid Rewards points, and overtime pay for employees.This spells bad news for Southwest’s near-term fundamentals, as Executive Vice President &amp; Chief Commercial Officer Ryan Green said there “will certainly be an impact to the fourth quarter.” President &amp; Chief Executive Officer Bob Jordan, however, was a bit more optimistic: “We have a 51-year history of doing really well, operating really well,” he said. “This one event, which is significant, won’t define us.”We’ll find out more about how Southwest’s numbers stack up when it releases its fourth-quarter earnings on January 26. And even though the report does not come out for two more weeks, I want to flag the company for you now, as the analyst community significantly slashed its earnings estimates in the past week.Earnings estimates had been steadily increasing over the past 90 days. In fact, from 90 to 30 days ago, earnings estimates were revised 45% higher, up from $0.56 per share to $0.81 per share. However, following the holiday flight fiasco, earnings estimates plummeted a whopping 84% from $0.62 per share to $0.10 per share in the past seven days.The fact that analysts cut their earnings estimates is a red flag, as downward revisions mean that earnings misses could be in the cards. And disappointing earnings results could hit the stock.With that in mind, let’s see how the company stacks up in Portfolio Grader.Portfolio Grader report card that shows Southwest has a C rating.As you can see in the Report Card above, Southwest holds a C-rating, making it a “Hold” right now.The reality is that the company isn’t out of the woods – or clouds – just yet. On Wednesday morning, an outage of a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) alert system caused widespread flight groundings.The FAA’s Notice to Air Missions, or NOTAM, system alerts pilots to conditions that could affect the safety of their flights. These messages could include anything from lights being out on a runway to an airshow taking place nearby. NOTAM is a national system, meaning that flights across the country were grounded before they were cleared to fly again shortly before 9:00 a.m. Eastern time.And with flights again affected, so were the airlines.According to FlightAware, a website that tracks real-time flight statuses, there were 8,672 flight delays and 1,268 cancellations as of late Wednesday afternoon.  Of these, Southwest had nearly 2,000 delayed flights and over 400 cancelled fights.Following the announcement of the outage, Southwest fell 2.3% before the opening bell on Wednesday. American Airlines, United and Delta also slipped lower on the news, down, 0.5%, 0.05%, and 0.3%, respectively.Now, looking longer term, I do expect Southwest to recover. It is a very efficient airline, and I have never had a problem with the carrier since I predominately book direct flights. For the near term, though, I wouldn’t put new money into LUV shares until after the skies have cleared and analysts are more bullish on the company again.You might be wondering then – what stocks are set to soar?As I’ve mentioned before, I expect energy stocks to reveal the strongest earnings growth for the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 in the upcoming weeks – and as such, these stocks should lead the market higher in the upcoming weeks and months.Consider this: While the analyst community came back from their ski vacations and lowered earnings estimates for 10 of the 11 S&amp;P 500 sectors, earnings estimates for the energy sector have increased. The energy sector is now expected to post 62.7% average earnings growth for the fourth quarter, compared to previous estimates for 60.8%.Given that the energy sector will post the best earnings results in the upcoming fourth-quarter earnings season, our Breakthrough Stocks Buy List is already heavily weighted in energy stocks.This week, another small-cap energy stock hit my screens and I added it to my Breakthrough Stocks Buy List yesterday. The company is set to release its fourth-quarter earnings results in early February, with earnings expected to more than double in the most recent quarter and analysts increasing earnings estimates in the past three months.If you want to join me at Breakthrough Stocks today and get my latest energy stock recommendation, click here.

80,91b3d34c-dbec-3189-910e-42b68e90282e,PM,2023-01-17,7 Dividend-Paying Large-Cap Stocks to Buy in January,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-dividend-paying-large-cap-131929966.html,1673615969,STORY,"['USB', 'UPS', 'BMY', 'DOW', 'USB-PQ', 'PM', 'F']","[With the markets likely to stay volatile during 2023, playing defensively remains a solid strategy to ride out this tough investing environment. One way you can implement such a strategy is by increasing your exposure to dividend-paying large-cap stocks.If you’re seeking safe harbors, plus the opportunity for long-term capital growth, these types of stocks fit the bill. The companies in this category are by-and-large venerable, established enterprises. They are well-positioned to continue paying out their current dividends, perhaps even increasing their payouts.These payouts provide a steady baseline of returns, in up and down markets. Beyond their appeal as income plays, these stocks also offer strong appreciation potential, when the stock begins to make a recovery.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, what are the best dividend-paying large-cap stocks to buy right now? Consider taking a closer look at these seven. Each of these stocks has a forward dividend yield of at least 3%, offering gradual growth potential over a long time frame.BMYBristol-Myers Squibb$71.60DOWDow Inc.$58.52FFord$13.43PMPhilip Morris International$101.44UPSUnited Parcel Service$182.95USBU.S. Bancorp$47.59VZVerizon Communications$41.81Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY)Bristol-Myers (BMY) logo at the top of a cellphone.Source: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for yield, value, and growth, Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) is a great choice. Currently, this large-cap pharma stock sports a forward dividend yield of 3.2%. With six years of consecutive dividend growth, BMY has increased its payout by an average of 6.88% annually over the past five years.Indeed, BMY stock is arguably undervalued. Shares trade for just 9.4-times forecasted earnings for 2022. That’s slightly lower than other large-cap pharma stocks, which trade for between 10- and 15-times forward earnings. This valuation may also be too low, given the company’s projected future earnings growth.Story continuesAccording to UBS analyst Keith Parker, Bristol-Myers Squibb is expected to report compounded annual earnings per share (or EPS) growth of 13% over the next three years. Even if BMY maintains its current multiple, shares could still steadily climb higher, in tandem with higher earnings.Dow Inc. (DOW)Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comIf you’re looking for one of the dividend-paying large-cap stocks with higher yields, consider Dow Inc. (NYSE:DOW). Shares in this chemicals company have a forward dividend yield of 5%. Yes, this company has not raised its dividend since it was spun off from DuPont (NYSE:DD) in 2019.However, with a payout ratio of only 35.4%, its 70 cent per share quarterly payout is likely sustainable. Along with an above-average dividend yield, DOW stock also trades for just 8.8-times estimated 2022 earnings. Although earnings are expected to drop in 2023, even when you take this into account, DOW remains more-than reasonably-priced, at 13.1-times forward earnings.Furthermore, if energy prices (which have pressure on Dow’s margins) ease during 2023, the company’s earnings could come in ahead of expectations. With all this in mind, high-yield, low-priced DOW stock is a great choice for value-minded investors.Ford (F)Ford logo badge on grill of carSource: JuliusKielaitis / Shutterstock.comAs a recession looms, you may be questioning the merits of buying Ford (NYSE:F) stock today. However, while the post-pandemic boom times for automakers are now in the rearview mirror, and excitement over this “old school” car company’s move into electric vehicles (or EVs) has waned, Ford is still worthy of a buy.Why? First, even if earnings drop this year, they’ll likely be sufficient to maintain Ford’s current dividend, which was reinstated in 2021. Sell-side forecasts call for EPS of $1.71. The company’s current payout is 15 cents per quarter, or 60 cents per year (giving F stock a 4.5% forward yield).Also, despite fading “EV mania,” the vehicle electrification trend isn’t going away. Reporting strong EV sales during 2022, as it continues to successfully increase its presence in this fast-growing area of the auto market, excitement for F stock could rev back up again.Philip Morris International (PM)An image of a cigarette and an e-cigarette side-by-side on a wood surface.Source: vfhnb12 / Shutterstock.comPhilip Morris International (NYSE:PM) is the world’s largest publicly-traded cigarette maker by market cap. However, Philip Morris, whose legacy business is the non-U.S. operations of its former corporate parent, Altria Group (NYSE:MO), is embracing a smoke-free future.That is, the Marlboro maker has made major progress bringing out non-combustible tobacco products, namely its IQOS heated tobacco product. PM is also increasing its exposure to the smokeless tobacco and nicotine products segment of the industry, with its purchase of Swedish Match (OTCMKTS:SWMAY).The company’s aggressive moves to adapt to changing tobacco use trends could help it sustain (and continue to grow) its high dividend. PM stock currently has a forward yield of 5%, and a 14-year track record of dividend growth. Since the spinoff from Altria in 2008, Philip Morris has raised its quarterly dividend by more than 235%, from 54 cents to $1.27.United Parcel Service (UPS)Close up of UPS logo printed on a delivery truck; partial view of the driver sitting at the wheel, waiting at a red traffic light in south San Francisco baySource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.comUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) shares have floundered over the past year. This makes sense, given the challenging and uncertain economic climate. However, with shares in the package transportation company trading for only 14.7-times estimated 2023 earnings, the impact of an economic slowdown may already be baked into its valuation.As InvestorPlace‘s Alex Sirois recently argued, UPS remains a dominant company in the logistics industry, with a strong future. Once there’s an economic and stock market comeback, UPS stock will more-than-likely make a comeback as well. In the meantime, you can be paid to wait for a rebound, via UPS’s 3.3% dividend.While not the highest yield among the dividend-paying large-cap stocks, UPS has a solid dividend growth track record. The company has raised its payout 13 years in a row. Over the past five years, UPS’s dividend has gone up by an average of 12.86% annually.U.S. Bancorp (USB)A pink piggy bank wearing a grad cap sits on a wooden table in front of a chalkboard.Source: ShutterstockU.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) is one of America’s largest financial institutions. Like other bank stocks, worries about the economy have put pressure on shares over the past year.However, USB stock has been trending higher more recently, and it could keep climbing. If recession worries ease, and higher interest rates result in earnings growth in 2023 (as expected per sell-side forecasts), investors could continue to dive back into the stock. Increased profitability resulting from higher interest rates is also a big positive when it comes to future dividend growth.USB already has a fairly high dividend. At current prices, the stock’s forward yield comes in at 4%. However, if earnings keep climbing, so too could USB’s quarterly payout. U.S. Bancorp raised its dividend by 13.5% in 2019, and by 9.5% in 2021. A similarly-sized increase may be in the cards this year.Verizon Communications (VZ)5G stocks, VZ stockSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comIt’s not inaccurate to say that telecom stocks like Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) have been “dividend traps” over the past year. A 6.2% payout (VZ’s forward yield) doesn’t look too appealing, when you weigh it against the stock’s 22.1% price decline over the past year.But while VZ stock has generated negative total returns over the past twelve months, things could play out a whole lot differently moving forward. In fact, shares in this major telecom company have already begun to bounce back, making a double-digit move higher in the past month, thanks to promising statements about subscriber growth made by CEO Hans Vestberg.Trading at a heavily-discounted 8.1-times estimated 2022 earnings, if Verizon can deliver better-than-expected results, shares could continue to climb back near prior price levels. Even a partial recovery, coupled with its high-yield payout, could produce fantastic total returns in 2023, for investors buying today.On the date of publication, Thomas Niel held MO.

A stock's share value is proportional to its contribution to the index, in contrast to the market capitalization-weighted S&amp;P 500.Goldman Sachs posted its biggest one-day percentage drop since a year ago in January.Also weighing on the blue-chip Dow index was insurer Travelers Cos Inc, which fell 4.60% after forecasting fourth-quarter earnings below estimates.But a 7.43% jump in Tesla helped keep the Nasdaq afloat after recent price cuts the company made on its top-selling models, data from China Merchants Bank International showed.Tesla was the largest percentage gainer on both the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq 100.Story continuesThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 391.76 points, or 1.14%, to 33,910.85 and the S&amp;P 500 lost 8.12 points, or 0.20%, to 3,990.97. The Nasdaq Composite added 15.96 points, or 0.14%, to 11,095.11.The Dow snapped a four-session win streak, while the Nasdaq notched its seventh straight gain, its longest streak since November 2021.Volume on U.S. exchanges was 11.11 billion shares.Morgan Stanley rose 5.91% after it beat analysts' estimates for fourth-quarter profit as its trading business got a boost from market volatility.Analysts expect year-over-year earnings from S&amp;P 500 companies to decline 2.4% for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data, compared with a 1.6% decline at the start of the year.Data showed New York state manufacturing contracted sharply in January as orders collapsed and employment growth stalled, pointing to continued weakness in national factory activity, fueling recession concerns.Equity markets have posted a strong start to the year after a dismal 2022, on hopes easing inflation and a slowdown most notably in the labor market would allow the Federal Reserve to pare the size of interest rate hikes it is using to combat high prices.Money market participants are currently expecting a 25-basis point interest rate hike from the U.S. central bank on Feb. 1 and see rates peaking at 4.9% in June and then falling. The Fed projects rates will be more than 5% into next year.U.S.-listed shares of Chinese companies declined, with JD.Com Inc down 5.72% and Baidu Inc off 6.02% after China's economic growth in 2022 slumped to one of its worst levels in nearly half a century.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.17-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.07-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&amp;P 500 posted 14 new 52-week highs and one new low; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 118 new highs and 11 new lows.(Reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak, editing by Deepa Babington)]"

Shares of both banks were down about 0.8% in premarket trading.Their results will follow those of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co and Bank of America Corp, which beat quarterly earnings estimates last week.Wells Fargo &amp; Co and Citigroup Inc earnings, though, fell short of expectations, with most big Wall Street lenders putting away rainy-day funds to prepare for a possible recession.Analysts expect year-over-year earnings from S&amp;P 500 companies to decline 2.2% for the quarter, according to Refinitiv data as of Friday.The S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq indexes closed at one-month highs on Friday, with the former up 4.2% so far in 2023.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 84% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Last week’s 4.1% gain means that institutional investors were on the positive end of the spectrum even as the company has shown strong longer-term trends. The gains from last week would have further boosted the one-year return to shareholders which currently stand at 58%.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Schlumberger. See our latest analysis for Schlumberger ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Schlumberger?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Schlumberger already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Schlumberger's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Schlumberger is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 8.7% of shares outstanding. BlackRock, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.6% of common stock, and State Street Global Advisors, Inc. holds about 6.4% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 20 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of SchlumbergerWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Schlumberger Limited in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$150m of stock. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 16% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Schlumberger better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Schlumberger  that you should be aware of.Ultimately the future is most important.

Its current ratio (a measure of liquidity) was at 2.66 at the end of third-quarter 2022, higher than 2.63 recorded at the end of second-quarter and the prior-year quarter's 2.11.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest In. A holding company is a business entity, usually a corporation or limited liability company, that does not directly manufacture products, offer any services, or carry out any other business operations. Instead, holding companies own controlling stakes in other companies. The main purpose of a holding company is to offer centralized management, and they may also be used for tax or liability purposes. So while it may oversee a subsidiary’s management decisions, a holding company does not actively engage in the daily operations of these subsidiaries.While a holding company structure can be complicated to navigate, it offers multiple benefits including centralized management and control, limited liability, tax relief, flexibility in terms of investment opportunities and diversifying risk, and branding and reputation management. However, holding companies are subject to additional regulations, limited control over the day-to-day operations of their subsidiary companies, dependence on the performance of subsidiary companies, and problems in raising capital. Some of the best holding company stocks to invest in include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A).

MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest In.  Suggested articles:11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy15 Largest Orthopedic Companies in the World11 Undervalued Mid Cap Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest In is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Amgen (AMGN) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.07 a share, just 21 days from its upcoming earnings release on February 6, 2023.AMGN has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.06%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.07 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.02.AMGN is just one of a large group of Medical stocks with a positive ESP figure. Hologic (HOLX) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Hologic, which is readying to report earnings on February 1, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.91 a share, and HOLX is 16 days out from its next earnings report.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hologic is $0.88, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 3.13%.AMGN and HOLX's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.FOMO, or the fear of missing out, also plays a role in investing, particularly with tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Hologic (HOLX) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to HOLX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Hologic's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Hologic's main business drivers.Headquartered in Bedford, MA, Hologic Inc. develops, manufactures, and supplies diagnostics, medical imaging systems and surgical products which cater to the healthcare needs of women.Hologic operates through the following four segments:Diagnostics (55% of total revenues in FY22): With the Gen-Probe acquisition, Hologic currently offers APTIMA family of assays that includes the APTIMA Combo 2 assay, which feature the APTIMA CT and APTIMA GC assays, the APTIMA HPV assay and the APTIMA Trichomonas assay. Other products include the ThinPrep system, primarily used in cytology applications.Breast Health (29% of total revenues in FY22): Products include a broad portfolio of breast imaging and related products and accessories, including digital and film-based mammography systems, computer-aided detection (CAD), breast biopsy guidance systems, minimally invasive breast biopsy and tissue extraction devices and breast brachytherapy products.GYN Surgical (14% of total revenues in FY22): Products include the NovaSure endometrial ablation system – used in the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding and the MyoSure hysteroscopic tissue removal system – which allows incision less removal of fibroids and polyps within the uterus.Skeletal Health (2% of total revenues in FY22): This segment includes dual-energy X-ray bone densitometry systems, an ultrasound-based osteoporosis assessment product, and Fluoroscan mini-C arm imaging products.Story continuesBottom LineWhile anyone can invest, building a lucrative investment portfolio takes research, patience, and a little bit of risk. If you had invested in Hologic ten years ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in January 2013 would be worth $3,577.18, or a gain of 257.72%, as of January 16, 2023, according to our calculations. This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.The S&amp;P 500 rose 171.67% and the price of gold increased 9.90% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are forecasting more upside for HOLX too.Hologic delivered better-than-expected revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. Both molecular diagnostics and surgical businesses grew strong. Excluding COVID impact, molecular diagnostics business grew primarily on more assays being run through the company’s expanded Panther installed base. GYN Surgical business grew nearly 9% organically as the company registered procedural volumes return as well as acceleration from the new business lines. In the past year, Hologic has outperformed its industry. However, on a year-over-year basis, earnings and revenues were significantly down. The significant decline in COVID-19 assay revenues, along with supply chain challenges related to semiconductor chips in the Breast Health business, dragged total revenues down. The company also reported a contraction in both margins.The stock is up 8.44% over the past four weeks, and no earnings estimate has gone lower in the past two months, compared to 2 higher, for fiscal 2022. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

Let’s take a closer look.Net Subscriber AddsThe most critical metric investors will be tracking is the number of subscriber adds throughout the quarter.After all, a declining user base is certainly not what investors want to see.For the quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for net subscriber adds stands at 4.47 million, a nice increase from the prior quarter’s 2.4 million figure. Still, the value reflects a more than 40% decrease from year-ago subscriber adds of 8.3 million in Q4 2021.However, it’s worth mentioning that Netflix has positively surprised on this metric in back-to-back quarters.Quarterly EstimatesAnalysts have had mixed reactions for the quarter to be reported, with two downward and upward earnings estimate revisions hitting the tape. The Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $0.45 suggests a Y/Y decline of roughly 66% in earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe company’s top-line is in better shape; the Zacks Consensus Sales Estimate of $7.8 billion suggests a marginal 1.7% Y/Y uptick in revenue.Quarterly PerformanceNetflix has consistently exceeded bottom line estimates, surpassing the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate in five consecutive quarters by at least 10%.Top line results have primarily been mixed; NFLX has fallen short of revenue estimates in three of its last six quarterly releases. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuationFollowing the rough stretch of price action over the last year, Netflix’s valuation multiples have pulled back extensively; NFLX shares currently trade at a 31.4X forward earnings multiple, a fraction of the 71.1X five-year median.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, the company’s forward price-to-sales ratio has come down to 4.4X, well off the 7.6X five-year median.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPutting Everything TogetherAfter a rough showing throughout the majority of 2022, Netflix NFLX shares have rebounded over the last three months, up more than 30%.In addition, the company’s valuation multiples have cratered, perhaps enticing those with a long-term horizon.Of course, net subscriber adds will be the most closely watched aspect of the entire earnings release, a metric that the company has positively surprised on in back-to-back quarters.Further, analysts have primarily been mixed in their earnings outlook, with estimates indicating a sizable Y/Y pullback in earnings and a slight uptick in revenue.Currently, Netflix is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with an Earnings ESP Score of 21%.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Netflix evolved from an online DVD rental business to the leading streaming service provider with a massive and internationally appealing content portfolio. Netflix currently has over 220 million paid subscribers and $30 billion in annual revenue.But 2022 was not kind to Netflix NFLX. The former darling of Wall Street was at one point down -75% from its all-time high. This fall from grace came after a decade of tremendous performance, with NFLX posting a cumulative stock price appreciation of 2,245% or 37% annualized, even after the correction.That massive correction must have brought some renewed interest though, because after being crushed the stock has rallied 74% off its low over the last six months. NFLX stock is still down 41% over the last 12 months.This leaves Netflix at a potentially pivotal junction and makes its upcoming Q4 earnings report of critical importance. NFLX earnings will be released Thursday January 19th after the market close.Subscriber GrowthNFLX Q1 2022 earnings report brought a dramatic surprise, which initiated the final leg down in the stock’s selloff. During the report, Netflix reported a surprise decline in subscribers. Analysts had projected 2.4 million new subscribers, but the number came back at -200,000. The huge miss also marked Netflix’s first decline in subscribers in nearly a decade.But after that painful quarter, Netflix appeared to be back on track. Netflix beat subscriber growth expectations over the next two quarters and in Q3 NFLX reported subscriber growth of 2.4 million, exceeding the expected 1 million.Not surprisingly, subscriber growth is going to be the primary focus of Thursdays report. Consensus estimates currently forecast subscriber growth for the quarter at 4.5 million. This is a lofty projection, so it may be possible that after two very positive quarters Q4 might not be quite so strong.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStory continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStreaming WarsOne factor that may hinder Netflix’s subscriber growth and business model is the stiff competition brought about by the streaming wars. While Netflix is the leading platform, heavyweights like Apple TV, Amazon Prime, HBO Max, Disney+, Peacock, Hulu, YouTube and even TikTok will continue to draw attention from its subscribers.Disney+ DIS, in particular, is making rapid headway growing its streaming service. Even after launching 12 years later than Netflix, Disney has grown their service to over 160 million subscribers. Disney is aided by its timeless content portfolio and global familiarity of its brands.Still, NFLX is the leader in engagement. Netflix streaming accounts for 7.6% of TV time, 2.6x Amazon prime’s engagement, and 1.4x Disney+ and Hulu combined.Attention is the scarce commodity in this economy and these platforms are going to continue to compete at the highest level to get as much of it as possible.New TierA recent development announced in October 2022 was the expansion of a new subscription plan. Netflix’s new plan will be what it calls “Basic with Ads,” which will cost just $6.99 per month in the US. As the name says, this will be a subscription to Netflix’s content, but will come with regular ads, unlike the typical plans. The standard plan is currently $15.49 per month, and the premium plan is $19.99 per month.There are a few possibilities about why Netflix is adding this new option. It could be that Netflix believes their subscriber growth is plateauing and they need access to a new segment of users.Another possibility is that this new plan is a response to the changing economic environment. With the rapid increase in cost-of-living, content subscriptions have become a luxury, and families that are cutting budgets may decide to forgo their Netflix. But with this option, they will have the option to stay with the service and subsidize the cost by watching occasional ads.Zacks AnalysisNetflix currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), and its industry rank is currently in the bottom 22%. Additionally, while the current quarter sales are expected to grow 1.7% and current year expected up 6.4% YOY, earnings are looking down. Netflix’s Q4 earnings are expected to shrink -66% to $0.45/share, while current year is forecasted down -8% to $10.31/share.The last four reports have seen earnings surprise to the upside, but will it continue? Considering the challenging economic environment, highly competitive streaming landscape, and shifting business model strategy, upside surprises are seeming less and less likely. But that said, Netflix’s most accurate earnings estimates comes in 21% higher than the current Zacks consensus. Therefore, Netflix could, in fact, be poised to beat again on the bottom line.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuationNFLX’s current Price to Sales ratio is 4.8x, which after dipping below the S&amp;P500 average last year, is now back above it. Additionally, at 4.8x it is well below the 10-year median of 7x.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchConclusionNetflix stock is at a major injunction along with the rest of big tech. After a brutal 2022, Thursday’s earnings report will likely provide some very valuable color on what 2023 may hold for markets.Considering NFLX from a long-term perspective, it has of course been a massive winner. While it appears Netflix may have bumped into some macro headwinds, and possible slowing growth it is still a sector leading business. And though the subscriber growth miss seems like it may be the end of an epic run, its possible that it was just a hiccup.What if Netflix is on its way to a 1 billion subscriber business?Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Searches for “Emily in Paris” surged more than 1,000% higher at the same time.The interest sparked by travelers hoping to get an in-person glimpse of Paris as seen in the show has led to a swathe of articles and tours promising to help people step into the shoes of protagonist Emily Cooper.Even Paris’s official tourism website has published articles detailing the best locations in the city for fans of the series to visit.“Irritating” Netflix seriesHowever, David Belliard—the deputy mayor of Paris, who in charge of transforming the city’s public spaces and transport—let loose in an op-ed in French publication Libération on Thursday about his disapproval of the “irritating” Netflix series and its “complete erasure” of climate-related issues, describing the show’s portrayal of Paris as an “urban caricature where the Eiffel Tower is there, in the background, at every street corner.”“What Emily gives us through her wanderings is a snapshot of an unchangeable Paris, a Disneyland, which is confined to the districts of the ultra-center and is inhabited only by the richest people in a uniform architectural heritage. In short, an ‘Instagram Paris’ with impeccable colors and ideal views,” he said.“This fable is neither desirable nor viable... there is the complete erasure of the constraints of climate deregulation and the rarity of resources. We have to get out of nostalgia for a stereotypical city and invent a new aesthetic coherence that is adapted to a changing world.”Story continuesA spokesperson for Netflix was not immediately available for comment when contacted by Fortune.One specific example Belliard gave of “Emily in Paris” prioritizing aesthetics over real issues was the show’s lack of reference to historic heatwaves that have swept across Europe in recent years, which have seen summer temperatures in Paris reaching catastrophic highs.In the series, Emily lives in an attic apartment in Paris’s Latin Quarter. “The flats on the top floors, often occupied by the poorest people, become unbearable ovens in hot weather,” Belliard said in his article on Thursday. “A simple solution... would be to paint the roofs with white reflective paint. But are we ready to abandon the color palette of Paris?”Despite ""Emily in Paris"" being a big hit with Netflix subscribers—season three had racked up 117.6 million viewing hours within a week of its debut, according to Deadline—its reception has been far less warm elsewhere, with critics widely panning the series and French people mocking the show when it was first released.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: Air India slammed for ‘systemic failure’ after unruly male passenger flying business class urinated on a woman traveling from New YorkMeghan Markle’s real sin that the British public can’t forgive–and Americans can’t understand‘It just doesn’t work.’ The world’s best restaurant is shutting down as its owner calls the modern fine dining model ‘unsustainable’Bob Iger just put his foot down and told Disney employees to come back into the office]"

The figure indicates a 66.2% decline from the year-ago quarter.Netflix expects total revenues to increase 0.9% year over year to $7.776 billion. The consensus mark for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $7.84 billion, suggesting 1.67% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.Netflix’s earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 35.09%.Netflix, Inc.

Quote Let’s see how things are shaping up for this announcement.Factors to ConsiderNetflix now expects to gain 4.5 million paid subscribers in fourth-quarter 2022 compared with the year-ago quarter’s addition of 8.28 million.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company expects to end the fourth quarter of 2022 with 227.59 million paid subscribers globally, indicating growth of 2.6% from the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for paid memberships at the end of the period is pegged at 227.42 million, slightly lower than management’s expectation.Netflix’s shares have lost 36.7% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry’s decline of 41.2%.Netflix has been facing stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Disney+ by Disney DIS, HBO Max, Comcast’s CMCSA Peacock, Paramount+, Apple TV+ and Amazon AMZN.Per a recent report by Parks Associates, Netflix has been surpassed by Amazon prime video in terms of its subscriber base in the United States.Netflix’s latest ad-supported service also failed to excite its user base. The ad-supported plan, launched on Nov 3, accounted for only 9% of new Netflix sign-ups in the United States in November.Moreover, Netflix is expected to face competition in the ad-supported streaming market from the likes of Disney and Comcast.Netflix’s closest competitor, Disney, benefits from the growing popularity of Disney+, owing to a strong content portfolio and a cheaper bundle offering.Disney is also expanding into international markets. Disney+, as of Oct 1, 2022, had 164.2 million paid subscribers compared with 118.1 million as of Oct 2, 2021.Comcast’s Peacock also offers a free-to-watch tier with ad support that has about 40,000 hours of content. Peacock is well-poised to grow, owing to its vast library of IPs and new productions.However, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio, attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized, foreign-language content and an expanding international footprint, Netflix is still dominating the streaming market.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for paid total streaming net membership gain is pegged at 4.471 million.Netflix’s growing popularity in the Asia Pacific (APAC) and Latin America (LATAM) regions, thanks to its diversified content offerings in regional languages, is expected to have driven top-line growth.The consensus mark for fourth-quarter 2022 APAC revenues is pegged at $892 million, indicating 2.4% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LATAM revenues is pegged at $996 million, suggesting almost 3.3% growth from the figure reported in the previous quarter.Moreover, the consensus mark for Europe, Middle East &amp; Africa revenues is pegged at $2.31 billion, suggesting an 8.6% decline from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the United States and Canada revenues stands at $3.559 billion, indicating 7.6% growth from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Amgen (AMGN) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $4.07 a share, just 21 days from its upcoming earnings release on February 6, 2023.AMGN has an Earnings ESP figure of 1.06%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $4.07 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.02.AMGN is just one of a large group of Medical stocks with a positive ESP figure. Hologic (HOLX) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Hologic, which is readying to report earnings on February 1, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.91 a share, and HOLX is 16 days out from its next earnings report.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Hologic is $0.88, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 3.13%.AMGN and HOLX's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

105,435dff4a-b384-3d9b-a2cb-9b5fa1ed2f63,NEM,2023-01-17,7 Stocks to Buy and Hold For a Lifetime,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-stocks-buy-hold-lifetime-120445690.html,1673697885,STORY,"['COST', 'CVX', 'NEM', 'LMT', 'AAPL', 'RIO', 'F']","[I always trust the idea of buying and holding quality stocks for the long term. However, with geopolitical, macroeconomic, and technological changes, a part of the portfolio needs to be dynamic. At the same time, there are stocks to buy and hold forever.These stocks represent companies that have a strong balance sheet and robust cash flows. Further, these companies have remained ahead of the curve when it comes to changes and innovation. The result is sustained value creation through dividends and capital gains.It’s also worth mentioning that most of these stocks to buy and hold is low-beta stocks. Amidst market volatility, these stocks offer protection from capital erosion. I would personally allocate at least 40% to 50% of my portfolio toward these stocks. I can also say with some conviction that total returns (dividend and capital gains) from these stocks over the next five to ten years will outperform the index.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these stocks to buy and hold forever.TickerCompanyPriceCVXChevron Corporation$177.56LMTLockheed Martin$449.83COSTCostco Wholesale$485.25RIORio Tinto$77.55AAPLApple$134.76NEMNewmont Corporation$54.35FFord Motor$12.72Chevron Corporation (CVX)Chevron has Put a Priority on Protecting Its Big, Fat DividendSource: Denis Kuvaev / Shutterstock.comChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock is among the top stocks to buy and hold. The oil and gas exploration company was in an uptrend last year, and I expect the positive momentum to sustain. Besides the potential for capital gains, CVX stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.24%.From a fundamental perspective, there are two important reasons to like Chevron. First, the company has an investment-grade balance sheet with a net-debt ratio of 4.9% as of Q3 2022. Further, the company has low break-even assets that enable the generation of robust cash flows.For Q3 2022, Chevron reported an operating cash flow of $13.7 billion. With an annual OCF visibility in excess of $40 billion, Chevron is positioned to make big investments and potentially increase dividends. It’s also worth noting that Chevron has a strong resource base, which implies steady production in the coming years.Story continuesLockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comGlobal defense spending exceeded $2 trillion in 2021. It’s likely that defense spending will continue to increase with several points of geopolitical friction. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock looks attractive and is worth holding in the core portfolio.In the last 12 months, LMT stock has trended higher by 27%, and the stock also offers a dividend yield of 2.59%. As the company’s order backlog swells, it’s likely that investment returns will remain robust. As of Q3 2022, Lockheed reported an order backlog of $140 billion.For the last quarter, Lockheed reported a free cash flow of $2.7 billion. This implies an annualized FCF potential in excess of $10 billion. Therefore, dividend growth is likely to sustain.Lockheed Martin has also been investing in new technology. This is a catalyst for growth over the next decade. The investments include a focus on hypersonics, directed energy, and autonomy, among others. With a strong balance sheet, Lockheed is also positioned for potential acquisitions in the defense space.Costco Wholesale (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) has been sideways to lower in the last 12 months. This was expected, considering inflationary pressure. Further, the stock has discounted the potential impact of aggressive rate hikes on consumer spending.Besides these near-term headwinds, COST stock is worth holding for the coming years. The U.S. economy is primarily consumption-based, and retail spending is a critical component.Another point to note is that sales growth has been healthy even amidst challenges. For the 18 weeks that ended on Jan. 1, Costco reported sales growth of 7.6% on a year-on-year basis to $82.16 billion. The outlook remains positive, with comparable store sales growth being healthy in the U.S.Costco also has 66.9 million households as members. This has translated into $4.3 billion in membership fees in the last 12 months. With continued expansion in the U.S. and internationally, recurring income is likely to swell. This will have a sustained positive impact on cash flows.Rio Tinto (RIO)the rio tinto (RIO) logo on a building during daylightSource: Rob Bayer / Shutterstock.comRio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) looks attractive among commodity stocks to buy and hold forever. The stock has been in an uptrend, with a rally of 35% in the last six months. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 8.8 times, the stock remains a compelling buy. A dividend yield of 9.0% adds to the attractiveness.One reason to like Rio is an investment-grade balance sheet. Further, for the first half of 2022, Rio reported a free cash flow of $7.1 billion. Robust financial flexibility will ensure that dividends sustain. At the same time, Rio is positioned to make big investments to potentially accelerate growth.In December 2022, Rio completed the acquisition of Turquoise Hill Resources for a consideration of $3.1 billion. This boosts the company’s copper portfolio. Rio is also positioned to be the largest source of lithium supply in Europe for the next 15 years. With a global push towards green energy, these base metals will drive growth for Rio Tinto.Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been an underperformer in the last 12 months. During this period, the stock declined by 25%. However, the business is a cash flow machine, and Apple is an innovator. The correction provides a good entry opportunity for the long term.From the sales perspective, the iPhone segment remains the key growth driver. At the same time, the services and wearable segment growth has been encouraging. With product diversification, the growth outlook is positive.Further, Apple has nearly $170 billion in cash and equivalents. With strong operating cash flows, dividend growth will continue along with share repurchases. Also, Apple is positioned to pursue inorganic growth by investing in innovation-driven start-ups.There are reports that Apple has delayed its self-driving car launch until 2026. The company plans to sell consumer models for under $100,000. With a loyal customer base, the launch of the Apple car might be a big growth catalyst.Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockGold has already been trending higher, and there are several long-term catalysts for the precious metal. This includes geopolitical tension, inflation, and a weak dollar. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stock is a good proxy for investing in gold. The gold miner has remained subdued in the last 12 months, with gold remaining sideways to lower. NEM stock is, however, attractive at current levels and offers a dividend yield of 4.12%.Newmont Corporation has an investment-grade balance sheet, and that’s a key reason to like the stock. With strong financial flexibility, the company is positioned to sustain dividends and accelerate investments.Newmont has a strong asset base with 96 million ounces of proven reserves. With investment in exploration activity, reserve replacement has remained strong. The company expects to deliver steady production through 2040.Therefore, even if gold trades around $2,000 an ounce, Newmont will report robust free cash flows. The company expects to lower the all-in-sustaining cost in the coming years. If gold trends are higher, meaningful EBITDA margin expansion can be expected.Ford Motor (F)Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.Source: D K Grove / Shutterstock.comAmong the traditional automakers, Ford (NYSE:F) looks attractive among stocks to buy and hold. Ford has aggressive plans for the transformation of its portfolio towards EVs, and that’s likely to create value.F stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 6.8 times and offers a dividend yield of 3.7%. The downside is capped from current levels, while the upside potential is meaningful.Talking about EV plans, Ford expects to deliver a global capacity of 600,000 EVs by the end of 2023. Further, the company expects 40% to 50% of its global vehicle sales to be EVs by 2030. The company has also been investing in building battery plants to ensure that the supply chain remains smooth.An important point to note is that Ford reported a total liquidity buffer of $49.2 billion as of Q3 2022. With positive free cash flows, the company has ample financial flexibility to make big investments for portfolio transformation.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

These include petroleum products (26.9%), engineering goods (11.9%), gems and jewellery (15.2%), and drugs and pharmaceuticals (1.9%). On the other hand, imports of key items like gold, silver, electronic goods, and project goods also contracted.India’s exports to the US were highest at $59.6 billion in April-December 2022. Others that followed are the UAE, Netherlands, Bangladesh, and Singapore.India should aim to reduce its import billWith the likelihood of a global recession rising in 2023, Indian traders are likely to face more challenges. A part of the problem is that India imports more than it exports, inflating the country’s trade balance.Analysts believe its reliance on crude oil for 80% of its energy requirements must be reduced. “India must re-energize exploration of local oil fields and enhance production through coal mines. Any development will cut the energy import bill substantially and improve the current account,” The Economic Times reported in January, citing the economic think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).Story continuesIndia is estimated to pay $270 billion for coal and crude imports in 2022, accounting for about 40% of its total merchandise bill, GTRI said.India’s commerce ministry is doing a “country-wise as well as commodity-wise” analysis to boost exports, the Financial Times reported today, quoting commerce secretary Sunil Bharthwal.

Deepa's book explores the collective setbacks faced by Women of Color in traditional corporate environments and the need to reshape and level-set for a more diverse and inclusive corporate culture.Sitting down for a fireside chat with Robert Gaudette, EVP of NRG Business, Deepa discussed psychological safety and how lacking this sense of security greatly impacts employees' experience and engagement in the workplace. Sharing real-life anecdotes and extensive research, Deepa provided tremendous insight into the many ways that Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOCs) are both othered and pressured to conform to their work environment.With NRG employees in attendance, both in person and virtually, the conversation delved into topics such as:The complex barriers that prevent employees from feeling psychologically safe in a corporate environmentHow to combat preconceived ideas of what safety meansWhat inroads are needed to foster a safe place where people can truly embrace and share their authentic selvesHow to be an effective ally or ""co-conspirator""As Deepa explained, ""The biggest thing we can do is to realize that people lead differently and that you get the best out of people when they are truly able to bring the best parts of themselves to work.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from NRG Energy on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: NRG EnergyWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/nrg-energyEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: NRG EnergyView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/735360/Our-2022-Day-of-Understanding-Recap]"

Value investing is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. Signet Jewelers Limited SIG, NRG Energy, Inc. NRG, Unum Group UNM and Sterling Infrastructure STRL  boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to its peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the seven stocks that qualified the screening:Signet, the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.While cash flow can come from bond interest or interest from other types of investments, income investors hone in on dividends. A dividend is the distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders; it's often viewed by its dividend yield, a metric that measures a dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends account for significant portions of long-term returns, with dividend contributions exceeding one-third of total returns in many cases.The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation in FocusBased in New York, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (BK) is in the Finance sector, and so far this year, shares have seen a price change of 7.71%. The company is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.37 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.02%. This compares to the Banks - Major Regional industry's yield of 3.2% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.61%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.48 is up 4.2% from last year. In the past five-year period, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation has increased its dividend 4 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 7.78%. Any future dividend growth will depend on both earnings growth and the company's payout ratio; a payout ratio is the proportion of a firm's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Right now, The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation's payout ratio is 33%, which means it paid out 33% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, BK expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $4.63 per share, representing a year-over-year earnings growth rate of 0.87%.Story continuesBottom LineFrom greatly improving stock investing profits and reducing overall portfolio risk to providing tax advantages, investors like dividends for a variety of different reasons. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Big, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. That said, they can take comfort from the fact that BK is not only an attractive dividend play, but is also a compelling investment opportunity with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

And welcome to the 2022 Fourth Quarter Earnings Conference Call hosted by BNY Mellon . I will now turn the conference over to Marius Merz, BNY Mellon, Head of Investor Relations.

With that, I will turn it over to Robin.Robin Vince: Thank you, Marius. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Before Emily takes you through our quarterly results, I'd like to make a few broader comments on our performance in 2022 and on some areas of focus for 2023. As you can see on Page 2 of our financial highlights presentation, we reported earnings per share for the full year of $2.90, down 30% compared to the prior year and a return on tangible common equity of 13%. Excluding the impact of notable items, we reported earnings per share of $4.59, which was up 8% year-over-year and a return on tangible common equity of 21%, reflecting our solid underlying performance against the backdrop of a complex operating environment in 2022. Our results this year included several notable items.Story continuesFor example, those related to Russia in the first quarter and the goodwill impairment related to investment management in the third quarter. And our fourth quarter results reflect the impact of a number of decisions that we made to improve our revenue growth and efficiency trajectory moving forward. Excluding notable items, revenues grew a little faster than expenses as we continued to see strength in client activity and volumes while continuously positioning ourselves to derive meaningful benefit from the upward move in interest rates. Together, these factors more than offset the stiff headwinds from lower market levels. On the back of organic growth in AUCA, we're continuing our role as the world's largest custodian, and we saw cumulative net inflows in assets under management.Beyond the numbers, I'd like to highlight a couple of areas where I'm particularly encouraged by our performance in 2022. First, our sales momentum, which speaks to the strength of our client franchise and our capabilities. In Asset Servicing, we continued to elevate our client dialogue while maintaining a strong focus on service quality to support our clients through a difficult environment. Sales wins increased off a strong 2021 and we're winning larger and higher value deals, which is where the elevation of client dialogue matters. In ETFs, AUCA reached $1.4 trillion as we saw strong net inflows throughout the year and the total number of funds serviced rose by 12%. And in , we grew AUCA by 14% and fund launches were up by over 25%. Treasury Services delivered strong broad based growth throughout 2022.In the fourth quarter, we announced a collaboration with Conduent to be their trusted payments infrastructure provider as they launch a digital integrated payments hub for businesses and the public sector. This hub will enable access to more secure, faster and cost effective options to send, request and receive payments and refunds in a matter of minutes using real time payments and other proven payment technologies. And we also onboarded several new clients during the quarter as we continued to build our digital payments and related FX businesses. And finally, while 2022 was no doubt a difficult environment for the wealth market, our wealth management business acquired more clients with particular strength in the ultra high net worth and family office segments, and we continued to deepen existing relationships through our expanded banking offering where the percentage of advisory clients who also bank with us rose by about 5 percentage points.Notwithstanding the tough backdrop, Pershing, which is, in fact, our largest play as a company in the wealth space, brought in net new assets of over $120 billion, representing 5% growth. In the fourth quarter, we announced to very exciting wins, demonstrating the broad based capabilities that Pershing is uniquely positioned to offer. The first was State Farm, which is an exciting relationship given State Farm's size and reach with its thousands of agents across the country serving tens of millions of households. And we also onboarded Arta Finance, which was founded by a team of former Google executives who are now leading a global digital family office that uses advanced technologies to empower investors with tools to invest intelligently.This win is an important proof point of our proven set of APIs and digital capabilities and demonstrates our ability to win with tech forward clients. The second area of performance, I'll call out is that we continue to forge ahead with our longer-term growth initiatives such as Pershing X, real-time payments, the reimagining of custody and collateral and digital assets. These initiatives will help position the company for the next leg of growth beyond the medium term. We went live with our digital asset custody platform in the US in October. And as I highlighted in my OpEd in the Financial Times a month ago, this will continue to be a focus for us, not so much for crypto but really the broader opportunity that exists across digital assets and distributed ledger technology.If anything, the recent events in the crypto market only further highlight the need for trusted regulated providers in the digital asset space. We are also now live with our first release at Persing X, just one year after launching the initiative. This release to a small number of select clients includes three core products: Portfolio Solutions, including direct indexing; Client Servicing; and Data and Reporting tools. But equally importantly, this release is about our ability to set a goal on a tight timeline and execute. Finally, the third and probably most important highlight of the year for me is our people and our systems, once again, demonstrated remarkable resilience. Across the war in Ukraine, the extraordinary moves we saw in several government debt markets and volume surges, the operational readiness of our people and our systems consistently enabled successful outcomes for our clients.I cannot thank our people enough for their hard work and dedication to serving our clients. While we're proud of these accomplishments, it's also important to humbly recognize an area where we fell short this past year, acknowledging the inflationary headwinds, expense growth for a second straight year was around 5% ex-notables. We consider that number too high, especially considering the expense growth benefited from a stronger US dollar throughout the year. On a constant currency basis, expense growth ex notables was approximately 8%. While I'm encouraged by the renewed sense of urgency across the organization over the last few months to better manage our expenses, we still have a ways to go on this journey, which brings me to our key focus areas for 2023.First, Expenses. My leadership team and I are fully committed to bending the cost curve this year. That will come from instilling further expense discipline across the firm and from focusing more on profitable new business growth, saying no to more things when the economics aren't what they should be. Efficiencies are also going to come from implementing ideas that will make BNY Mellon a simpler, more efficient place to do business with. And so here, we've embarked on an enterprise wide initiative, led by senior leaders and high performing employees from around the world focused on driving greater efficiency and enabling sustainable growth. No one knows the ins and outs of our products, services and processes better than our people. And so all of our staff have had the opportunity to take an active role in this initiative by submitting ideas for how we can run the company in a better way for all our stakeholders.To date, we've approved about 1,500 high quality ideas, of which about 200 are already completed and another 500 are on track to be implemented this year with a meaningful amount of these ideas requiring little upfront investment. Emily will cover this in more detail, but as a result of these initiatives and our renewed determination, we expect to achieve nearly double the amount of efficiency savings this year compared to what we achieved in any of the recent years. But our priorities are, of course, not just about managing expenses. We are also focused on reinvigorating profitable growth. Our project commits to achieving positive underlying growth this year across almost all of our businesses, with particularly healthy growth coming from asset servicing, Pershing and treasury services.We will continue full speed ahead with our critical long term growth investments that I mentioned earlier with clear and specific targets that we expect the teams to hit over the course of the year. Lastly, on the top line, our priorities include goals for our One BNY Mellon program, which incentivizes cross business referrals and development of innovative, multi business solutions that only BNY Mellon's unique collection of businesses is equipped to provide. In 2022, we saw good initial momentum and we surpassed our initial goal for the year, and we intend to deliver a further pickup in 2023 as we increasingly sell our platform and better connect the dots for our clients. Finally, on capital management, I'll highlight that our Board of Directors has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program, which provides us ample flexibility and having ended the year comfortably above our capital management targets, we're now resuming buybacks.And so in summary, while none of us can predict exactly what the operating environment will look like in 2023, we are laser focused on growing the franchise and executing against our efficiency plans with discipline and urgency to drive some positive operating leverage in 2023 while returning a healthy amount of capital to our shareholders this year. With that, let me turn it over one last time to Emily as our CFO.See also 15 Countries that Produce the Most Wind Energy and 21 Biggest Airports in the World.Emily Portney: Thank you, Robin, and good morning, everyone. As I walk you through the details of our results for the quarter, all comparisons will be on a year-over-year basis unless I specify otherwise. Starting on Page 3 of our financial highlights presentation. Total revenue of $3.9 billion in the fourth quarter was down 2% on a reported basis and up 9% excluding notable items. As Robin mentioned earlier and as you can see at the bottom of the page, our reported results in the fourth quarter included a few notable items resulting from actions to improve our revenue and expense trajectory. Reported revenues included approximately $450 million of net securities losses recorded in investments and other revenue, resulting from a previously disclosed repositioning of our securities portfolio, which I will expand upon later.Fee revenue was flat as the benefit of lower money market fee waivers and healthy organic growth across our Security Services and Market and Wealth Services segment was offset by the impact of lower market values from both equity and fixed income markets and the unfavorable impact of a stronger US dollar. Firm wide assets under custody and/or administration of $44.3 trillion declined by 5%. The headwind of lower market values and currency translation was tempered by continued growth from both new and existing clients and assets under management of $1.8 trillion decreased by 25%. This also reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger US dollar. And again, this headwind was partially offset by cumulative net inflows.Investment in other revenue was negative $360 million in the quarter on a reported basis. Excluding notable items, investment in other revenue was a positive $100 million, a good results reflecting another quarter of strong fixed income trading performance. And net interest revenue increased by 56%, primarily reflecting higher interest rates. Expenses were up 8% or 2% excluding notable items. Notable items amounted to approximately $200 million in the quarter, primarily severance expenses and provision for credit losses was $20 million, primarily reflecting changes in the macroeconomic forecast. On a reported basis, EPS was $0.62, pretax margin was 17% and return on tangible common equity was 12%. Excluding the impact of notable items, EPS was $1.30, up 25% year-over-year, pretax margin was 31% and return on tangible common equity was 24%.Touching on the full year on Page 4. Total revenue grew by 3% on a reported basis and by 6%, excluding notable items. Fee revenue was flat. Investment and other revenue was negative $82 million or positive $340 million, excluding notable items and net interest revenue was up 34%. Expenses were up 13% on a reported basis and up 5% excluding notable items, consistent with our goal to drive 2022 expense growth towards the bottom half of the 5% to 5.5% range that we guided to throughout the year. Excluding the benefit from the stronger US dollar, expenses ex notables for the year were up 8%. Provision for credit losses was $39 million compared to a provision benefit of approximately $230 million in the prior year. On a reported basis, EPS was $2.90, pretax margin was 20% and return on tangible common equity was 13%.Excluding the impact of notable items, EPS was $4.59, up 8% year-over-year. Pretax margin was 29% and return on tangible common equity was 21%. On to capital and liquidity on Page 5. Our consolidated Tier 1 leverage ratio was 5.8%, up approximately 35 basis points sequentially, primarily reflecting capital generated through earnings, the sale of Alcentra and an improvement in accumulated other comprehensive income, partially offset by capital returned through dividends. Our CET1 ratio was 11.2%, up approximately 120 basis points, driven by the increase in capital and lower risk weighted assets. And finally, our LCR was 118%, up 2 percentage points sequentially. Turning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on Page 6, which I will also talk about in sequential terms.Net interest revenue of $1.1 billion was up 14% sequentially. This increase primarily reflects higher yields on interest earning assets, partially offset by higher funding costs. Once again, NIR in the quarter exceeded our expectations as noninterest bearing deposits remain elevated. Average positive balances decreased by 2%. Within this, interest bearing deposits increased by 2% and noninterest bearing deposits declined by 11%. Despite this decline in the quarter, the share of noninterest bearing deposits as a percentage of total deposits has held up better than expected at 27%, which is higher than historical averages, and we continue to actively manage our deposit footprint to optimize across NIR, liquidity value and return on capital. Average interest earning assets remained flat.Underneath that, cash and reverse repo increased by 4%. Loan balances were down 1% and our investment securities portfolio was down 3%. As I mentioned, in the fourth quarter, we took actions to reposition the securities portfolio to improve our NIR trajectory for the coming years. We sold roughly $3 billion of longer dated lower yielding municipal and corporate bonds, which we've been replacing with significantly higher yielding securities earning roughly 5% or 250 to 300 basis points more than what we were earning on the securities that we sold. While we realized an approximately $450 million pretax loss with this sale, this transaction was virtually capital neutral because the unrealized loss was already recognized in AOCI. In fact, we freed up roughly $150 million of CET1 capital as the higher credit quality replacement portfolio consumes significantly lower RWA.Moving on to expenses on Page 7. Expenses for the quarter were $3.2 billion, up 8% year-over-year. Excluding notable items, expenses were up 2% year-over-year. This year-over-year increase reflects investments net of efficiency savings, higher revenue related expenses, including distribution expenses as well as the impact of inflation, partially offset by the benefit of the stronger US dollar. Turning to Page 8 for a closer look at our business segment. Security Services reported total revenue of $2.2 billion, up 18% compared to the prior year. Fee revenue increased 2% and net interest revenue was up 79%, driven by higher interest rates, partially offset by lower balances. As I discussed the performance of our Security Services and Market and Wealth Services segment, I will focus my comments on investment services fees for each line of business, which you can find in our financial supplement.In Asset Servicing, investment services fees were down 1% as the impact of lower market values at a stronger US dollar were mostly offset by the abatement of money market fee waivers, higher client activity and net new business. In Issuer services, investment services fees were up 7%, driven by the reduction of money market fee waivers and higher depositary receipt issuance and cancellation fees. Next, market and wealth services on Page 9. Market and Wealth Services reported total revenue of $1.4 billion, up 19%. Fee revenue was up 14% and net interest revenue increased by 33%. In Pershing, investment services fees were up 22%. This increase reflects lower money market fee waivers, higher fees on suite balances and higher client activity, partially offset by the impact of lost business in the prior year and lower market levels.Net new assets were $42 billion, reflecting a very healthy level of growth from existing clients while flows related to dividends and year end capital gain distributions were naturally more muted than in the prior year quarter, and average active clearing accounts were up 4% year-on-year. In Treasury Services, investment services fees were flat. The benefit of lower money market fee waivers and net new business was offset by the negative impact to fees from higher earnings credit on the back of higher interest rates. And in Clearance and Collateral Management, investment services fees were up 6%, primarily reflecting higher US government clearance volumes driven by continued demand for US treasury securities due to elevated volatility and an evolving monetary policy.Now turning to Investment and Wealth Management on Page 10. Investment and Wealth Management reported total revenue of $825 million, down 19%. Fee revenue was down 18% and net interest revenue was up 2%. Assets under management of $1.8 trillion declined by 25% year-over-year. This decrease largely reflects lower market values and the unfavorable impact of the stronger US dollar partially offset by cumulative net inflows. As it relates to flows in the quarter, we saw $6 billion of net outflows from long term products and $27 billion of net inflows into cash. Among our long term active strategy, liability driven investments continued to be a bright spot with $19 billion of net inflows in the quarter, a real testament to our market leading capabilities and resilient performance during the recent market dislocation, a very healthy net inflows into our cash strategies come on the back of strong investment performance, most notably in our drives money market fun.In Investment Management, revenue was down 22% due to lower market value, and mix of cumulative net inflows, a stronger US dollar and the sale of Alcentra partially offset by lower money market fee waivers. And finally, in Wealth Management, revenue was down 12%, primarily reflecting lower market values. Client assets of $269 million were down 16% year-over-year, primarily driven by lower market value. Page 11 shows the results of the Other segment where investment in other revenue includes the net loss and the repositioning of the securities portfolio and expenses include severance. Now let me close with a few comments on how we're thinking about 2023. With regards to NIR, we have positioned ourselves for another year of healthy growth. And so we currently project an approximately 20% year-over-year increase for the full year and that assumes current market implied interest rates.Having said that, the range of potential outcomes remains relatively wide and the quarterly trajectory of NIR will be dependent on various factors, including the path of deposit levels and mix as well as interest rates. As it relates to fees, as you know, market driven factors like equity and fixed income market levels, currency and industry dominated fee dynamics in 2022 while underlying growth across Security Services and Market and Wealth Services was offset by headwinds in Investment and Wealth Management. For 2023, we expect to return to some underlying fee growth for the firm. Now Robin talked about the work we've been doing over the last few months to bend the cost curve while making sure we're continuing to invest for 2023. This translates into expenses, excluding notable items increasing by approximately 4%, assuming exchange rates remain flat to where they ended 2022 or by approximately 4.5% on a constant currency basis.This compares to 8% in 2022. And then on taxes, we expect our effective tax rate for the year to be in the 21% to 22% range, primarily due to an increase of the corporation tax rate in the UK this year. And finally, I want to close with a few remarks on capital management. As you saw, we ended 2022 comfortably above our management target. And our Board of Directors has authorized a new $5 billion share repurchase program, which provides us ample flexibility. As always, the timing and the amount of repurchases is subject to various factors, including our capital position and prevailing market conditions, among others. Based on our current expectation for continued earnings growth in combination with our estimated trajectory of AOCI to par, we're now resuming buybacks and we'd expect to return north of 100% of earnings through dividends and buybacks in 2023.With that, operator, can you please open the line for questions.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

According to the World Economic Forum's 2023 Global Risks Report, biodiversity loss is the fourth most severe global risk over the next ten years behind climate action failure, climate change adaptation, and extreme weather. Therefore, market participants need a credible, quantitative approach to measure the biodiversity impact and dependencies of their operations and portfolios, mitigate risks, and advance nature-positive outcomes to build resilience.The new methodology outlines metrics and data that enable companies and investors to identify and quantify nature-related exposure. The methodology covers several key areas, including risks arising from companies' impacts on biodiversity, risks arising from companies' dependencies on biodiversity and potential risks via proximity to biodiverse areas.The launch of the Nature Risk Profile methodology follows on the heels of the adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, in December 2022. The Global Biodiversity Framework includes a target for governments to take legal, administrative or policy measures to encourage and enable businesses to regularly monitor, assess, and transparently disclose their risks, dependencies and impacts on biodiversity. Governments furthermore agreed that these requirements apply to all large as well as transnational companies and financial institutions along with their operations, supply and value chains, and portfolios.Story continuesThe potential impact of the Nature Risk Profile methodology is significant, transforming the parameters of financial decision-making. Developed by experts from across the conservation, business, and finance communities, it aligns with the emerging approach of the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) and will support the implementation of TNFD's disclosure framework.The methodology allows users to combine company-level information with best-practice nature-related data to calculate vital risk metrics. It is built around using powerful, science-based impact and dependency measurement tools, including the Exploring Natural Capital Opportunities, Risks and Exposure database and the developing Ecosystem Integrity Index.S&amp;P Global Sustainable1 has also launched a new knowledge community inviting investment managers, insurers, businesses, non-profits, and others to collaborate on ways to further develop the methodology to accelerate the shift of capital towards nature-positive outcomes. This pilot programme will support the practical implementation of the TNFD framework process using geospatial biodiversity datasets curated by the UN Environment Programme World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) and partners, combined with S&amp;P Global's in-depth information about local business activities.Neville Ash, Director of UNEP-WCMC, said: ""The methodology provides a major step forward to deliver the actions required for transformative change and support the finance sector's critical contribution to delivering the ambitions of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. This methodology links science, policy and finance to bring nature to the heart of financial decision-making. The collaboration with a global financial data provider such as S&amp;P helps to test the methodology using their location-specific data on thousands of financial and corporate assets. In developing and sharing this methodology as a public good, we are supporting the TNFD in implementing a common and harmonized approach to nature-related risk management within the finance sector.""Dr Richard Mattison, President of S&amp;P Global Sustainable1, said: ""Against the backdrop of net zero commitments from investors and companies, it is essential that net zero for climate should be net positive for nature in line with the important work of the TNFD. The development of this new methodology will be key to unlocking better understanding, analysis and action around nature-related risks for companies and investors. Significantly, the methodology will also be open access, and developed and refined by stakeholders, to support transparency and adoption.""For additional information and to view the full methodology, please visit S&amp;P Global Sustainable1's nature website.Notes to EditorsAbout the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)The UN Environment Programme is the leading global voice on the environment.

122,c11b320b-5695-39e7-80ae-2d74eba6d7dc,SYF,2023-01-17,Earnings Preview: Synchrony (SYF) Q4 Earnings Expected to Decline,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/earnings-preview-synchrony-syf-q4-150003298.html,1673881203,STORY,['SYF-PA'],"[The market expects Synchrony (SYF) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 23, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis consumer credit company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.10 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -25.7%.Revenues are expected to be $4.03 billion, up 5.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.12% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Synchrony?For Synchrony, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -8.82%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Synchrony will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Synchrony would post earnings of $1.42 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.47, delivering a surprise of +3.52%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Synchrony doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

These include petroleum products (26.9%), engineering goods (11.9%), gems and jewellery (15.2%), and drugs and pharmaceuticals (1.9%). On the other hand, imports of key items like gold, silver, electronic goods, and project goods also contracted.India’s exports to the US were highest at $59.6 billion in April-December 2022. Others that followed are the UAE, Netherlands, Bangladesh, and Singapore.India should aim to reduce its import billWith the likelihood of a global recession rising in 2023, Indian traders are likely to face more challenges. A part of the problem is that India imports more than it exports, inflating the country’s trade balance.Analysts believe its reliance on crude oil for 80% of its energy requirements must be reduced. “India must re-energize exploration of local oil fields and enhance production through coal mines. Any development will cut the energy import bill substantially and improve the current account,” The Economic Times reported in January, citing the economic think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).Story continuesIndia is estimated to pay $270 billion for coal and crude imports in 2022, accounting for about 40% of its total merchandise bill, GTRI said.India’s commerce ministry is doing a “country-wise as well as commodity-wise” analysis to boost exports, the Financial Times reported today, quoting commerce secretary Sunil Bharthwal.

Expedia’s web portals focus on travel planning, travel purchases, and travel experience sharing.TripAdvisor’s platform is also for users to share reviews and opinions on hotels, destinations, attractions, and restaurants. In addition to this, TripAdvisor also facilitates bookings between hotel operators and consumers.TripAdvisor’s top-line growth is starting to stick out. TripAdvisor’s current fiscal 2022 sales are now expected to pop 64% and climb another 17% in FY23 to $1.73 billion. More importantly, fiscal 2023 would represent 10% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $1.56 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLooking at Expedia, sales are forecasted to jump 37% for its current fiscal 2022 and rise another 9% in FY23 at $12.87 billion. With 2019 sales at $12 billion, fiscal 2023 would be a 7% increase from pre-pandemic levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings EstimatesOn the bottom line, Expedia’s earnings are very intriguing and expected to now rebound 352% for FY22 at $7.46 a share compared to EPS of $1.65 per share in 2021. Even better, fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to climb another 20%. Plus, earnings estimate revisions have noticeably increased  for FY22 and FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPivoting to TripAdvisor, earnings are now expected to be $0.61 a share for FY22 compared to an adjusted loss of -$0.30 per share in 2021. Fiscal 2023 earnings are forecasted to rebound another 120% at $1.34 per share. Earnings estimates have gone down for FY22 and have slightly declined for FY23 as well.Story continuesPerformance &amp; Recent Momentum Over the last year, TripAdvisor is down -26% Vs. Expedia’s -42% with both underperforming the S&amp;P 500’s -16%. Looking at the last decade, Expedia’s +70% has largely outperformed TripAdvisor’s -51% but still trailed the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlthough Expedia and TripAdvisor’s historical performances have lagged the broader market, analysts have remained very optimistic about online travel companies due to pent-up demand and a resilient consumer.This has recently led to continued rallies in Expedia and TripAdvisor stock with both up roughly +24% in the last month to impressively top the rally in broader indexes to start the new year.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation After the recent spike in Expedia and TripAdvisor stock, they still trade reasonably relative to their past which could support more upside ahead. Shares of Expedia especially stand out trading at $106 per share and 15.3X forward earnings. In comparison, TripAdvisor trades around $21 per share and 32.6X forward earnings.Expedia trades nicely below the industry average of 24.4X and beneath the S&amp;P 500’s 17.9X. This is also 76% below its decade high of 63.5X and a 40% discount to the median of 25.5X. In its own right, TripAdvisor stock trades much more reasonably to its extreme decade-long high of 3,600X and at a 33% discount to the median of 48.9X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineExpedia stock appears to have the edge over its online travel peer and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in correlation with rising earnings estimate revisions, along with its standout valuation among the industry.However, TripAdvisor’s top-line growth is very impressive and the company appears to be a sound investment as well with earnings stabilizing despite estimates trending down over the last quarter.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.Life and the stock market are both about expectations, and rising above what is expected is often rewarded, while falling short can come with negative consequences. Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Expedia (EXPE) earns a Zacks Rank #1 24 days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 9, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $2.01 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $2.01 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.88 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Expedia has an Earnings ESP of 7.03%.EXPE is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at GameStop (GME) as well.Slated to report earnings on March 16, 2023, GameStop holds a #2 (Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is -$0.13 a share 59 days from its next quarterly update.For GameStop, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of -$0.16 is 16.13%.Story continuesEXPE and GME's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The mission will take place in 2023 aboard Lockheed Martin's (NYSE: LMT) LM 400 Technology Demonstrator spacecraft.(PRNewsfoto/Filecoin Foundation)Previously, in May 2022 in Davos, FF announced an initial effort with Lockheed Martin to deploy IPFS in space to improve the speed of data transfer across long distances. This mission is the next step in that project, bringing the benefits of decentralized storage to space and exploring use cases for how IPFS can enable better interplanetary communication and data transfer.""From the beginning, IPFS was envisioned as a technology that can enable networking across 'interplanetary' distances,"" said Marta Belcher, president and chair of Filecoin Foundation. ""Today's centralized internet model doesn't work in space. Let's say you're on the moon and you're retrieving data from Earth; each time you retrieve that data, there will be a multi-second delay. With IPFS, data doesn't need to go back and forth from Earth with every click. That's because, with IPFS, data is identified by what it is rather than where it is. Each piece of content has a unique 'content ID.' When you look for a piece of content, that content is retrieved from wherever is closest, rather than always being retrieved from a particular server. That means if someone nearby on the moon has already retrieved that data, it only has to travel a short distance and can get to you quickly instead of traveling back and forth from Earth with every click.""This mission is the first of its kind to evaluate in-space use cases for decentralized storage. It will be hosted aboard Lockheed Martin's self-funded LM 400 Technology Demonstrator – a software-defined satellite about the size of a refrigerator, designed to support a wide range of missions and customers. Once the spacecraft is in orbit, it will use its SmartSat™ software-defined satellite technology to upload and perform the IPFS demonstration.Story continues""The LM 400 Tech Demonstrator mission will showcase how IPFS can make larger quantities of data from space available to multiple ground-based applications in simpler ways,"" remarked Joe Landon, vice president and general manager of lunar infrastructure services at Lockheed Martin. ""It will serve as the foundational infrastructure to enable more efficient interplanetary communication for our collective, long-term presence in Earth orbit, at the moon, and beyond.""The mission will demonstrate a space-to-ground communication use case for IPFS. Data from space will be ""content-addressed"" using IPFS and made available on the IPFS network through a ground station. Applications using IPFS will be able to retrieve the data from the IPFS network, without needing to know the location of the specific ground station holding the data.IPFS is a decentralized protocol for storing and sharing data that uses content-addressing to uniquely identify files. IPFS is a foundational technology for the Filecoin network, a cryptocurrency-powered decentralized storage network. The IPFS software layer for space is designed to be usable for a wide range of use cases and architectures and topologies, including space-to-space communication. The software is open-source licensed and is being developed in public.About Filecoin Foundation Filecoin Foundation (FF) facilitates governance of the Filecoin network, funds research and development projects for decentralized web technologies, and supports the growth of the Filecoin ecosystem and community.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH), The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and Roche Holding AG (RHHBY). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of UnitedHealth Group have gained +4.5% over the past year against the Zacks Medical sector's -12% decline and -15.7% decline for the S&amp;P 500 index. The company’s top line has been growing and the momentum should continue in the years ahead on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings.The company's solid health services segment provides diversification benefits. UNH's Government business remains well-poised for growth. A sturdy balance sheet enables investments.However, softness in commercial business due to COVID-induced volatilities persists. Rising operating costs are hurting margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth Group here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Coca-Cola held up a lot better than many others in last year's tough market; the stock was effectively flat in 2022, modestly better than rival Pepsi's -0.3% decline, but significantly better than the Zacks Consumer Staple sector's -5.1% decline (the market overall was down -15.7%). The company is scheduled to report 2022 Q4 results on February 14th, but its preceding period results (2022 Q3) benefited from the continued momentum from the first half of 2022. Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales.Coca-Cola benefited from underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels. According to the Zacks analyst estimate organic revenue growth of 14.8% and comparable earnings per share growth of 6.6%, in line with the company’s raised view for 2022. Innovations and accelerating digital investments bode well.However, pressures from higher transportation and input costs remain. Higher marketing spends and currency headwinds are concerning.(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Roche Holding have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-21.6% vs. +14.6%). The company’s performance has been hit by significantly lower COVID-related sales in both divisions as the pandemic eased out. Sales of Actemra/RoActemra and Ronapreve (COVID-19) are declining with the pandemic weakening in several countries since last year. The competition is stiff for Tecentriq. The decline in sales of drugs like Herceptin, Avastin and MabThera will continue to drag sales down. Pipeline setbacks are a concern.Nevertheless, strong demand for new drugs, namely Hemlibra (hemophilia), Ocrevus (multiple sclerosis), Evrysdi (spinal muscular atrophy), Phesgo (cancer) and Tecentriq (cancer), maintained momentum. The Diagnostics division also remained stable in terms of the growth of its routine business.(You can read the full research report on Roche Holding here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Lam Research Corporation (LRCX) and Valero Energy Corporation (VLO).Director of ResearchSheraz MianNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

Yet, the U.S. government's tiff with Turkey over its involvement in Russia's S-400 may hurt F-35 program.Lam Research (LRCX) Benefits From Strengthening NAND DemandPer the Zacks analyst, increasing NAND requirement in accelerating 5G migration, video, and new game consoles is driving the top-line growth of Lam Research.Valero Energy (VLO) Banks on its Renewable Diesel BusinessThe Zacks analyst likes Valero Energy since it continues to bank on its lucrative lower-carbon renewable diesel business. However, rising costs and expenses hurt the firm's bottom line.Digitization &amp; Expansion Initiatives to Aid AutoZone (AZO)While the ramp up of e-commerce efforts and the rollout of hubs and mega-hubs are fueling AutoZone's top-line growth, the Zacks analyst is worried about the firm's rising debt pile.Welltower (WELL) to Grow on Portfolio-Restructuring EffortsPer the Zacks analystp, Welltower's portfolio-restructuring moves bode well for long-term sustainability and cash-flow growth. However, rising interest rates remain a key concern for the company.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Gains on Robust Omnichannel OperationsPer the Zacks analyst, Ulta Beauty has been gaining on its robust omnichannel initiatives. Its buy online pickup in-store has been a key driver, contributing 23% to third-quarter e-commerce sales.Product Launches Aid Masimo (MASI) Amid Stiff CompetitionThe Zacks analyst is upbeat about Masimo's product launches over the past few months despite its operation in a highly competitive market.New UpgradesRecurring Revenues &amp; Technology Growth Aid Envestnet (ENV)Per the Zacks analyst, Envestnet's business model ensures solid asset-based and subscription-based recurring revenue generation capacity. Also, focus on technology development is a tailwind.Growing Electronic Warfare Systems Demand Aid Mercury (MRCY)Per the Zacks Analyst, high demand for electronic warfare, increased upgrades on electronic subsystems and continued flow of deals are aiding Mercury Systems' growth.Strong Performance of IoT Business Aids Blackberry (BB)Per the Zacks analyst, Blackberry is expected to benefit from continued demand for its IoT businesses supported by a robust pipeline of design wins.

Work related to this deal will be executed in Patuxent River, MD.Growing Jet Demand &amp; V-22 JetsA rapid increase in terror attacks has compelled nations to strengthen their arsenal and bump up their defense budget. With the United States being the largest exporter of defense equipment across the world, there is a steady flow of contracts for its combat-proven weaponry from both Pentagon and its foreign allies. With military jets and helicopters constituting a major portion of a nation's armaments, there is a steady flow of contracts for these.Bell-Boeing's primary product, V-22 Osprey is a family of multi-mission, tiltrotor military aircraft with both vertical as well as short takeoff and landing capabilities.

The new radar system, AN/APG-85, will replace the earlier AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array radar system.With this declaration, the company aims to incorporate advanced technologies and signal processing techniques that will be well-suited for all the variants of the F-35 Lightning II.What’s Favoring Northrop Grumman?Northrop Grumman plays a critical role in the production of the F-35 Lightning II family of jets. Thus, the company stands to benefit from the strong demand the jet enjoys in the military landscape.In this context, it is imperative to mention that apart from eight international program partners, F-35 is being procured by eight other foreign military sales (FMS) customers of the United States. Such an intense demand for the jet is certain to benefit NOC, which provides many other key technologies for the jet apart from radars.The U.S. Government boasts a current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy, commitments from seven international partner countries and eight FMS customers and interests from other countries.The highly sought-after demand for the military jet may witness a handful of orders for the F-35 Lightning II. This may act as a catalyst for the growth of Northrop Grumman, whose technologically advanced products act as a cornerstone for many military jets.Moreover, NOC’s continuous effort to take a step forward in developing more advanced technologies to meet the ever-changing dynamics of the military world provides a competitive edge to the company. In this regard, the company invested $2.5 billion in capex, and research and development in 2022.Going forward, with an anticipated rise in key military programs, Northrop Grumman may witness a steady inflow of orders involving military equipment and arsenals, including radars.Story continuesGrowth ProspectsThe rising geopolitical tensions and the threat of terrorism globally have resulted in countries fortifying their defense spending to reinforce their national defense systems. In such a scenario, the demand for technologically advanced radars, which can assure the advanced surveillance of the rising threat on the land, sea and air, may increase.Per a report published by the Fortune Business Insights firm, the military radar market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 6.3% during the 2021-2028 period. This should benefit NOC and prominent defense majors like Lockheed Martin LMT, L3Harris Technologies LHX and Raytheon Technologies RTX as they play a significant role in manufacturing radars.Lockheed Martin’s radars are designed with the highest degree of commonality and fully integrated systems. These can operate in all environments and are available in highly mobile configurations and deployed worldwide. Its portfolio of radars includes the AN/APY-9 radar, the IRST21 Sensos system, AN/TPQ-53 radar systems, SPY-7, the long-range discrimination radar and a few more.Lockheed Martin’s long-term earnings growth rate stands at 6.2%. LMT shares have returned 20.7% in the past year.L3Harris manufactures a handful of combat-proven radars like the SPS-48, land-based surveillance radars, the AN/APY-11 Multimode radar, the Tactical Air Surveillance radar, the AN/SPS-48G Long-range 3D surveillance radar and many more.The long-term growth rate of L3 Harris is pegged at 2.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LHX’s 2023 earnings suggests a growth rate of 3.9% from the prior-year estimated figure.Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space has been at the forefront of tactical fighter radar technology. Some of its products include APG-79, APG-82, Phantom Strike, B-52 AESA Radar, etc.The long-term growth rate of Raytheon is pegged at 9.5%. RTX shares have rallied 6.9% in the past year.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Northrop Grumman have risen 14.3% against the industry’s decline of 10.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Further, these companies have remained ahead of the curve when it comes to changes and innovation. The result is sustained value creation through dividends and capital gains.It’s also worth mentioning that most of these stocks to buy and hold is low-beta stocks. Amidst market volatility, these stocks offer protection from capital erosion. I would personally allocate at least 40% to 50% of my portfolio toward these stocks. I can also say with some conviction that total returns (dividend and capital gains) from these stocks over the next five to ten years will outperform the index.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsLet’s discuss the reasons to be bullish on these stocks to buy and hold forever.TickerCompanyPriceCVXChevron Corporation$177.56LMTLockheed Martin$449.83COSTCostco Wholesale$485.25RIORio Tinto$77.55AAPLApple$134.76NEMNewmont Corporation$54.35FFord Motor$12.72Chevron Corporation (CVX)Chevron has Put a Priority on Protecting Its Big, Fat DividendSource: Denis Kuvaev / Shutterstock.comChevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stock is among the top stocks to buy and hold. The oil and gas exploration company was in an uptrend last year, and I expect the positive momentum to sustain. Besides the potential for capital gains, CVX stock also offers an attractive dividend yield of 3.24%.From a fundamental perspective, there are two important reasons to like Chevron. First, the company has an investment-grade balance sheet with a net-debt ratio of 4.9% as of Q3 2022. Further, the company has low break-even assets that enable the generation of robust cash flows.For Q3 2022, Chevron reported an operating cash flow of $13.7 billion. With an annual OCF visibility in excess of $40 billion, Chevron is positioned to make big investments and potentially increase dividends. It’s also worth noting that Chevron has a strong resource base, which implies steady production in the coming years.Story continuesLockheed Martin (LMT)A Lockheed Martin (LMT) Space Systems sign in Sunnyvale, California.Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comGlobal defense spending exceeded $2 trillion in 2021. It’s likely that defense spending will continue to increase with several points of geopolitical friction. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock looks attractive and is worth holding in the core portfolio.In the last 12 months, LMT stock has trended higher by 27%, and the stock also offers a dividend yield of 2.59%. As the company’s order backlog swells, it’s likely that investment returns will remain robust. As of Q3 2022, Lockheed reported an order backlog of $140 billion.For the last quarter, Lockheed reported a free cash flow of $2.7 billion. This implies an annualized FCF potential in excess of $10 billion. Therefore, dividend growth is likely to sustain.Lockheed Martin has also been investing in new technology. This is a catalyst for growth over the next decade. The investments include a focus on hypersonics, directed energy, and autonomy, among others. With a strong balance sheet, Lockheed is also positioned for potential acquisitions in the defense space.Costco Wholesale (COST)A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.Source: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.comCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) has been sideways to lower in the last 12 months. This was expected, considering inflationary pressure. Further, the stock has discounted the potential impact of aggressive rate hikes on consumer spending.Besides these near-term headwinds, COST stock is worth holding for the coming years. The U.S. economy is primarily consumption-based, and retail spending is a critical component.Another point to note is that sales growth has been healthy even amidst challenges. For the 18 weeks that ended on Jan. 1, Costco reported sales growth of 7.6% on a year-on-year basis to $82.16 billion. The outlook remains positive, with comparable store sales growth being healthy in the U.S.Costco also has 66.9 million households as members. This has translated into $4.3 billion in membership fees in the last 12 months. With continued expansion in the U.S. and internationally, recurring income is likely to swell. This will have a sustained positive impact on cash flows.Rio Tinto (RIO)the rio tinto (RIO) logo on a building during daylightSource: Rob Bayer / Shutterstock.comRio Tinto (NYSE:RIO) looks attractive among commodity stocks to buy and hold forever. The stock has been in an uptrend, with a rally of 35% in the last six months. At a forward price-earnings ratio of 8.8 times, the stock remains a compelling buy. A dividend yield of 9.0% adds to the attractiveness.One reason to like Rio is an investment-grade balance sheet. Further, for the first half of 2022, Rio reported a free cash flow of $7.1 billion. Robust financial flexibility will ensure that dividends sustain. At the same time, Rio is positioned to make big investments to potentially accelerate growth.In December 2022, Rio completed the acquisition of Turquoise Hill Resources for a consideration of $3.1 billion. This boosts the company’s copper portfolio. Rio is also positioned to be the largest source of lithium supply in Europe for the next 15 years. With a global push towards green energy, these base metals will drive growth for Rio Tinto.Apple (AAPL)Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shopSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.comApple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been an underperformer in the last 12 months. During this period, the stock declined by 25%. However, the business is a cash flow machine, and Apple is an innovator. The correction provides a good entry opportunity for the long term.From the sales perspective, the iPhone segment remains the key growth driver. At the same time, the services and wearable segment growth has been encouraging. With product diversification, the growth outlook is positive.Further, Apple has nearly $170 billion in cash and equivalents. With strong operating cash flows, dividend growth will continue along with share repurchases. Also, Apple is positioned to pursue inorganic growth by investing in innovation-driven start-ups.There are reports that Apple has delayed its self-driving car launch until 2026. The company plans to sell consumer models for under $100,000. With a loyal customer base, the launch of the Apple car might be a big growth catalyst.Newmont Corporation (NEM)Newmont logo on a mobile phone screenSource: Piotr Swat/ShutterstockGold has already been trending higher, and there are several long-term catalysts for the precious metal. This includes geopolitical tension, inflation, and a weak dollar. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) stock is a good proxy for investing in gold. The gold miner has remained subdued in the last 12 months, with gold remaining sideways to lower. NEM stock is, however, attractive at current levels and offers a dividend yield of 4.12%.Newmont Corporation has an investment-grade balance sheet, and that’s a key reason to like the stock. With strong financial flexibility, the company is positioned to sustain dividends and accelerate investments.Newmont has a strong asset base with 96 million ounces of proven reserves. With investment in exploration activity, reserve replacement has remained strong. The company expects to deliver steady production through 2040.Therefore, even if gold trades around $2,000 an ounce, Newmont will report robust free cash flows. The company expects to lower the all-in-sustaining cost in the coming years. If gold trends are higher, meaningful EBITDA margin expansion can be expected.Ford Motor (F)Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.Source: D K Grove / Shutterstock.comAmong the traditional automakers, Ford (NYSE:F) looks attractive among stocks to buy and hold. Ford has aggressive plans for the transformation of its portfolio towards EVs, and that’s likely to create value.F stock trades at an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 6.8 times and offers a dividend yield of 3.7%. The downside is capped from current levels, while the upside potential is meaningful.Talking about EV plans, Ford expects to deliver a global capacity of 600,000 EVs by the end of 2023. Further, the company expects 40% to 50% of its global vehicle sales to be EVs by 2030. The company has also been investing in building battery plants to ensure that the supply chain remains smooth.An important point to note is that Ford reported a total liquidity buffer of $49.2 billion as of Q3 2022. With positive free cash flows, the company has ample financial flexibility to make big investments for portfolio transformation.On the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

147,f7ab3363-350f-3c3c-b9ce-b6d469f2d264,NOC,2023-01-17,Northrop (NOC) Builds Advanced Radar for the F-35 Lightning II,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/northrop-noc-builds-advanced-radar-115211790.html,1673869931,STORY,"['NOC', 'LHX', 'RTX', 'LMT']","[Northrop Grumman Corporation NOC recently revealed that it is building an advanced radar system for the stealth F-35 Lightning II fighter jet. The new radar system, AN/APG-85, will replace the earlier AN/APG-81 active electronically scanned array radar system.With this declaration, the company aims to incorporate advanced technologies and signal processing techniques that will be well-suited for all the variants of the F-35 Lightning II.What’s Favoring Northrop Grumman?Northrop Grumman plays a critical role in the production of the F-35 Lightning II family of jets. Thus, the company stands to benefit from the strong demand the jet enjoys in the military landscape.In this context, it is imperative to mention that apart from eight international program partners, F-35 is being procured by eight other foreign military sales (FMS) customers of the United States. Such an intense demand for the jet is certain to benefit NOC, which provides many other key technologies for the jet apart from radars.The U.S. Government boasts a current inventory objective of 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. Marine Corps and the U.S. Navy, commitments from seven international partner countries and eight FMS customers and interests from other countries.The highly sought-after demand for the military jet may witness a handful of orders for the F-35 Lightning II. This may act as a catalyst for the growth of Northrop Grumman, whose technologically advanced products act as a cornerstone for many military jets.Moreover, NOC’s continuous effort to take a step forward in developing more advanced technologies to meet the ever-changing dynamics of the military world provides a competitive edge to the company. In this regard, the company invested $2.5 billion in capex, and research and development in 2022.Going forward, with an anticipated rise in key military programs, Northrop Grumman may witness a steady inflow of orders involving military equipment and arsenals, including radars.Story continuesGrowth ProspectsThe rising geopolitical tensions and the threat of terrorism globally have resulted in countries fortifying their defense spending to reinforce their national defense systems. In such a scenario, the demand for technologically advanced radars, which can assure the advanced surveillance of the rising threat on the land, sea and air, may increase.Per a report published by the Fortune Business Insights firm, the military radar market is projected to expand at a CAGR of 6.3% during the 2021-2028 period. This should benefit NOC and prominent defense majors like Lockheed Martin LMT, L3Harris Technologies LHX and Raytheon Technologies RTX as they play a significant role in manufacturing radars.Lockheed Martin’s radars are designed with the highest degree of commonality and fully integrated systems. These can operate in all environments and are available in highly mobile configurations and deployed worldwide. Its portfolio of radars includes the AN/APY-9 radar, the IRST21 Sensos system, AN/TPQ-53 radar systems, SPY-7, the long-range discrimination radar and a few more.Lockheed Martin’s long-term earnings growth rate stands at 6.2%. LMT shares have returned 20.7% in the past year.L3Harris manufactures a handful of combat-proven radars like the SPS-48, land-based surveillance radars, the AN/APY-11 Multimode radar, the Tactical Air Surveillance radar, the AN/SPS-48G Long-range 3D surveillance radar and many more.The long-term growth rate of L3 Harris is pegged at 2.7%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LHX’s 2023 earnings suggests a growth rate of 3.9% from the prior-year estimated figure.Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space has been at the forefront of tactical fighter radar technology. Some of its products include APG-79, APG-82, Phantom Strike, B-52 AESA Radar, etc.The long-term growth rate of Raytheon is pegged at 9.5%. RTX shares have rallied 6.9% in the past year.Price MovementIn the past year, shares of Northrop Grumman have risen 14.3% against the industry’s decline of 10.2%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks RankNorthrop Grumman currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Please note today's call is being recorded. I would now like to turn the call over to John Campbell, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin the conference.Photo by rupixen.com on UnsplashJohn Campbell: Thank you. Good morning. Thank you for joining our call today where our CEO, Charlie Scharf; and our CFO, Mike Santomassimo, will discuss fourth quarter results and answer your questions. This call is being recorded. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that our fourth quarter earnings materials, including the release, financial supplement and presentation deck are available on our website at wellsfargo.com. I'd also like to come that we may make forward-looking statements during today's call that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Factors that may cause the actual results to differ materially from expectations are detailed in our SEC filings including the Form 8-K filed today containing our earnings materials.Information about any non-GAAP final measures referenced, including a reconciliation of those measures to GAAP measures, can also be found in our SEC filings and the earnings materials available on our website. I will now turn the call over to Charlie.Charles Scharf: Thanks, John. I'll make some brief comments about our fourth-quarter results, and then update you on our priorities. I'll then turn the call over to Mike to review fourth-quarter results in more detail and some of our expectations for 2023 before we take your questions. Let me start with fourth-quarter highlights. Our results were significantly impacted by previously disclosed operating losses, but our underlying performance reflected the continued progress we're making to improve returns. Rising interest rates drove strong net interest income growth. Our continued progress and our efficiency initiatives helped to drive expenses lower excluding operating losses. Loans grew in both our commercial and consumer portfolios, and charge-offs have continued to increase but credit quality remains strong.Story continuesOur capital levels also remained very strong. And our CET1 ratio increased to 10.6%, well above our required minimum plus buffers. We also continue to make progress on putting legacy issues behind us. Our broad reaching agreement with the CFPB in December is an important step forward that helps us resolve multiple matters, the majority of which have been outstanding for several years. Over the past three years, we have made significant changes in the businesses referenced in the settlement, and many of the required actions were already substantially complete prior to this announcement. While our risk and regulatory work hasn't always followed a straight line and we have more to do, we've made significant progress, and we will continue to prioritize our work here.In addition to our risk and regulatory work, it's also critical for us to continue to invest in the future as we build off the great market positions we have. We are confident our processes will enable us to continue to prioritize our risk and control work. At the same time, we invest in our future. And as I look back at '22, I'm enthusiastic about the progress we've made this past year and feel even better about the opportunities ahead. Let me start with the changes we've made during the year to help millions of customers avoid overdraft fees and meet short-term cash needs. These efforts included the elimination of non-sufficient funds fees and transfer fees for customers enrolled in overdraft protection, early payday making eligible direct deposits available up to two days early, extra-day grace, giving eligible customers an extra business day to make deposits to avoid overdraft fees.And in the fourth quarter, we launched Flex Loan, a new digital-only small dollar loan that provides eligible customers convenient and affordable access to funds. Teams from across the company came together to roll out this new product in record time. The rollout has been smooth and though it's still early, customer response is exceeding our expectations. These actions build on services we've introduced over the past several years, including Clear Access Banking, our account with no overdraft fees. We now have over 1.7 million of those accounts, up 48% from a year ago. We continue to transform the way we serve our customers by offering innovative products and solutions. We continue to improve our credit card offerings including launching two new cards, Wells Fargo Autograph and BILT.Our new products helped drive a 31% increase in new credit card accounts in 2022, while we continued to maintain strong credit profiles. We launched Wells Fargo Premier, our new offering dedicated to the financial needs of affluent clients by bringing together our branch-based and wealth-based businesses, to provide a more comprehensive, relevant and integrated offering for our clients. We continue to enhance our partnership within our Commercial business to bring Corporate and Investment Banking products such as foreign exchange and M&amp;A advisory services to our middle-market clients. Our different approach to technology is helping us better serve our consumer and corporate clients. We rolled out our new mobile app with a simpler, more intuitive user experience, which has improved customer satisfaction.In 2022, mobile active customers grew 4% from a year ago. We launched Intuitive Investor, making it easier for customers to invest with the streamlined account opening process and a lower minimum investment. And total active Intuitive Investor accounts increased 56% from a year ago. We completed the development of Fargo, our new AI-powered virtual assistant that provides a more personalized, convenient, and simple banking experience, which is currently live for eligible employees and set to begin rolling out to customers early this year. Last month, we announced Vantage, our new enhanced digital experience for our commercial and corporate clients. Vantage uses AI and machine learning to provide a tailored and intuitive platform based on our clients' specific needs.Over the past year, our industry-leading API platform team continued the development of payment APIs for commercial and corporate clients invested in solutions to support our financial institution clients, ramps up in group product offerings in consumer lending and began developing commercial lending solutions. We are investing heavily in modernizing the IT infrastructure and the way we develop code. We're implementing a cloud-native operating model that allows us to innovate faster. We've also been investing in modernization in the areas of payments and corporate lending, taking out legacy applications and digitizing processes end to end. These enhanced digital capabilities are just the start of initiatives we have planned as part of our multiyear digital transformation.We also continue to evaluate our existing businesses. As we announced earlier this week, we plan to create a more focused Home Lending business aimed at serving primarily bank customers as well as individuals and families and minority communities. This includes exiting the correspondent business and reducing the size of our servicing portfolio. I'm saying for some time that the mortgage business has changed dramatically since the financial crisis, and we've been adjusting our strategy accordingly. We're focused on our customers, profitability, returns, and serving minority communities, not volume or market share. The mortgage product is important to our customer base and the communities we serve, so it will remain important to us, but we do not need to be one of the biggest originators or services -- servicers in the industry to do this effectively.Across all of our businesses, we must evolve as the market regulation and competition has evolved. And while it may seem counterintuitive, we believe the decision to reduce risk in the mortgage business by reducing size and narrowing our focus will actually -- this will actually enable us to serve customers better and will also improve our returns in the long term. Changing gears now, I'm proud of all we did last year to make progress on our environmental, social, and governance work. We are balanced in our approach to these issues and believe that thinking broadly about our stakeholders will enhance returns to shareholders. And we provide many examples on Slide 2 of our presentation. So, let me just highlight two examples here. We published our first diversity, equity, and inclusion report, which highlights the progress that we've made on our DE&amp;I initiatives.We'll continue to make progress in our commitment to integrating DE&amp;I into every aspect of the company under the new leadership of Kristy Fercho, who joined Wells Fargo in 2023 to lead our Home Lending business and was named the company's new head of diverse segments, representation, and inclusion in the fourth quarter. We've commissioned an external third-party racial equity audit, and we plan to publish the results of the assessment by the end of this year. 2022 is a turning point in the economic cycle. The Federal Reserve has made clear that reducing inflation is its priority, and it will continue to take actions necessary to achieve its goal. We are starting to see the impact on consumer spend, credit, housing, and demands for goods and services.But at this point, the impact of consumers and businesses has been manageable. And though there will certainly be some industries and segments of consumers that are more impacted than others, the rate impact we see in our customer base is not materially -- I'm sorry, the rate of impact we see in our customer base is not materially accelerating. This plus the strength with which consumers and businesses went into this slowing economy is a helpful set of facts as we look forward. Our customers have remained resilient with deposit balances, consumer spending and credit quality still stronger than pre-pandemic levels. As we look forward, we're carefully watching the impact of higher rates on our customers and expect to see deposit balances and credit quality continue to return toward pre-pandemic levels.While we're not predicting a severe downturn, we must be prepared for one, and we are stronger company than one and two years ago. Our margins are wider, our returns are higher, we're better managed, and our capital position is strong, so we feel prepared for a downside scenario if we see broader deterioration than we currently see or predict. We still have clear opportunities to improve our performance as we make progress on our efficiency initiatives and continue to make the investments necessary to grow the business through technology and product enhancements. Two years ago, we shared a path to higher ROTCE by returning capital to our shareholders and executing on our efficiency initiatives. While high levels of operating losses in the second half of '22 impacted our results, our underlying business performance demonstrated our ability to improve our returns.In a moment, Mike will highlight the key drivers of our path to a 15% ROTCE, which we believe is achievable based on the strength of our business model and our ability to execute. While we're focused on improving our returns, making progress on building the appropriate risk and control and infrastructure for a company of our size and complexity will remain our top priority, and we will dedicate the time and resources necessary. I want to conclude by thanking our employees across the company who are working hard each day to continue to make progress in our transformation. I'm excited about all that we will accomplish in the year ahead. I'll now turn the call over to Mike.See also 11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy and 15 Largest Orthopedic Companies in the World.Mike Santomassimo: Thank you, Charlie. And good morning, everyone. Slides 2 and 3 summarize how we helped our customers, communities and employees last year, some of which Charlie covered. So, I'm going to start with our fourth-quarter financial results on Slide 4. Net income for the fourth quarter was 2.9 billion, or $0.67, per diluted common share. Our fourth-quarter results included 3.3 billion, or $0.70, per share of operating losses primarily related to a variety of previously disclosed historical matters, including litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation. $1 billion of impairment of equity securities, or 749 million after noncontrolling interest, predominantly in our affiliated venture capital business, primarily driven by portfolio companies in the enterprise software sector.Both, slowing revenue growth rates and lower public market valuations of enterprise software companies impact the valuations. It's important to note that even after recognizing this impairment, the current value of these investments at the end of 2022 remained above the amount of the initial investment. $353 million of severance expense, primarily in Home Lending. While we've reduced headcount in this business throughout 2022, this charge includes the actions we plan to take in 2023 related to the mortgage announcement we made earlier this week. These reductions were partially offset by 510 million of discrete tax benefits related to interest and overpayments in prior years. We highlight capital on Slide 5. Our CET1 ratio was 10.6%, up approximately 30 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the benefit from our fourth-quarter earnings, the annual share issuance for our 401(k) plan matching contribution, and an increase from AOCI.Our CET1 ratio remained well above our required regulatory minimum plus buffers, which increased by 10 basis points to 9.2% at the start of the fourth quarter as our new stress capital buffer took effect. As a reminder, our G-SIB surcharge will not increase in 2023. While we have not repurchased any common stock since the first quarter of 2022, we currently expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter of this year. Turning to credit quality on Slide 7. Credit performance remained strong with 23 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. However, as expected, losses are slowly increasing from historical lows, and we expect them to continue to return toward pre-pandemic levels over time as the federal needs to take actions to combat high inflation.Credit performance remains strong across our commercial businesses with only 6 basis points of net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. Total consumer net charge-offs increased 88 million from the third quarter to 48 basis points of average loans, driven by an increase in net charge-offs in the Credit Card portfolio but remained slightly below consumer net charge-off levels in the fourth quarter of 2019. Nonperforming assets increased 1% from the third quarter as lower residential mortgage nonaccrual loans were more than offset by higher commercial real estate nonaccrual loans. Our allowance for credit losses increased 397 million in the fourth quarter, primarily reflecting loan growth, as well as a less favorable economic environment. We are closely monitoring our portfolio for potential risk and are continuing to take some targeted actions to further tighten underwriting standards.Let me highlight trends in two of our portfolios. The size of our Auto portfolios declined for three consecutive quarters, and balances were down 5% at the end of 2022 compared to year-end 2021. Meanwhile, originations were down 47% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago which reflected credit tightening actions and continued price competition due to rising interest rates. Of note, our new vehicle originations surpassed used vehicles in the fourth quarter, reflecting a combination of credit tightening actions that we've implemented and the industry dynamic of higher new vehicle sales growth. Turning to the commercial real estate office portfolio. The office market is showing signs of weakness due to weak demand, driving higher vacancy rates and deteriorating operating performance, as well as challenging economic and capital market conditions.While we haven't seen this translate to significant loss content yet, we do expect to see stress over time and are proactively working with borrowers to manage our exposure and being disciplined in our underwriting standards with both, outstanding balances and credits down compared to a year ago. On Slide 8, we highlight loans and deposits. Average loans grew 8% from a year ago and 3.1 billion from the third quarter. Period-end loans increased for the sixth consecutive quarter with growth across our commercial portfolios and higher consumer loans driven by credit card and residential loans, partially offset by continued declines in our Auto portfolio. I'll highlight the specific growth drivers when discussing our operating segment results. Average loan yields increased 181 basis points from a year ago and 85 basis points from the third quarter, reflecting the higher rate environment.Average deposits declined 6% from a year ago and 2% from the third quarter. Compared with the third quarter, we saw declines in each of our business. Lower consumer balances reflected customers continuing to reallocate cash in higher-yielding alternatives, particularly in Wealth and Investment Management and continued consumer spending. As expected, our average deposit cost increased 32 basis points from the third quarter to 46 basis points, driven by higher deposit costs across all operating segments in response to rising interest rates. Average deposit costs are up 44 basis points since the fourth quarter of 2021, while market rates have increased substantially more during that same time. As rates continue to rise, we would expect deposit betas to continue to increase in customer migration from lower yielding to higher yielding deposit products to continue.Turning to net interest income on Slide 9. Fourth-quarter net interest income was 13.4 billion, which was 45% higher than a year ago, as we continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates. I'll provide details on our 2023 expectations later on the call. Turning to expenses on Slide 10. The increase in noninterest expense from both, a year ago and from the third quarter was driven by higher operating losses. Excluding operating losses, other noninterest expense was flat from a year ago as higher severance expense was offset by lower revenue-related compensation and continued progress on our efficiency initiatives. Our operating losses in the fourth quarter included accruals related to the December 2022 CFPB consent order. As part of that settlement, we agreed to one incremental remediation and one new remediation related to overdraft fees.The accrual related to these two remediations was approximately 350 million. Our operating losses in the fourth quarter also included accruals for other legal actions. And reflecting these accruals, our current estimate of the high end of the range of reasonably possible losses and accessible for legal actions as of December 31, 2022, is approximately 1.4 billion. This is down approximately 2.3 billion from September 30, 2022. While we still have outstanding litigation resolved, this estimate would be the lowest level since the second quarter of 2016, though, of course, new matters will arise and existing matters will develop over time. The estimate for December 31, 2022, will be updated at the time of our 10-K filing in February and may change.While we acknowledge the elevated level of operating losses, the past two quarters has been significant. They are important steps in putting historical issues behind us as we've been able to absorb the cost while increasing our CET1 ratio as I highlighted earlier. Turning to our operating segments, starting with Consumer Banking and Lending on Slide 11. Consumer and Small Business Banking revenue increased 36% from a year ago, driven by the impact of higher interest rates. Deposit-related fees continued to decline as we completed the rollout of the overdraft fee reductions and new product enhancements that we announced early last year to help customers avoid overdraft fees. The majority of the revenue impact of these changes was reflected in the fourth-quarter run rate.We continue to focus on branch rationalization as digital adoption and usage among our customers have steadily increased. In 2022, we reduced branches by 179 and branch staffing levels by 10%, and we expect to continue to optimize our branches and staffing levels in response to changing customer needs. While industry mortgage rates declined in the fourth quarter, they were still up over 330 basis points since the beginning of the year, and weekly mortgage applications as measured by the Mortgage Bankers Association were at a 26-year low at quarter end. The economic incentive to refinance is extremely limited. And refinance applications for the industry were down 87% in December compared to a year ago. Reflecting these market conditions, our Home Lending revenue declined 57% from a year ago, driven by lower mortgage originations and gain-on sale margins, as well as lower revenue from the resecuritization of loans purchased from securitization pools.We expect the mortgage origination market will continue to be challenging and gain-on sale margin or remain under pressure until excess capacity industry has been removed. As we announced this week, we will be exiting our correspondent business, which we expect to be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter. We don't expect this action to have a significant impact on our 2023 financial results. Credit Card revenue was up 6% from a year ago due to higher loan balances driven by higher point of sale volume and new product launches. Auto revenue declined 12% from the year ago driven by continued loan spread compression from rising rates and credit tightening actions in certain areas, as well as lower loan balances. Personal Lending was up 9% from a year ago due to higher loan balances, partially offset by lower spread compression.While originations grew 19% from the year ago driven by strong consumer demand in investments and the business, we have remained disciplined in our underwriting. Turning to key business drivers on Slide 12. Mortgage originations declined 70% from a year ago and 32% from the third quarter, with both declines in correspondent and retail and originations. Refinances as a percentage of total originations were over half of our volume a year ago to -- declined to 13% in the fourth quarter of 2022. I already highlighted the drivers of the decline in Auto originations. So, turning to debit card. Spending was up 1% compared to a year ago. Holiday spend for debit card was flat compared to the 2021 season with lower transaction volume, offset by higher average ticket size.Entertainment was the only category with double-digit spending while growth -- while categories such as home improvement, general retail goods, and fuel were all down compared to 2021. Credit Card spending increased 17% from a year ago, and while the year-over-year growth rate slowed from the third quarter. Almost all categories continue to have double-digit growth. Average balances were up 22% from a year ago. Payment rates have started to moderate, but we're still well above pre-pandemic levels. Turning to Commercial Banking results on Slide 13. Middle market banking revenue increased 78% from a year ago, driven by higher net interest income due to the impact of higher rates and higher loan balances. Asset-based lending and leasing revenue declined 4% from a year ago, driven by lower net gains from equity securities, partially offset by loan growth.Average loan balances were up 18% in the fourth quarter compared to a year ago, while growth in the first half of 2022 was driven by higher realization. Utilization rates stabilized in the second half of the year. Average loan balances have grown for six consecutive quarters and were up 5% in the third quarter, with growth in asset-based lending and leasing driven by continued growth in client inventory, which are still below pre-pandemic levels. Growth in middle market banking was driven by larger clients, including both, new and existing relationships, which more than offset declines from our smaller customers. Turning to Corporate and Investment Banking on Slide 14. Banking revenue increased 22% from a year ago driven by stronger treasury management results due to the impact of higher interest rates, as well as improved lending results.Investment banking fees declined from a year ago, reflecting lower market activity with declines across all products and industries. Commercial real estate revenue grew 16% from a year ago driven by stronger lending results to a higher loan balances and the impact of higher interest rates. Markets revenues increased 17% from a year ago, driven by higher trading revenue in equities, rates and commodities, foreign exchange, and municipal products. Average loans grew 10% from a year ago after growing for seventh consecutive quarter, average loans declined from the third quarter as utilization rates stabilized across most portfolios. On Slide 15, Wealth and Investment Management revenue was up 1% compared to a year ago, as the increase in net interest income driven by the impact of higher rates was partially offset by lower asset-based fees due to the decrease in market valuations.The majority of win in advisory assets are priced at the beginning of the quarter, so asset-based increased slightly in the first quarter, reflecting the higher market valuations at the end of the year. Expenses decreased 6% from a year ago, driven by lower revenue-related compensation and the impact of efficiency initiatives. Even as loan growth in securities-based lending moderated due to demand caused by market volatility in the interest rate environment, average loans grew 1% from a year ago. Slide 16 highlights our corporate results. Both revenue and expenses were impacted by the divestitures last year of our Corporate Trust business in Wells Fargo Asset Management. We sold these businesses in the fourth quarter of 2021, which resulted in a net gain of 943 million.Revenue also declined from a year ago due to lower results in our affiliated venture capital and private equity businesses, including the impairments in equity securities I highlighted earlier. The increase in expenses from a year ago was driven by higher operating losses. Turning to our expectations for '23, starting with Slide 17. Let me start by highlighting our expectations for net interest income. We are assuming that -- we are assuming the asset cap will remain in place throughout the year. Moving from left to right on the waterfall, based on the current forward rate curve, we expect our net interest income will continue to benefit from the impact of higher rates, even with deposits repricing faster than they did in 2022. However, this benefit is expected to be partially offset by continued deposit runoff and mix shift to higher-yielding products with these declines, partially offset by modest loan growth.We also expect a headwind for lower CIB Markets net interest income due to higher funding costs. This reduction is expected to be partially offset by an increase in trading gains and noninterest income, so the impact to revenue is currently expected to be small. Putting this all together, we currently expect net interest income to grow by approximately 10% in 2023 versus 2022. Ultimately, the amount of net interest income we earned in 2023 will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are uncertain, including the absolute level of interest rates, the shape of the yield curve, deposit balances, mix, and pricing in the loan demand. Turning to our 2023 expense outlook on Slide 18. Following the waterfall from left to right, we reported 57.3 billion in noninterest expense in 2022, which included 7 billion of operating losses.Excluding operating losses, expenses would have been 50.3 billion, which is -- which was in line with the guidance we provided at the beginning of last year. If you also exclude operating losses from the guidance, our 2022 expenses were impacted by inflation and higher severance expense. However, revenue-related expenses were lower than expected by market conditions. So, we believe a good starting point for discussion of 2023 expenses was 50.3 billion, which excludes operating losses. We expect expenses in 2023 to increase by approximately $1 billion due to both, merit increases, including inflationary pressures and an approximately $250 million increase in FDIC expense related to the previously announced surcharge. These increases are expected to be partially offset by approximately 100 million of lower revenue-related expense, primarily driven by decreases in loan lending.Based on current market levels, we expect revenue-related expense in Wealth and Investment Management for 2023 to be similar to 2022. We've successfully delivered on our commitment of approximately 7.5 billion of gross expense saves over the past two years. And through our efficiency initiatives, we expect to realize an additional 3.2 billion of gross expense reductions in 2023. A piece of this is related to the announcement we made earlier this week to create a more focused Home Lending business, but expense savings from reducing our servicing business will take more time to be realized. We highlighted on this slide the largest opportunities for additional savings this year, and we believe we'll have more opportunities beyond 2023. Similar to prior years, the resources needed to address our risk and control work separate from our efficiency initiatives.And we will continue to add resources as necessary to complete this important work. And while we continue to focus on executing our efficiency initiatives, we're also continuing to invest and expect approximately 1.7 billion of incremental investments in our businesses in 2023. As Charlie discussed, investing in our businesses is critical to our growth across the company and better serve our customers, but we'll also continue to be thoughtful and evaluate the level of investments throughout the year. So, putting this all together, expenses, excluding operating losses, are expected to be relatively flat in 2023 compared with 2022, even with inflationary pressures, a higher FDI surcharge, and increase incremental investments in our businesses.As 2022 demonstrated, operating losses can be significant and hard to predict, and therefore, we have not included them in our expense outlook for 2023. However, we currently anticipate ongoing business-related operating losses, such as fraud, theft, and other business-as-usual losses to be approximately 1.3 billion this year, which is the same assumption we provided last year. As previously disclosed, we had an outstanding litigation -- have outstanding litigation, regulatory, and customer remediation matters that could impact the amount of operating losses. It's important to note that while we made substantial progress executing on our efficiency initiatives, we still have a significant opportunity to get more efficient across the company.This remains a multiyear process with the goal of achieving an efficiency ratio along with our peers based on our business mix. Given how critical continuing to invest to our -- continue to invest in our story, on Slide 19, we provide details on our primary areas of focus for 2023. As we've highlighted, continuing to build the right risk and control of infrastructure remains our top priority, and we will continue to invest in this important work. Charlie discussed many of the investments we started to make in digital payments, and we plan to continue to invest in these areas this year to make improvements for both our consumer and commercial customers. We also plan to continue to invest to expand our client coverage and investment banking, Commercial Banking, and Wealth and Investment Management and to continue to transform our technology platforms, including moving more applications to cloud, consolidating our data centers, and increasing investments in cyber.Finally, by investing in our operations and branches, we expect not only to improve the customer experience, but also improve efficiency, reduce operational risk, and drive and account growth. As we show on Slide 20, in the fourth quarter, we reported an 8% ROTCE. But as I highlighted at the start of the call, our fourth-quarter results were impacted by several notable items, including higher operating losses, elevated impairments of equity securities, severance, and discrete tax benefits. As we show on this slide, you will -- if you exclude these notable items, our fourth-quarter ROTCE would have been approximately 16%. However, we don't believe this accurately reflects our longer-term expectations for the following reasons. Net interest income was higher than our long-term expectations due to interest rates, funding, penalties, mix, and pricing, Also, net loan charge-offs were at historically low levels.If rates, funding balances, mix, and pricing were closer to our long-term expectations and charge-offs were higher, our ROTCE would be lower. Depending on what adjustments you make here, we may all get to a slightly different answer. So, to be clear, because the interest rates are higher and freight costs are lower than our longer-term expectations, we believe we have more work to do to improve our returns. On Slide 21, we highlight our path to higher returns. Since we first discussed our ROTCE goal in the earnings call for the fourth quarter of 2020, we have executed on a number of important items. We executed a $20 billion of gross common stock repurchases, 16 billion in net issuances, including our 401(k) plan. We increased our common stock dividend from $0.10 to $0.30 per share.We delivered approximately 7.5 billion of gross expense saves and reduced headcount by 11% since the end of 2020. So, we've made good progress over the past two years on things that we can control, and we believe we have a clear line of sight to a sustainable ROTCE of approximately 15% in the medium term. In order to achieve that, we need to continue to optimize our capital, including returning capital to shareholders and redeploying capital to higher-returning products and businesses. Adding more focus on our Home Lending business should also be a positive contributor to higher returns. We also have additional opportunities to execute on efficiency initiatives. Additionally, we expect to benefit from the investments we are planning in our businesses, which I highlighted earlier.While some of these investments will be dependent on the market environment, we expect them to increase ROTCE. At the same time, we will continue to prioritize building our risk and control infrastructure. In the longer term, we believe that running a company in a more controlled and disciplined manner will continue to benefit returns. And our goal is for our four operating segments to produce returns comparable to our best peers. In summary, although the high level of operating losses we had in the fourth quarter significantly impacted our results, the underlying results in the quarter continue to reflect an improvement in our earnings capacity. As we look forward, we expect to continue to grow net interest income. And our expenses, excluding operating losses, are expected to be relatively flat even after inflation and incremental investments in our businesses to drive growth.Both our credit performance and capital levels remained strong in the fourth quarter. And we expect to resume share repurchases in the first quarter. We will now take your questions.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

(NYSE: PFE) today announced that it has significantly expanded its commitment to An Accord for a Healthier World to offer the full portfolio of medicines and vaccines for which it has global rights on a not-for-profit basis to enable greater health for 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower-income countries.Launched in May 2022, the Accord, a transformative initiative focused on greatly reducing health inequities that exist between many lower-income countries and the rest of the world, initially included a commitment from Pfizer for access to all its patented medicines and vaccines available in the U.S. or European Union on a not-for-profit basis to 45 lower-income countries. However, to better align with disease burden and unmet patient needs in these countries, Pfizer will now expand its offering under the Accord to include off-patent products, bringing the total offering from 23 products to around 500 products.The Accord portfolio offering now includes both patented and off-patent medicines and vaccines that treat or prevent many of the greatest infectious and non-communicable disease threats faced today in lower-income countries. This includes chemotherapies and oral cancer treatments that have the potential to treat nearly one million new cancer cases in Accord countries each year1. It also includes a wide range of antibiotics, that can help to address the rising morbidity, mortality and costs associated with antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and help to prevent around 1.5 million deaths that occur each year in these countries as a result of bacterial infections in hospitals and community health clinics2. As Pfizer launches new medicines and vaccines, those products will also be included in the Accord portfolio on a not-for-profit basis.Story continues""We launched the Accord to help reduce the glaring health equity gap that exists in our world. Our hope is to empower country governments and co-create solutions with them and other multi-sector partners to break down many of the system-level barriers to better health. In the months since the Accord’s launch, we have heard resoundingly from these leaders that access to a broader and more immediate scope of consistent, high-quality products is needed for meaningful and sustainable transformation. We believe this expansion of our product offering, combined with continued efforts to help address the barriers that limit or prevent access, will help us to achieve and even expedite our vision of a world where all people have access to the medicines and vaccines they need to live longer and healthier lives,"" said Pfizer Chairman and CEO Albert Bourla.Since its launch in May 2022, An Accord for a Healthier World continues to make progress towards its goals to help address global health equity through both medicine and vaccine supply and health system strengthening. Rwanda has already received delivery of nine Pfizer medicines and vaccines for the treatment of certain cancers, infectious and inflammatory diseases. In collaboration with the Rwandan Ministry of Health, Pfizer has provided professional healthcare education and training to support the delivery, and in November, Pfizer deployed its first Global Health Team to the country to help identify opportunities for long-term supply chain optimization. Collaboration is also underway with the Ministries of Health in Malawi, Ghana and Senegal as well as a number of other Accord countries to better understand the critical healthcare needs and opportunities for health system strengthening.""The Accord is an important step toward sustainable health security for Rwanda and the broader continent. The expanded portfolio offering, combined with public health system strengthening efforts, will further enhance our progress and offer valuable support to key national health initiatives that lead to positive health outcomes,"" said His Excellency Paul Kagame, President of Rwanda.About An Accord for a Healthier WorldAn Accord for a Healthier World is working to close the health equity gap that persists between wealthy nations and many lower-income countries. The initiative is focused on enabling greater access to healthcare for 1.2 billion people living in 45 lower-income countries, including all 27 low-income countries as well as 18 lower-middle-income countries that have transitioned from low to lower-middle-income classification in the last ten years.

Following this approval, VLA2001 became the first COVID-19 vaccine to receive standard marketing authorization in Europe.The EC’s decision to grant approval to VLA2001 was based on positive top-line data from the pivotal phase III Cov-Compare study, which evaluated VLA2001 against AstraZeneca’s AZN COVID vaccine, AZD1222. The study achieved both co-primary endpoints two weeks after the second vaccination dose. Data from this study demonstrated the superiority of VLA2001 over AstraZeneca’s AZD1222. Valneva’s COVID-19 vaccine produced superior neutralizing antibody titer levels to AstraZeneca’s vaccine. VLA2001 demonstrated the same effectiveness as the AstraZeneca vaccine in neutralizing antibody seroconversion rates by more than 95%.Prior to securing the marketing approval in the EU, Valneva also entered into an advance purchase agreement (“APA”) with the EC in November 2021 to supply up to 60 million doses of VLA2001 to the EU member states once the vaccine is granted marketing authorization.One of the terms of this APA provided the EC with the right to terminate the agreement if VLA2001 does not receive marketing authorization in the EU by Apr 30, 2022. The EC decided to exercise this right in May 2022 and communicated its intent to terminate the APA. Following remediation discussions between the EC and Valneva, the former approved an amendment to the APA, revising the supply down to 1.25 million doses of the vaccine. The amended APA also allows EC to purchase another 1.25 million doses.Story continuesThis reduced order received from the EC resulted in management evaluating its COVID-19 program. Though this low order volume does not put pressure on its existing cash resources, management has suspended internal and terminated external manufacturing of VLA2001 doses. Management has also accelerated the wind-down of VLA2001-related activities and lowered its guidance for R&amp;D expenses for 2022.Currently, Valneva is focused on developing vaccine candidates in its pipeline targeting Lyme disease and chikungunya.Valneva is developing VLA15, its vaccine candidate for Lyme disease. The candidate is being developed in collaboration with Pfizer PFE. Last August, Pfizer and Valneva initiated a phase III study to evaluate VLA15 in individuals aged five years and older. The initiation of the study has also triggered a milestone payment of $25 million payable by Pfizer to Valneva.Last month, both Valneva and Pfizer reported six-month antibody persistence data from a phase II study in patients who completed a three-dose or a two-dose vaccination schedule of VLA15. While antibody levels in both schedules remained above baseline, they were higher in participants who received the three-dose vaccination schedule. These results validate incorporating a three-dose vaccination schedule in the above-mentioned phase III study.Last month, Valneva announced that it had completed the rolling BLA submission with the FDA, which seeks approval to use its single-shot chikungunya vaccine, VLA1553, in adults. A regulatory filing for the vaccine in Europe is expected later this year.If approved, VLA1553 will be the first vaccine for chikungunya and will be eligible for a priority review voucher. The vaccine has already been granted Breakthrough Therapy and Fast Track designations by the FDA and PRIME designation by the EMA.Valneva SE Sponsored ADR Price Valneva SE Sponsored ADR PriceValneva SE Sponsored ADR price | Valneva SE Sponsored ADR Quote Zacks Rank &amp; Stock to ConsiderValneva currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

In fact, many of them also struggled in 2021. So after an amazing bull run, it’s been several years of pain for growth investors. That said, the destruction has left a number of cheap growth stocks in its wake.The problem? “Cheap” is relative to the buyer, and not all buyers view these stocks as cheap. In many cases, they’re not cheap by traditional measures.Lastly, valuation is up to interpretation and is highly dependent on the investing environment. When we were in a raging bull market, valuations were not able to cap some of the monstrous runs we saw in stocks. They did not cap the gains and did not restrict the stocks from flying higher.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsNow that we’re in a punishing bear market, valuations alone aren’t enough to prop stocks up. Just because something is cheap, that doesn’t mean it can’t get cheaper.With some of that in mind, let’s look at a few cheap growth stocks to own for the years ahead.TickerCompanyCurrent PriceAMDAdvanced Micro Devices$70.30PYPLPayPal$79.74TSLATesla$120.62LULULululemon Athletica$312.27DISDisney$99.03Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)AMD (AMD) sign outside of office building with greenerySource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD)  finds itself just 30% above its 52-week low after a recent pullback. The stock has lagged its peers, like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), although the two have suffered similar peak-to-trough declines.AMD CEO Lisa Su deserves a ton of respect after the last five years. She has totally transformed the business by reducing debt, increasing revenue and becoming profitable and free-cash-flow positive. She put the business in a financial position to close its acquisition of Xilinx for roughly $50 billion.That’s a huge acquisition and while Xilinx wasn’t known for its robust growth necessarily, it does have solid margins and consistent free cash flow.Admittedly, earnings estimates have come down for AMD. However, with shares down more than 49% from their 52-week high, one would think earnings would at least decline for the year. Instead, analysts expect 6% revenue growth in 2023 and 4% earnings growth.Story continuesFor this, we’re paying just under 19 times earnings. If AMD retests the lows, it will trade at less than 16 times earnings (provided estimates don’t collapse.)Cheap Growth Stocks: PayPal (PYPL)PayPal logo overlays daylight photo of corporate buildingSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) stock saw an explosive gain after Covid-19, but shares have paid the price amid the fallout in growth stocks. I don’t know that it would have really mattered, but PayPal’s association with crypto and high growth put a target on the stock’s back.Now, though, the narrative has changed — at least in my mind. The company has raised its earnings outlook in two consecutive quarters, even though the share price has recently probed new 52-week lows. Consensus expectations now call for 9% revenue growth in fiscal 2023 and roughly 17% earnings growth. Admittedly, that comes after a year where 2022 earnings likely fell about 11%.Still though, it leaves shares trading at just 16.6 times forward earnings. That’s too cheap for a stock that can put together double-digit earnings and revenue growth.Tesla (TSLA)Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TXSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.comOne of the darlings of the last bull market, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is finally losing its charge. The stock has been absolutely buried lately, suffering a peak-to-trough decline of about 75% while falling in five consecutive months and losing 67% amid that stretch.Some investors blame it on CEO Elon Musk and his purchase of Twitter. Others blame it on the current investment environment, rising interest rates and a potential recession. In reality, the “why” doesn’t matter. What matters is interpreting whether it’s a good company or not.While the company may be facing demand problems in China and its fourth-quarter delivery results disappointed Wall Street, the fact is, Tesla still churned out record production last quarter. The automaker is the global leader in electric vehicles (EVs) with a strong energy business and surprisingly solid financials.Tesla has more than enough capital to manage through an economic downturn, while estimates still call for solid growth.Expectations for 2022 may prove to be too optimistic, but they currently call for 79% earnings growth on top of 53% revenue growth. Estimates for 2023 call for revenue of roughly $110 billion, up 34%, and earnings of just more than $5 per share, up almost 25%.Presently, that leaves Tesla stock trading at roughly 23 times 2023 earnings.Lululemon Athletica (LULU)Lululemon storefront in a mall. People shop inside the store among the clothes. LULU stock.Source: lentamart / ShutterstockIt’s been a while since we’ve looked at Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU), but the recent price action demands that we do. Shares recently fell almost 10% in a single session after the company warned about the recent quarter.Instead of a slight gross margin expansion, the company experienced a slight gross margin contraction. However, revenue in the quarter came in a bit stronger than expected, while earnings were near the midpoint of the prior guide.In other words, a little more sales than expected, a little worse margins than expected and the end result is about the same amount of earnings. Did shares really deserve to hit multi-month lows on the news?I don’t think so, but what I think doesn’t really matter. However, we can look at this top-tier retailer and make a case for owning it. Estimates call for double-digit revenue and earnings growth this year and next year, including growth in excess of 25% for both categories in 2022. In fact, estimates are pretty strong for the next several years.At current levels, shares trade around 27 times this year’s earnings. That’s not exactly in the normal territory of cheap growth stocks. However, it’s cheap for Lululemon stock, which is a high-quality business.From this week’s low, another 14% decline would send Lululemon to new 52-week lows. I’m not saying that will happen, but if it does (and estimates don’t take a big hit), shares will trade at a more reasonable 25 times earnings.Disney (DIS)Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.Source: chrisdorney / ShutterstockI’m not sure how many people would consider Disney (NYSE:DIS) a growth stock, but with its booming stake in streaming video, I consider it to be. The risk with Disney is pretty clear, though. Its streaming business hasn’t turn a profit yet and the company faces a potential slowdown if a recession materializes.That said, analysts expect about 8% revenue growth this year and 7% next year. For earnings, those expectations are higher, at 17% and 28.5%, respectively.I also don’t know what valuation is “too low” to ignore for Wall Street. However, in the $75 to $80 range, Disney gets tough to ignore from a technical perspective and a fundamental one. Assuming the earnings estimates don’t change too much, Disney would trade at sub-20 times earnings.On the date of publication, Bret Kenwell held a long position in PYPL.

Read this and more market news on the go with Yahoo Finance App.Half a world away, big tech is in a world of its own.Yours truly and our very own Julie Hyman are on the ground again in Davos, Switzerland for the 53rd World Economic Forum this week.On Saturday afternoon, in a ritual I've developed having attended several of WEFs, I walked up and down the ""Promenade"" to breathe in the environment and observe.In a way, the exercise focuses my mind before I stay awake to churn out stories, chat up the powerful, and expand my iPhone contacts list.People walk during snowfall on the Promenade road, ahead of the World Economic Forum (WEF) 2023 in the Alpine resort of Davos, Switzerland, January 15, 2023. REUTERS/Arnd WiegmannThe Promenade is where big businesses such as IBM, Salesforce, and Qualcomm set up little houses to wine and dine potential customers — and in some cases toss lavish nighttime parties. In recent years, crypto has had a large presence on the Promenade, and outside these locations you'll often find a host of colorful looking characters pontificating on bitcoin $1,000,000.Amid the FTX fallout, the often bizarre crypto crews with limited badge access to key buildings have mostly rolled out of town — although there is an undercurrent of stablecoin-focused companies still beating the drum on their own awesomeness this year.Most surprising to me this year, though, is the dominant showing of Big Tech companies at WEF despite the likes of Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Salesforce (CRM) laying off thousands of workers amid sharp slowdowns in sales and profits.Amazon, SAP, Meta, IBM, Salesforce, and Zoom all have cool installations on the Promenade. Their coffee machines look great inside, as does the furniture. It's as if tech isn't in a recession of its own!Story continuesThese snazzy setups are surely expensive — not to mention the cost of sending representatives to spread the gospel in Davos, sit in on a few provoking panels in the Congress Center, and maybe close a few deals.Meta's stock is down 65% in the past year. The company is in the process of firing 11,000 workers. Yet, it's party on for Meta at this year's World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Photo source: Brian Sozzi/Yahoo Finance""Tech stalwarts are used to spending money like 1980 rockstars, and Davos is just another notch on the belt,"" Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives tells me. ""While layoffs are now on the doorstep and 2022 was a horror show year for tech stocks, these firms need to keep the foot on the marketing spending gas pedal as it’s an arms race in the tech world.""Some will say WEF is the most cost-efficient way to meet very powerful people all in one place and set the table for making money in the future. I get it, and agree to a certain extent. After all, I'm here, too.But the tech recession is real, and is likely not ending in 2023 amid elevated interest rates.Maybe it would have been good for Big Tech to give a nod to their now-former employees and currently hurting investors and reel it in at Davos 2023?For some, perhaps they shouldn't even be in attendance given how far their fundamentals and stock prices have fallen. I think a more measured approach would have sent a needed signal to markets that tech execs are listening, and want to get out of this funk before 2025.Alas, they are here in force. So in that regard, let's see what the nighttime parties bring, I suppose.We'll have more on that this week along with a host of massive interviews featuring a Who's Who in global business, so I encourage you to stay highly engaged with Yahoo Finance Live for these market-moving discussions.Happy Trading!What to Watch TodayEconomy8:30 A.M.

The analyst kept a Buy rating and a $14 price target on Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) shares.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 35 hedge funds were long Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) at the end of Q3 2022, up from 26 funds in the last quarter.

The distinction belongs to Sperry-Rand’s subsidiary UNIVAC, which introduced the first commercially successful computers in the early 1950s. In this era, IBM did possess the largest research and development department of the business machines industry and quickly caught up, introducing cost-competitive computers a few years after UNIVAC. By the late 1950s, IBM held the dominant market share in computers. IBM also touted a vastly superior sales organization, which used a sales tactic called “paper machines” (the equivalent of today’s “vaporware”). If a competitor’s product was selling well in a market segment that IBM had yet to penetrate, the company would announce a competing product and start taking orders for the “paper machine” long before it was available.

The company has been transitioning to more of a software-as-a service (SaaS) business model that has, we believe, temporarily depressed earnings and cash flow. We like Splunk’s leadership position in the industry and the company has installed a new CEO and is rolling out new features and products.”8. New Relic, Inc.

Here’s what the fund said:“Michael Dell has created substantial value for shareholders since re-listing the company several years ago. Earlier this year, Dell Technologies announced that it would be spinning its $50 billion stake in VMWare, which we believe will unlock the under-appreciated value of the Dell server and PC businesses. Dell’s best attribute has been strong free cash flow generation, which the company has used to de-lever and create significant latent value for equity holders. Looking ahead, we believe this core Dell business, which still trades at a discount to its hardware peer group, should instead command a premium multiple thanks to its leading market share, profitability, and impressive execution. There are few large cap companies which possess a nearly 10% FCF yield, 2.5% dividend yield and 1.5x leverage ratio; Dell is one of them.”6. MongoDB, Inc.

(NASDAQ:MDB) to gain exposure to the big data industry. ClearBridge Investments made the following comment about MongoDB, Inc.

163,c20565a4-0339-3cef-bf4c-06596de9a4e4,IBM,2023-01-17,International Business Machines Corporation (IBM) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/international-business-machines-corporation-ibm-140002661.html,1673877602,STORY,['IBM'],"[IBM (IBM) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this technology and consulting company have returned +4.1%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's no change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Integrated Systems industry, which IBM falls in, has lost 2.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.IBM is expected to post earnings of $3.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +6.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.The consensus earnings estimate of $9.12 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +15%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $9.69 indicates a change of +6.3% from what IBM is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for IBM.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for IBM _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For IBM, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $15.49 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -7.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $59.32 billion and $59.9 billion estimates indicate -16.2% and +1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryIBM reported revenues of $14.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -19.9%. EPS of $1.81 for the same period compares with $2.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.73 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.72%. The EPS surprise was +1.69%.Over the last four quarters, IBM surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.IBM is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about IBM. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But every investor is virtually certain to have both over-performing and under-performing stocks. At this point some shareholders may be questioning their investment in Molson Coors Beverage Company (NYSE:TAP), since the last five years saw the share price fall 40%.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. View our latest analysis for Molson Coors Beverage To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Molson Coors Beverage became profitable within the last five years. Most would consider that to be a good thing, so it's counter-intuitive to see the share price declining. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.The revenue fall of 1.5% per year for five years is neither good nor terrible. But if the market expected durable top line growth, then that could explain the share price weakness.You can see how earnings and revenue have changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-and-revenue-growthMolson Coors Beverage is well known by investors, and plenty of clever analysts have tried to predict the future profit levels. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Molson Coors Beverage will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Molson Coors Beverage the TSR over the last 5 years was -32%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Molson Coors Beverage shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 1.1% over one year. That's including the dividend. That certainly beats the loss of about 6% per year over the last half decade. The long term loss makes us cautious, but the short term TSR gain certainly hints at a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

""This expansion project is yet another example of an investment we made during the depths of the pandemic that will support our employees, further improve our ability to deliver great service and set United up for success in 2023 and beyond.""Story continuesNew United flight attendants will go through a six-week and a half training course at the Houston facility and then return every 18 months to stay current on their qualifications.

The centerpiece of the building is a new Aquatic Center that includes a 125,000-gallon pool to practicing the safe evacuation of the plane in the unlikely event of a water landing.As part of the construction of the facility, and in support of Mayor Turner's climate action plan to build local storm-resilient infrastructure, United included an underground prefabricated storm detention vault that can hold more than 268,000 gallons of water and store stormwater runoff in large underground pipes or vaults.""United continues to be a great partner and business leader in the city of Houston, connecting Houstonians to the world and investing in vital infrastructure projects that help enhance the travel experience for millions of travelers,"" said Mayor Turner. ""I congratulate United on opening its global Inflight Training Center, a testament to the region's workforce and pro-business environment.""Commitment to HoustonUnited has operated for more than 70 years from its hub at George Bush Intercontinental Airport (IAH).and is one of the largest employers with over 11,000 local employees and plans to hire 1,800 more in 2023. The airline maintains a corporate office presence downtown and is the leading carrier at George Bush Intercontinental/Houston Airport (IAH), with about 400 flights per day and more direct flights to Latin America and the Caribbean than any other airline.According to a new study by Compass Lexecon, United's IAH hub and spending by foreign visitors to Houston on United and Star Alliance member flights support an estimated $5.3 billion per year in gross domestic product in Texas and in 2022 United's direct employment in Houston contributed $1.2 billion to economic activity. The study also showed that United's Houston hub indirectly supported an additional 56,000 local jobs through airport and supply chain activity.The airline's ongoing investments and commitments to its Houston operation contribute to the positive, ripple-effect on the broader, local economy:As part of the City of Houston's $1.3 billion Terminal Redevelopment Program (ITRP), United redesigned ticketing counters as well as new pre-check and CLEAR lanes, and state of the art TSA security checkpoint, which has become a model for the continued technological enhancements in the travel journey.United's new Baggage Handling System services Terminals C and E and features state-of-the-art technology, including seven baggage carousels with corresponding high-tech displays, a complete replacement of the old outbound baggage system with a four-loop sorting system, as well as a new Baggage Control Center to monitor and manage the entire baggage handling operation.The airline's Early Baggage System (EBS) facility is under construction, is expected to go online late this year and will be the first of its kind in North America – it temporarily stores bags that arrive early in a separate location until their specific departure. This new facility will allow United the flexibility to use all available gates and enable future growth at the airport.United recently launched Calibrate, a 36-month apprenticeship program to grow and diversify the airline's pipeline of aircraft technicians and chose Houston for its first cohort. Through Calibrate, United plans to train 1,000 new aircraft technicians by 2026 – with a goal of at least half being women or people of color.United gave $590,000 in cash and in-kind contributions to Houston-area non-profits last year, including a longstanding relationship with the Houston Food Bank where employees volunteer to sort, box/bag food, and stack products for distribution.United's collaboration with the Houston Independent School District is a cornerstone to United's commitment to inspire a new generation of diverse aviation leaders. Fifty Sterling High School students currently enrolled in the school's aviation program are partnered with Houston-based United employees who provided support and guidance as they look to pursue a career in the aviation industry, including pilots and aircraft mechanics.About UnitedUnited's shared purpose is ""Connecting People.

167,7e6dc24b-6853-3d49-8327-14e288cb03a2,UAL,2023-01-17,Buy Delta or United Airlines Stock as Earnings Season Continues?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-delta-united-airlines-stock-004012691.html,1673916012,STORY,"['DAL', 'UAL']","[Airline stocks have continued to move higher over the last few weeks, with the industry highlighting an area of the economy that could see growth in 2023.The Transportation-Airline Industry is currently in the top 20% of over 250 Zacks Industries as travel demand is expected to be higher this year, driven by lingering pent-up demand following the pandemic.With Delta Air Lines DAL recently reporting Q4 earnings last Friday and United Airlines UAL set to report on January 17, let’s see which stock may be the better buy at the moment.DAL Review Delta kicked off a much-anticipated earnings season among airline stocks that hopefully shows continued improvement and recovery on their top and bottom lines.This was the case for Delta, with the company highlighting that consumer demand remains robust and drove strong demand through its fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, which saw operating revenue of $12.3 billion–8% higher than Q4 pre-pandemic levels in 2019.Delta’s total revenue of $13.43 billion beat expectations by 3% and increased 43% year over year. On the bottom line, earnings ended up topping the Zacks consensus by 15% at $1.48 per share and rebounded 573% YoY.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchUAL Preview Delta’s impressive report is another reason to be optimistic about other airliners set to report later in the month. United Airlines, in particular, is expected to post EPS of $2.07 compared to -$1.60 in Q4 2021. This is in line with the most accurate estimate with an earnings surprise not expected. Still, Delta’s earnings beat makes the possibility of United topping expectations more plausible. And on the top line, United’s Q4 sales are forecasted to grow 49% YoY to $12.23 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPerformance &amp; Momentum Both Delta and United sport an “A” Style Scores grade for Momentum. With much optimism surrounding consumer demand for travel in 2023, UAL stock is up +34% in the last month to trade near its highs Vs. DALs + 15%. Both stocks have largely outperformed the broader indexes with UAL also topping the Transportation-Airline Markets +15% while DAL is on par with this pace.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, over the last decade, DAL is now up +181% to beat UAL’s +108% and also top the benchmark. While UAL has lagged behind the S&amp;P 500 its performance has outpaced the Transportation-Airline Markets +33% during this period.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation After such impressive rallies over the last month, it is important to monitor the valuation of Delta and United Airlines stock.To that note, Delta sticks out trading at $38 per share and just 7.04X forward earnings which is nicely below the industry average of 12.6X. Shares of Delta trade 77% below their decade high of 30.6X and at a 24% discount to the median of 9.2X.In comparison, United trades at $51 per share and 7.4X forward earnings, also beneath the industry average. This is well below its absurd decade-long high of 747.2X but slightly above its median of 8.8X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGuidance &amp; Outlook Delta stock ended the last trading session down over 3% despite an impressive quarterly report as the company’s first-quarter guidance forecasted EPS between $0.15 - $0.40 a share. This came in below many analysts’ expectations with the Zacks Consensus for Q1 at $0.45 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchYear over year, Delta’s earnings are now projected to climb 59% in FY23 at $5.10 per share, based on Zacks estimates. This is on par with Delta’s outlook of EPS between $5-$6 per share. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to rise another 29% to $6.57 per share with Delta believing they can achieve EPS of $7 a share. Earnings estimates are slightly up for both FY23 and FY24 over the last 90 days.Pivoting to United before its Q4 report, full-year fiscal 2022 earnings are now expected at $2.11 per share compared to an adjusted loss of -$13.94 a share in 2021. Fiscal 2023 earnings are expected to rebound another 228% at $6.92 per share. Earnings estimates revisions have largely gone up for both FY22 and FY23 over the last quarter.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line There could continue to be more upside left in these airline stocks, especially when looking at their current valuations. At the moment, United Airlines lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) in correlation with earnings estimate revisions trending much higher for FY23. As for Delta, the stock lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) with earnings estimates slightly higher for FY23 despite the company’s guidance for its first quarter EPS being below many analyst expectations.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest In. A holding company is a business entity, usually a corporation or limited liability company, that does not directly manufacture products, offer any services, or carry out any other business operations. Instead, holding companies own controlling stakes in other companies. The main purpose of a holding company is to offer centralized management, and they may also be used for tax or liability purposes. So while it may oversee a subsidiary’s management decisions, a holding company does not actively engage in the daily operations of these subsidiaries.While a holding company structure can be complicated to navigate, it offers multiple benefits including centralized management and control, limited liability, tax relief, flexibility in terms of investment opportunities and diversifying risk, and branding and reputation management. However, holding companies are subject to additional regulations, limited control over the day-to-day operations of their subsidiary companies, dependence on the performance of subsidiary companies, and problems in raising capital. Some of the best holding company stocks to invest in include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A).

MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest In.  Suggested articles:11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy15 Largest Orthopedic Companies in the World11 Undervalued Mid Cap Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest In is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. In this article, we decided to focus on Ross Stores'  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments. View our latest analysis for Ross Stores How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?ROE can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Ross Stores is:35% = US$1.4b ÷ US$4.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.35 in profit.Why Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Ross Stores' Earnings Growth And 35% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Ross Stores has a significantly high ROE. Even when compared to the industry average of 29% the company's ROE is pretty decent. However, while Ross Stores has a pretty respectable ROE, its five year net income decline rate was 2.8%. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesSo, as a next step, we compared Ross Stores' performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 34% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is ROST fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Ross Stores Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Looking at its three-year median payout ratio of 26% (or a retention ratio of 74%) which is pretty normal, Ross Stores' declining earnings is rather baffling as one would expect to see a fair bit of growth when a company is retaining a good portion of its profits. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds.In addition, Ross Stores has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 26%. Regardless, the future ROE for Ross Stores is predicted to rise to 52% despite there being not much change expected in its payout ratio.SummaryOverall, we feel that Ross Stores certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits. By the looks of it, there could be some other factors, not necessarily in control of the business, that's preventing growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

ROST is an attractive bet for the long term, owing to its strong fundamentals and the off-price retail business model that allows it to deliver value bargains to customers. It has been benefiting from the execution of its store expansion plans over the years. It provided an upbeat view for the fourth quarter and fiscal 2022.Ross Stores’ top and bottom lines beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in third-quarter fiscal 2022. This marked the second straight quarter of a bottom-line beat. In third-quarter fiscal 2022, the company’s shoes category remained the key growth driver, with Florida and Texas being the top-performing regions. Results also gained from lower incentive costs and eased domestic freight expenses. Overall, gains at the core business demonstrated consumers' continued focus on value and the company’s ability to deliver value bargains to customers.Backed by the robust fiscal third-quarter performance, the stock outperformed the industry and the Retail - Wholesale sector in the past three months. ROST has rallied 42.5% in the past three months compared with the industry and the sector’s growth of 12.1% and 8.4%, respectively. The stock also compares favorably with the S&amp;P 500’s rise of 7.8% in the same period.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company’s fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 sales and earnings suggests growth of 2.2% and 18.3%, respectively, from the year-ago period’s reported numbers. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research Factors Driving GrowthRoss Stores is likely to benefit from the improved traffic trends in the retail industry. The company’s third-quarter fiscal 2022 results reflected gains from improved traffic trends from the first half and better inventory position despite year-over-year declines in the top and bottom lines.As of the end of the fiscal third quarter, consolidated inventories increased 11.8% from the 2021 comparable period, reflecting a significant moderation from the first half of fiscal 2022. Average store inventory increased 4% in the quarter, down from the pre-pandemic levels.The company also continues to witness SG&amp;A leverage, which is aiding margins. Although Ross Stores was affected by the inflationary cost environment in third-quarter fiscal 2022, lower incentive costs acted as an upside. The decline in incentive costs resulted in lower SG&amp;A expenses in the quarter. Notably, SG&amp;A expenses declined 4.5% year over year. SG&amp;A, as a percentage of sales, contracted 70 bps year over year to 15.2%. Lower incentive costs more than offset the deleveraging effects of declining comps.Ross Stores has been consistent with the execution of its store expansion plans over the years. The company’s store expansion efforts are focused on continually increasing penetration in the existing, as well as new, markets. In third-quarter fiscal 2022, the company completed its store expansion target for fiscal 2022, with the opening of 28 Ross stores and 12 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. For fiscal 2022, ROST opened 91 stores, comprising 71 Ross stores and 28 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores. The company earlier anticipated closing 10 older stores in fiscal 2022.The company expects to end fiscal 2022 with 1,693 Ross stores and 322 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores, marking a net increase of 92 stores. As of Sep 30, 2022, Ross Stores operated 2,019 outlets, including 1,696 Ross stores across 40 states, the District of Columbia and Guam, and 323 dd’s DISCOUNTS stores in 21 states.Given the large retail closures and bankruptcies over the past several years, Ross Stores earlier raised its long-term store expansion targets. The company expects “Ross Dress for Less” to expand to 2,900 stores compared with the previously mentioned 2,400 stores.Additionally, it anticipates dd’s DISCOUNTS to expand to 700 stores versus the earlier stated 600 stores. This represents a 20% increase in potential store growth targets, bringing it to 3,600 stores. This indicates significant growth from the company’s store count of 1,923 stores at the end of fiscal 2021.Given the third-quarter sales momentum and improved assortments for the holiday season, Ross Stores raised its guidance for fourth-quarter fiscal 2022. The company expects comps to be flat to down 2% in the fiscal fourth quarter, whereas it reported 9% comps growth in the prior-year quarter. Earnings per share are envisioned to be $1.13-$1.26 for the fiscal fourth quarter. The company reported earnings of $1.04 per share in the year-ago quarter.The earnings view for the fiscal fourth quarter is based on sales of flat to up 3% and the operating margin of 9.7% to 10.5%. Notably, the company reported an operating margin of 9.8% in the year-ago quarter. The operating margin view indicates gains due to the easing of significant cost pressures from ocean freight and lower incentives in the prior-year quarter.For fiscal 2022, the company envisions earnings per share of $4.21-$4.34. Notably, it reported $4.87 in fiscal 2021.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are three other top-ranked stocks to consider — Build-A-Bear Workshop BBW, Capri Holdings CPRI and Tecnoglass TGLS.Build-A-Bear, a multi-channel retailer of plush animals and related products, currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

175,c8198623-9715-381d-850c-2b96836c3503,RF,2023-01-17,F.N.B. (FNB) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/f-n-b-fnb-reports-150003032.html,1673881203,STORY,"['RF-PC', 'FNB']","[F.N.B. (FNB) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended December 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on January 23, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis financial holding company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.41 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +36.7%.Revenues are expected to be $396.26 million, up 31.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.78% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for F.N.B.For F.N.B.The Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -4.05%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that F.N.B. Will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that F.N.B. Would post earnings of $0.36 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.39, delivering a surprise of +8.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.F.N.B. Doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Banks - Southeast industry, Regions Financial (RF) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.65 per share for the quarter ended December 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +47.7%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.94 billion, up 18.8% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Regions Financial has been revised 0.9% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.77%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Regions Financial will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Visa’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Visa Is Visa Still Cheap?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 8.48% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Visa today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $205.63, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. What's more, Visa’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.What kind of growth will Visa generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 44% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Visa. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? V’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company.

Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on V, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value.

These include petroleum products (26.9%), engineering goods (11.9%), gems and jewellery (15.2%), and drugs and pharmaceuticals (1.9%). On the other hand, imports of key items like gold, silver, electronic goods, and project goods also contracted.India’s exports to the US were highest at $59.6 billion in April-December 2022. Others that followed are the UAE, Netherlands, Bangladesh, and Singapore.India should aim to reduce its import billWith the likelihood of a global recession rising in 2023, Indian traders are likely to face more challenges. A part of the problem is that India imports more than it exports, inflating the country’s trade balance.Analysts believe its reliance on crude oil for 80% of its energy requirements must be reduced. “India must re-energize exploration of local oil fields and enhance production through coal mines. Any development will cut the energy import bill substantially and improve the current account,” The Economic Times reported in January, citing the economic think tank Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).Story continuesIndia is estimated to pay $270 billion for coal and crude imports in 2022, accounting for about 40% of its total merchandise bill, GTRI said.India’s commerce ministry is doing a “country-wise as well as commodity-wise” analysis to boost exports, the Financial Times reported today, quoting commerce secretary Sunil Bharthwal.

The company's shares saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at News’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for News What Is News Worth?Good news, investors! News is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $29.64, but it is currently trading at US$19.46 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. However, given that News’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will News generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 35% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for News. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since NWSA is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. With a positive outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on NWSA for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy NWSA.

The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at NVIDIA’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA What Is NVIDIA Worth?NVIDIA appears to be expensive according to my price multiple model, which makes a comparison between the company's price-to-earnings ratio and the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that NVIDIA’s ratio of 69.81x is above its peer average of 18.15x, which suggests the stock is trading at a higher price compared to the Semiconductor industry. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that NVIDIA’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from NVIDIA?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 61% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for NVIDIA. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in NVDA’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe NVDA should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NVDA for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for NVDA, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

As enterprises across the world rapidly migrate to the cloud environment, the company has been witnessing a rising demand for its software-as-a-service (SaaS), infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service products.In the fiscal second quarter, management noted that the company’s IaaS and SaaS business grew 22% to $2.7 billion.Per a Gartner report, 45% of the global organizations will have experienced attacks on their supply chains by 2025, almost three times more than in 2021. As more organizations across industries, from retail to financial services, shift most of their critical workloads to the cloud, security breaches and data exposures are increasing. The introduction of hybrid work and digital business processes in the cloud brought in newer risks.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has also been riding on the robust demand for its infrastructure cloud services. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Companies like MercadoLibre, Xactly, 8x8 and Zoom Video Communications selected Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services to address business needs, which is a testament to the strength of its cloud offerings. The cloud services offering opened up a new source of recurring revenues (subscriptions) which is expected to improve visibility.In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Oracle and NVIDIA NVDA announced a multi-year partnership to help customers solve business challenges with accelerated computing and artificial intelligence. The collaboration aims to bring the full NVIDIA accelerated computing stack — from GPUs to systems to software — to OCI. OCI is adding tens of thousands more NVIDIA GPUs, including the A100 and upcoming H100 to its capacity.With Oracle's alliance with NVIDIA, OCI provides GPU-accelerated compute services to support SymphonyAI's customers' ability to train AI models rapidly to forecast purchasing trends, making sure every customer's store has the optimized number of products in the right place on the shelves.The higher availability of Oracle cloud regions globally is expected to fortify its competitive position in the cloud computing domain. Last month, Oracle opened its fourth cloud region in the United States for private and public sector partners and customers, the database products and cloud vendor said Thursday. This is the company’s 41st cloud region worldwide and joins an already existing cloud region for government organizations.Despite its late entry, Oracle has been endeavoring to grab a larger share of the prospective cloud market, which is dominated by the likes of Amazon’s AMZN Amazon Web Services, Microsoft’s MSFT Azure Cloud and Google Cloud.According to estimates from Synergy Research Group, Amazon’s market share in the worldwide cloud infrastructure market amounted to 34% in the third quarter of 2022, still exceeding the combined market share of its two largest competitors, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud which stood at 21% and 11%, respectively.In third-quarter 2022, global cloud infrastructure service spending climbed to $57 billion, bringing the industry total for the trailing 12 months to $217 billion.

(NYSE: TRV) today announced preliminary results for the fourth quarter of 2022.For the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company expects to report net income of $819 million, or $3.44 per diluted share, and core income of $810 million, or $3.40 per diluted share.Fourth quarter 2022 results include the Company’s estimate for catastrophe losses of $459 million pre-tax ($362 million after-tax), net of reinsurance. Catastrophe losses primarily resulted from the significant winter storm that impacted much of the U.S and Canada in late December.""We are pleased with the solid results for the quarter in light of the late December winter storm,"" said Alan Schnitzer, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""While the footprint of the storm was substantial, impacting 37 U.S. states, the District of Columbia and Canada, our loss experience is consistent with our modeled estimates.""Aside from the catastrophic weather, underlying results in our commercial businesses were exceptional. Underlying results in Personal Insurance remain challenged by elevated industrywide loss costs. We recorded another quarter of progress with strong pricing and other actions to address these challenges. Across all three segments, we are also pleased with continued strong net written premium growth in the quarter, positioning us well as we enter the new year.""The Company also expects results in the fourth quarter of 2022 to include an underlying underwriting gain of $723 million pre-tax ($571 million after-tax), net investment income of $625 million pre-tax ($531 million after-tax), which includes $601 million pre-tax ($510 million after-tax) from the fixed income portfolio, and net favorable prior year reserve development of $185 million pre-tax ($145 million after-tax).Conference CallAs previously announced, Travelers will review its fourth quarter and full year 2022 results at 9 a.m. ET on Tuesday, January 24, following the release of results earlier that morning.

In some cases, these measures are considered non-GAAP financial measures under applicable SEC rules because they are not displayed as separate line items in the consolidated financial statements or are not required to be disclosed in the notes to financial statements or, in some cases, include or exclude certain items not ordinarily included or excluded in the most comparable GAAP financial measure. Reconciliations of these measures to the most comparable GAAP measures also follow.In the opinion of the Company’s management, a discussion of these measures provides investors, financial analysts, rating agencies and other financial statement users with a better understanding of the significant factors that comprise the Company’s periodic results of operations and how management evaluates the Company’s financial performance.Some of these measures exclude net realized investment gains (losses), net of tax, and/or net unrealized investment gains (losses), net of tax, included in shareholders’ equity, which can be significantly impacted by both discretionary and other economic factors and are not necessarily indicative of operating trends.Other companies may calculate these measures differently, and, therefore, their measures may not be comparable to those used by the Company’s management.Core income (loss) is consolidated net income (loss) excluding the after-tax impact of net realized investment gains (losses), discontinued operations, the effect of a change in tax laws and tax rates at enactment, and cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles when applicable. Financial statement users also consider core income (loss) when analyzing the results and trends of insurance companies. Core income (loss) per share is core income (loss) on a per common share basis.Reconciliation of Net Income to Core IncomeThree Months Ended($ in millions, after-tax)December 31, 2022Net income$819Adjustments:Net realized investment gains(9)Core income$810Reconciliation of Net Income per Share to Core Income per Share on a Basic and Diluted BasisThree Months EndedBasic income per shareDecember 31, 2022Net income$3.49Adjustments:Net realized investment gains(0.04)Core income$3.45Diluted income per shareNet income$3.44Adjustments:Net realized investment gains(0.04)Core income$3.40RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME TO UNDERWRITING GAIN EXCLUDING CERTAIN ITEMSUnderwriting gain (loss) is net earned premiums and fee income less claims and claim adjustment expenses and insurance-related expenses. In the opinion of the Company’s management, it is important to measure the profitability of each segment excluding the results of investing activities, which are managed separately from the insurance business. This measure is used to assess each segment’s business performance and as a tool in making business decisions. Underwriting gain, excluding the impact of catastrophes and net favorable (unfavorable) prior year loss reserve development, is the underwriting gain adjusted to exclude claims and claim adjustment expenses, reinstatement premiums and assessments related to catastrophes and loss reserve development related to time periods prior to the current year. In the opinion of the Company’s management, this measure is meaningful to users of the financial statements to understand the Company’s periodic earnings and the variability of earnings caused by the unpredictable nature (i.e., the timing and amount) of catastrophes and loss reserve development. This measure is also referred to as underlying underwriting gain, underlying underwriting margin, underlying underwriting income or underlying underwriting result.A catastrophe is a severe loss designated a catastrophe by internationally recognized organizations that track and report on insured losses resulting from catastrophic events, such as Property Claim Services (PCS) for events in the United States and Canada. Catastrophes can be caused by various natural events, including, among others, hurricanes, tornadoes and other windstorms, earthquakes, hail, wildfires, severe winter weather, floods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions and other naturally-occurring events, such as solar flares. Catastrophes can also be man-made, such as terrorist attacks and other intentionally destructive acts including those involving nuclear, biological, chemical and radiological events, cyber events, explosions and destruction of infrastructure. Each catastrophe has unique characteristics and catastrophes are not predictable as to timing or amount. Their effects are included in net and core income and claims and claim adjustment expense reserves upon occurrence. A catastrophe may result in the payment of reinsurance reinstatement premiums and assessments from various pools.The Company’s threshold for disclosing catastrophes is primarily determined at the reportable segment level. If a threshold for one segment or a combination thereof is exceeded and the other segments have losses from the same event, losses from the event are identified as catastrophe losses in the segment results and for the consolidated results of the Company. Additionally, an aggregate threshold is applied for international business across all reportable segments. The threshold for 2022 ranges from $20 million to $30 million of losses before reinsurance and taxes.Net favorable (unfavorable) prior year loss reserve development is the increase or decrease in incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses as a result of the re-estimation of claims and claim adjustment expense reserves at successive valuation dates for a given group of claims, which may be related to one or more prior years. In the opinion of the Company’s management, a discussion of loss reserve development is meaningful to users of the financial statements as it allows them to assess the impact between prior and current year development on incurred claims and claim adjustment expenses, net and core income (loss), and changes in claims and claim adjustment expense reserve levels from period to period.Reconciliation of Net Income to Pre-Tax Underlying Underwriting Income (also known as Underlying Underwriting Gain)Three Months Ended($ in millions, after-tax, except as noted)December 31, 2022Net income$819Net realized investment gains(9)Core income810Net investment income(531)Other (income) expense, including interest expense75Underwriting income354Income tax expense on underwriting results95Pre-tax underwriting income449Pre-tax impact of net favorable prior year reserve development(185)Pre-tax impact of catastrophes459Pre-tax underlying underwriting income$723Reconciliation of Net Income to After-Tax Underlying Underwriting Income (also known as Underlying Underwriting Gain)Three Months Ended($ in millions, after-tax)December 31, 2022Net income$819Net realized investment gains(9)Core income810Net investment income(531)Other (income) expense, including interest expense75Underwriting income354Impact of net favorable prior year reserve development(145)Impact of catastrophes362Underlying underwriting income$571View source version on businesswire.com: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230116005396/en/ContactsMedia:Patrick Linehan917.778.6267Institutional Investors:Abbe Goldstein917.778.6825]"

However, the season will gather pace this week. This reporting cycle will be important as market participants will closely monitor any sign of earnings, revenues or margin decline.A large section of economists and financial experts are concerned that the U.S. economy may face at least a mild recession in 2023 with a higher interest rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed.Nevertheless, five insurers are likely to beat Q4 2022 earnings results. These are - Aflac Inc. AFL, Reinsurance Group of America Inc. RGA, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc. MMC, Unum Group UNM and The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV.Insurance Sector Q4 2022An improving interest rate environment benefits life insurers as their products and investments are rate sensitive. A favorable interest rate thus impacts life insurers' earnings, capital and reserves, liquidity, and competitiveness positively.Insurance brokerage firms are continuously expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products. The rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance.To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. Insurers are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate.Accelerated digitization is also curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. It will also help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and retention rate. While investments in technology increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, insurers must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Story continuesOur Top PicksFive insurance companies are set to beat on fourth quarter earnings results.

201,c2a00d07-e6ed-3aeb-8b05-a5e78c217a08,DIS,2023-01-17,Brokers Suggest Investing in Disney (DIS): Read This Before Placing a Bet,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brokers-suggest-investing-disney-dis-143002868.html,1673879402,STORY,['DIS'],"[Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?Before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Walt Disney (DIS).Disney currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.40, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 21 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.40 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 21 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 71.4% and 14.3% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for DISBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for DISCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Disney here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Disney, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.In contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Should You Invest in DIS?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Disney, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 0.7% over the past month to $4.04.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Disney. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Disney with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Here is your full weekly roundup, all first covered on InvestingPro. Sign up for rapid-fire, comprehensive coverage of market-moving company news.Disney vs. PeltzWalt Disney (NYSE:DIS) on Wednesday afternoon said it opposed efforts by activist investor Nelson Peltz, of Trian Fund Management, to join the company’s board - setting the stage for a proxy battle - and simultaneously announced it had elected seven-year board veteran Mark Parker as Disney's chairman.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this entertainment company have returned +10.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's no change. The Zacks Media Conglomerates industry, to which Disney belongs, has gained 4.6% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Disney is expected to post earnings of $0.75 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -29.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.4%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.04 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +14.5%. This estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.35 indicates a change of +32.4% from what Disney is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Disney is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DIS _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Disney, the consensus sales estimate of $23.28 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +6.7%. The $90.79 billion and $96.65 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +9.8% and +6.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDisney reported revenues of $20.15 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.7%. EPS of $0.30 for the same period compares with $0.37 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.1 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -4.5%. The EPS surprise was -40%.Over the last four quarters, Disney surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Disney is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Disney. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest In. A holding company is a business entity, usually a corporation or limited liability company, that does not directly manufacture products, offer any services, or carry out any other business operations. Instead, holding companies own controlling stakes in other companies. The main purpose of a holding company is to offer centralized management, and they may also be used for tax or liability purposes. So while it may oversee a subsidiary’s management decisions, a holding company does not actively engage in the daily operations of these subsidiaries.While a holding company structure can be complicated to navigate, it offers multiple benefits including centralized management and control, limited liability, tax relief, flexibility in terms of investment opportunities and diversifying risk, and branding and reputation management. However, holding companies are subject to additional regulations, limited control over the day-to-day operations of their subsidiary companies, dependence on the performance of subsidiary companies, and problems in raising capital. Some of the best holding company stocks to invest in include JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC), and Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A). Investors can also take a look at the biggest holding companies in the world for a well-rounded stock portfolio.

MS is a leading investment bank and wealth management firm with approximately $5 trillion of client assets under management. It merged Citigroup’s Smith Barney business into its own wealth management business after the 2008 recession/financial crisis, which resulted in a more stable business model. Recent acquisitions of asset manager Eaton Vance and E-Trade provide additional stability and higher returns on capital. We believe MS has a sustainable competitive advantage due to its size and scale, global reach, strong reputation, and financial distribution capabilities. Importantly for a financial institution, it is in good financial health as key leverage ratios including common equity Tier 1 ratio, Tier 1 capital ratio, Tier 1 leverage ratio, and supplementary leverage ratio were all well above required minimums at the end of 2021.Our thesis on MS is that its wealth management business will continue to become a larger part of the overall company, which will increase overall margins and return on equity (ROE). Wealth management and asset management are less cyclical than investment banking, and often generate higher margins and provide better stability of financial results. For example, the addition of Smith Barney added significant scale and boosted wealth management operating margins from below 10% into the mid-20%s over the past several years while also increasing returns on equity. Looking ahead, we believe the company will benefit from rising asset prices and higher interest rates, should they happen over time…” (Click here to see the full text) Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest In.  Suggested articles:11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy15 Largest Orthopedic Companies in the World11 Undervalued Mid Cap Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 12 Best Holding Company Stocks To Invest In is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The Beaumont refinery processes nearly 369,000 barrels per day of crude oil and manufactures 2.8 billion gallons of gasoline per year.The commencement of a 250,000-bpd crude distillation unit (“CDU”) at the refinery is expected this month, making Beaumont the second-largest refinery in the United States. The CDU will increase the refinery’s capacity by 68%.CDUs initially convert crude into feedstocks for other units at the refinery. The equipment will not generate big new volumes of gasoline and diesel instantly. The company plans to advance the new CDU slowly to cope with potential startup problems.The refinery expansion is taking place when U.S. President Joe Biden has been urging refiners to produce more fuels or face penalties. The expansion will likely create 120,000 bpd of refined products, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, and supply feedstocks for its other Gulf Coast refineries.ExxonMobil did not provide information about the initiation of the Beaumont Light Atmospheric Distillation Expansion (“BLADE”) project, a new processing facility. The company’s crude oil extracted from the Permian shale play in West Texas and New Mexico was planned to be processed by BLADE.According to a U.S. Energy Information Administration report, six crude oil refineries in the United States have shut down, dropping the U.S. capacity from 18.98 million bpd to 17.9 million bpd since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.ExxonMobil’s Beaumont refinery expansion marks a return to the time of steady refining capacity gains through processing modifications and adding new equipment to existing facilities.

As stated recently by CNBC, the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey on Jan 13 showed that the one-year inflation outlook was down to 4%, which reflects the lowest level since April 2021.This might excite an investor to bet on stocks that are already showing signs of growth. However, a prudent investor knows that only a growth exhibiting character is not sufficient while choosing a stock. If one wants to avoid huge losses in times of crisis, one needs to look for relatively safe bets. To this end, we recommend stocks like Oxford Industries OXM, Ingredion INGR, Novo Nordisk NVO, Helmerich &amp; Payne HP and Fox Factory Holdings FOXF, which bear low leverage and therefore can shield investors from incurring losses in times of crisis.Now, before selecting low-leverage stocks, let’s explore what leverage is and how choosing a low-leverage stock helps investors.In finance, leverage is a term used to denote the practice of borrowing capital by companies to run their operations smoothly and expand the same. Such borrowings are done through debt financing. But there remains an option for equity finance. This is probably due to the cheap and easy availability of debt over equity financing.However, debt financing has its share of drawbacks. Particularly, it is desirable only as long as it successfully generates a higher rate of return compared to the interest rate. So, to avoid considerable losses in your portfolio, one should always avoid companies that resort to exorbitant debt financing.Therefore, the crux of safe investment lies in choosing a company that is not burdened with debt, as a debt-free stock is almost impossible to find.Such an event shows how volatile the equity market can be at times and as an investor if you don’t want to lose big time, we suggest you invest in stocks, which bear low leverage and are hence less risky.Story continuesTo identify such stocks, historically several leverage ratios have been developed to measure the amount of debt a company bears and the debt-to-equity ratio is one of the most common ratios.Analyzing Debt/EquityDebt-to-Equity Ratio = Total Liabilities/Shareholders’ EquityThis metric is a liquidity ratio that indicates the amount of financial risk a company bears. A lower debt-to-equity ratio reflects improved solvency for a company.With the fourth-quarter earnings cycle knocking at the doors, investors must be eyeing stocks that have exhibited solid earnings growth in the recent past. But if a stock bears a high debt-to-equity ratio in times of economic downturn, its so-called booming earnings picture might turn into a nightmare.The Winning StrategyConsidering the aforementioned factors, it is prudent to choose stocks with a low debt-to-equity ratio to ensure steady returns.Yet, an investment strategy based solely on the debt-to-equity ratio might not fetch the desired outcome. To choose stocks that have the potential to give you steady returns, we have expanded our screening criteria to include some other factors.Here are the other parameters:Debt/Equity less than X-Industry Median: Stocks that are less leveraged than their industry peers.Current Price greater than or equal to 10: The stocks must be trading at a minimum of $10 or above.Average 20-day Volume greater than or equal to 50000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.Percentage Change in EPS F(0)/F(-1) greater than X-Industry Median: Earnings growth adds to optimism, leading to a stock’s price appreciation.VGM Score of A or B: Our research shows that stocks with a VGM Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), offer the best upside potential.Estimated One-Year EPS Growth F(1)/F(0) greater than 5: This shows earnings growth expectation.Zacks Rank #1 or 2: Irrespective of market conditions, stocks with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 have a proven history of success.Excluding stocks that have a negative or a zero debt-to-equity ratio, here we present our five picks that made it through the screen.Oxford Industries: It is an apparel company, which designs, sources, markets and distributes products bearing the trademarks of its owned and licensed brands.

Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. For example, the F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) share price is down 34% in the last year. That contrasts poorly with the market decline of 15%. On the other hand, the stock is actually up 8.5% over three years.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. See our latest analysis for F5 To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Unhappily, F5 had to report a 2.0% decline in EPS over the last year. This reduction in EPS is not as bad as the 34% share price fall. Unsurprisingly, given the lack of EPS growth, the market seems to be more cautious about the stock.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthIt might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on F5's earnings, revenue and cash flow.A Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 15% in the twelve months, F5 shareholders did even worse, losing 34%. However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 0.6% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with F5 .Story continuesOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned +5.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's no change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, to which Devon Energy belongs, has gained 1% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.99 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +43.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $8.55 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +142.2%. This estimate has changed -5.2% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.37 indicates a change of -2.1% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -5.2%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Devon Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $4.83 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13%. The $19.91 billion and $19.4 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +67.1% and -2.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $5.43 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.7%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.08 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.91 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +10.58%. The EPS surprise was +2.35%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

To address these challenges, Oracle today announced a series of new cloud capabilities. Price Hub extends Oracle Retail Merchandising Cloud Services to automate the pricing process so retailers can easily make purchase price updates across thousands of products to maximize sales and margins. And new promotion capabilities in Oracle Retail Customer Engagement Cloud Services help retailers drive incremental revenue and profitability by executing more personalized and compelling offers. The cloud services are running on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)""Consumers are bombarded with a barrage of offers and messages every day, and well-executed promotions and great prices are what most often get them to pay attention and take action,"" said Mike Webster, senior vice president and general manager of Oracle Retail. ""By extending our comprehensive platform for modern retail we are eliminating the hassle in executing effective pricing and promotion programs, while helping retailers support their broader financial, merchandising, and customer engagement goals.""The price is rightIn a recent survey* of more than 8,000 global consumers, 47% noted that price is the leading factor in getting them to make a purchase. As such, retailers need the flexibility to quickly adjust prices based on market forces and consumer demand. However, with thousands of products distributed across multiple geographies, manually managing pricing changes is often laborious and inaccurate. Price Hub automates price movements and calculates the best price based on the retailer's specific pricing strategy. Price Hub modules include:Story continuesPrice Strategies allows retailers to automate price changes based on their configured strategies using pre-defined fields such as cost, margin, area differential, or competitor. They can also build in their own unique fields as required.Price Modeling enables retailers to model prices based on cost, margin, or a 'what-if' analysis prior to making pricing updates to mitigate risk.Event Planning helps retailers create and manage a significant number of promotions and/or clearances. This includes supporting collaboration between teams in developing promotions and managing budget data and marketing materials.Promotions that pay offSecond to price, the survey* showed that a special offer is what most often moves a consumer (39%) from a browser to a buyer. And 30% added that compelling offers are what attracts them to buy from new brands. Yet clearly defining and fulfilling these offers across channels is often a time-consuming headache for retailers. New extensions to Oracle Retail Customer Engagement Cloud Services eliminates these challenges to help retailers drive incremental revenue and profitability by more executing relevant offers. New modules include:Oracle Retail Promotion Engine Cloud Service is a highly scalable promotion management solution. Its calculation engine has built-in APIs that make it easy to integrate with a retailers' existing transaction systems such as Point of Sale (POS), ecommerce, order management, and other shopping apps. It provides a unique 'single point of definition' for each promotion so retailers can publish a wide variety of offers at the same time without system confusion. This helps ensure that consumers receive a consistent purchase experience regardless of channel.Campaign and Deal Management Cloud Service can seamlessly publish offers into the Oracle Retail Promotion Engine to extend promotion capabilities to include single and multi-use coupons. Built-in performance scorecards provide key performance metrics on how each promotion is performing.Oracle Retail Customer Management and Segmentation Foundation Cloud Service securely stores customer data so that retailers can define and focus on high potential customer segments that can increase loyalty, average spend, and repeat purchases. The campaign and deal management module uses this information to get the right offers to the right customers at the right time to improve satisfaction and marketing ROI.See these solutions and Oracle's complete platform for modern retail in action at the National Retail Federation (NRF) show on January 15 – 17, 2023 in New York at booth #5121 or virtually by visiting https://www.oracle.com/industries/retail/zoom-zone/*The survey polled 8,107 global consumers across 11 different countries in late September 2022.

As enterprises across the world rapidly migrate to the cloud environment, the company has been witnessing a rising demand for its software-as-a-service (SaaS), infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) and platform-as-a-service products.In the fiscal second quarter, management noted that the company’s IaaS and SaaS business grew 22% to $2.7 billion.Per a Gartner report, 45% of the global organizations will have experienced attacks on their supply chains by 2025, almost three times more than in 2021. As more organizations across industries, from retail to financial services, shift most of their critical workloads to the cloud, security breaches and data exposures are increasing. The introduction of hybrid work and digital business processes in the cloud brought in newer risks.The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has also been riding on the robust demand for its infrastructure cloud services. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Companies like MercadoLibre, Xactly, 8x8 and Zoom Video Communications selected Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services to address business needs, which is a testament to the strength of its cloud offerings. The cloud services offering opened up a new source of recurring revenues (subscriptions) which is expected to improve visibility.In the second quarter of fiscal 2023, Oracle and NVIDIA NVDA announced a multi-year partnership to help customers solve business challenges with accelerated computing and artificial intelligence. The collaboration aims to bring the full NVIDIA accelerated computing stack — from GPUs to systems to software — to OCI. OCI is adding tens of thousands more NVIDIA GPUs, including the A100 and upcoming H100 to its capacity.With Oracle's alliance with NVIDIA, OCI provides GPU-accelerated compute services to support SymphonyAI's customers' ability to train AI models rapidly to forecast purchasing trends, making sure every customer's store has the optimized number of products in the right place on the shelves.The higher availability of Oracle cloud regions globally is expected to fortify its competitive position in the cloud computing domain. Last month, Oracle opened its fourth cloud region in the United States for private and public sector partners and customers, the database products and cloud vendor said Thursday. This is the company’s 41st cloud region worldwide and joins an already existing cloud region for government organizations.Despite its late entry, Oracle has been endeavoring to grab a larger share of the prospective cloud market, which is dominated by the likes of Amazon’s AMZN Amazon Web Services, Microsoft’s MSFT Azure Cloud and Google Cloud.According to estimates from Synergy Research Group, Amazon’s market share in the worldwide cloud infrastructure market amounted to 34% in the third quarter of 2022, still exceeding the combined market share of its two largest competitors, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud which stood at 21% and 11%, respectively.In third-quarter 2022, global cloud infrastructure service spending climbed to $57 billion, bringing the industry total for the trailing 12 months to $217 billion. Amazon, Microsoft and Google accounted for two thirds of cloud infrastructure revenues in the three months ended Sep 30 with the eight largest providers controlling more than 80% of the market.Story continuesWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They are well-established in nature, have more analyst coverage, and frequently pay dividends, which are undeniably significant benefits that make them so popular among investors.While many of these companies are no longer experiencing supercharged growth, several currently top-ranked large-caps are exceptions, including The Kroger Co. KR, The Hershey Company HSY, and Aon PLC AON.Below is a chart illustrating the performance of all three stocks over the last year, with the S&amp;P 500 blended in as a benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFor those with a preference for large-caps, let’s take a closer look at each one.The Kroger Co. Founded in 1883, the long-time retailer operates approximately 2,700 retail stores under its various banners and divisions in 35 states. KR sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).The company is expected to grow its bottom line despite a tricky business environment; estimates for its current fiscal year (FY23) suggest Y/Y earnings growth of more than 12%.And in FY24, the company’s bottom line is indicated to expand a further marginal 1.5%. KR carries a Style Score of “A” for Growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchIn addition, Kroger has shown a commitment to increasingly rewarding its shareholders, carrying a 15% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.KR’s annual dividend currently yields 2.3%, nicely above its Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Hershey CompanyThe Hershey Company is the largest chocolate manufacturer in North America and a global leader in chocolate and non-chocolate confectionery. HSY has recently seen its earnings outlook drift higher, helping push the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).It’s hard to ignore HSY’s quarterly performance; the company has exceeded both top and bottom line estimates in nine consecutive quarters.In its latest release, Hershey reported EPS nearly 5% above expectations and posted a 4% revenue surprise.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEstimates for Hershey’s current fiscal year (FY22) suggest Y/Y earnings growth of 16% and a 15% revenue increase.And in FY23, the company’s earnings and revenue are forecasted to climb 8% and 6.5%, respectively. HSY sports a Style Score of “B” for Growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAon PLCAon is a multinational corporation offering risk management services, insurance and reinsurance brokerage, human resource consulting, and outsourcing services worldwide.Aon has seen its earnings outlook improve across all timeframes, pushing the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAon has generated solid cash as of late; in its latest quarter, the company generated nearly $1 billion in free cash flow, good enough for a 60% sequential uptick.As we can see in the chart below, the company’s free cash flow has recovered nicely from 2021 lows.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAnd for the cherry on top, the company is expected to grow at a solid pace; for its current fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate of $13.16 suggests Y/Y earnings growth of nearly 10%.Pivoting to next year, estimates suggest a further 11% of earnings growth.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineLarge-cap stocks are found in every portfolio, and for understandable reasons – they’re highly liquid, carry strong brand recognition, boast top-tier management, and carry a strong level of stability.While these companies generally don’t enjoy breakneck growth anymore, all three stocks above – The Kroger Co. KR, The Hershey Company HSY, and Aon PLC AON – have bright growth outlooks, all expected to grow their earnings by at least 9% in their current fiscal years.Further, all three have witnessed positive earnings estimate revisions as of late, indicating that their near-term business outlooks are fruitful.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

219,7b9a11c4-6bf8-3414-ae96-6774250742e7,PLD,2023-01-17,Key Factors to Impact Prologis (PLD) This Earnings Season,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/key-factors-impact-prologis-pld-145502236.html,1673880902,STORY,['PLD'],"[Prologis, Inc. PLD is slated to report fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Jan 18 before the bell. The company’s quarterly results are likely to reflect growth in revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share.Over the trailing four quarters, Prologis beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate in terms of FFO per share on three occasions and missed the same on the other, the average beat being 1.36%. This is depicted in the graph below:Prologis, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePrologis, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePrologis, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Prologis, Inc. QuoteLet’s see how things have shaped up before this announcement.Factors at PlayDespite the recent slowdown in demand, 2022 appeared a solid year for the U.S. industrial market, per the Cushman &amp; Wakefield CWK report.There was a net absorption of 107.3 million square feet (msf) of space in the December-end quarter, down 9.4% from the third quarter. This stemmed from slowing demand amid economic headwinds and historically tight market conditions. However, it marked the ninth straight quarter where absorption surpassed the 100 msf mark.Moreover, for the third year in succession, the U.S. industrial market inked more than 700 msf of new leasing volume, with 757 msf signed throughout 2022. Although the U.S. industrial vacancy rate moved up 20 basis points (bps) from the prior quarter to 3.3%, vacancy is still 140 bps lower than what it was pre-pandemic and remains more than 300 bps lower than its 10-year average of 6.5%.Though asking rents increased in 2022, these exhibited signs of moderation in recent quarters. While the average industrial asking rental rate climbed just 1.0% sequentially to $8.81 per square foot, it surged 18.6% year over year. This marked the strongest year inhistory for annual rental rate growth, per the CWK report.PLD is well-poised to benefit from this favorable trend, given its capacity to offer modern logistics facilities at strategic in-fill locations. Moreover, with global supply chains transforming for faster fulfillment and resilience, Prologis is likely to have captured favorable fundamentals with its differentiated customer offerings and solid investment activity in the to-be-reported quarter.Prologis’ expansion efforts through acquisitions and developments in recent years are likely to have boosted the top line in the to-be-reported quarter. In addition, PLD is likely to have gained from its industry-leading cost structure.Story continuesMoreover, Prologis has decent balance sheet strength to fuel its growth endeavors. A market leader, this industrial REIT has the ability to raise capital at favorable rates. It is likely to have maintained financial strength with liquidity during the period in discussion.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter revenues is currently pegged at $1.41 billion, suggesting a 31.5% year-over-year jump. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO per share of $1.21 calls for an 8.04% increase year over year.However, with the asset category being attractive, there is a development boom in many markets. Per the CWK report, in the fourth quarter, new deliveries remained elevated, with 143.6 msf of industrial product completing construction. Consequently, supply outpaced demand for the second straight quarter and on an annual basis. The high supply is likely to have intensified competition during the December-end quarter.For the full-year 2022, Prologis expected core FFO per share in the range of $5.12-$5.14. The company expects average occupancy in the band of 97.25-97.75% and cash same-store NOI (Prologis share) at 8.50-8.75%.For the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for FFO per share has risen a cent to $5.13 over the past month. The figure indicates a 23.6% increase year over year on revenues of $4.76 billion.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model predicts a surprise in terms of FFO per share for Prologis this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is the case here.Prologis currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of +0.55%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other stocks from the REIT sector — Host Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc. HST, STAG Industrial, Inc. STAG and SL Green Realty Corp. SLG — you may want to consider as our model shows that these also have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.Host Hotels &amp; Resorts is slated to report quarterly numbers on Feb 15. HST has an Earnings ESP of +1.75% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3 presently. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.STAG Industrial, scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Feb 15, has an Earnings ESP of +2.89% and carries a Zacks Rank of 2.SL Green Realty, slated to release quarterly numbers on Jan 25, has an Earnings ESP of +2.03% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3 at present.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Expedia’s web portals focus on travel planning, travel purchases, and travel experience sharing.TripAdvisor’s platform is also for users to share reviews and opinions on hotels, destinations, attractions, and restaurants. In addition to this, TripAdvisor also facilitates bookings between hotel operators and consumers.TripAdvisor’s top-line growth is starting to stick out. TripAdvisor’s current fiscal 2022 sales are now expected to pop 64% and climb another 17% in FY23 to $1.73 billion. More importantly, fiscal 2023 would represent 10% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $1.56 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLooking at Expedia, sales are forecasted to jump 37% for its current fiscal 2022 and rise another 9% in FY23 at $12.87 billion. With 2019 sales at $12 billion, fiscal 2023 would be a 7% increase from pre-pandemic levels.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEarnings EstimatesOn the bottom line, Expedia’s earnings are very intriguing and expected to now rebound 352% for FY22 at $7.46 a share compared to EPS of $1.65 per share in 2021. Even better, fiscal 2023 earnings are projected to climb another 20%. Plus, earnings estimate revisions have noticeably increased  for FY22 and FY23.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPivoting to TripAdvisor, earnings are now expected to be $0.61 a share for FY22 compared to an adjusted loss of -$0.30 per share in 2021. Fiscal 2023 earnings are forecasted to rebound another 120% at $1.34 per share. Earnings estimates have gone down for FY22 and have slightly declined for FY23 as well.Story continuesPerformance &amp; Recent Momentum Over the last year, TripAdvisor is down -26% Vs. Expedia’s -42% with both underperforming the S&amp;P 500’s -16%. Looking at the last decade, Expedia’s +70% has largely outperformed TripAdvisor’s -51% but still trailed the benchmark.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlthough Expedia and TripAdvisor’s historical performances have lagged the broader market, analysts have remained very optimistic about online travel companies due to pent-up demand and a resilient consumer.This has recently led to continued rallies in Expedia and TripAdvisor stock with both up roughly +24% in the last month to impressively top the rally in broader indexes to start the new year.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchValuation After the recent spike in Expedia and TripAdvisor stock, they still trade reasonably relative to their past which could support more upside ahead. Shares of Expedia especially stand out trading at $106 per share and 15.3X forward earnings. In comparison, TripAdvisor trades around $21 per share and 32.6X forward earnings.Expedia trades nicely below the industry average of 24.4X and beneath the S&amp;P 500’s 17.9X. This is also 76% below its decade high of 63.5X and a 40% discount to the median of 25.5X. In its own right, TripAdvisor stock trades much more reasonably to its extreme decade-long high of 3,600X and at a 33% discount to the median of 48.9X.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LineExpedia stock appears to have the edge over its online travel peer and currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) in correlation with rising earnings estimate revisions, along with its standout valuation among the industry.However, TripAdvisor’s top-line growth is very impressive and the company appears to be a sound investment as well with earnings stabilizing despite estimates trending down over the last quarter. This lands TripAdvisor a Zack Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

224,db49df7e-ea0f-3b5f-b686-064944b2394a,RMD,2023-01-17,ResMed's (NYSE:RMD) 21% CAGR outpaced the company's earnings growth over the same five-year period,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/resmeds-nyse-rmd-21-cagr-132906196.html,1673875746,STORY,['RMD'],"[The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on a lighter note, a good company can see its share price rise well over 100%. Long term ResMed Inc. (NYSE:RMD) shareholders would be well aware of this, since the stock is up 149% in five years. And in the last week the share price has popped 4.0%. But this could be related to the buoyant market which is up about 3.3% in a week.After a strong gain in the past week, it's worth seeing if longer term returns have been driven by improving fundamentals. Check out our latest analysis for ResMed While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, ResMed managed to grow its earnings per share at 17% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 20% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that ResMed has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of ResMed, it has a TSR of 162% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's certainly disappointing to see that ResMed shares lost 13% throughout the year, that wasn't as bad as the market loss of 15%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 21%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

227,553c2db0-99b0-35d5-8fdd-538d95802e2b,MDLZ,2023-01-17,The J.M. Smucker (SJM) Up More Than 15% in 6 Months: Here's Why,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/j-m-smucker-sjm-more-133901341.html,1673876341,STORY,"['SJM', 'MDLZ', 'LW']","[The J. M. Smucker Company SJM is well-positioned courtesy of strategic pricing actions. Strength in the company’s Away from Home division and Coffee business is yielding. The iconic food and beverages’ company is progressing well with core priorities.The upsides mentioned above boosted its second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with sales rising year over year and beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Impressively, management raised its fiscal 2023 net sales and earnings view.This Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock has rallied 18.3% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 8.9% growth. The stock has outperformed the Zacks Consumer Staples sector, rising 4.7% in the period.Let’s delve deeper.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSolid Q2 Results &amp; Raised ViewIn the second quarter of fiscal 2023, The J. M. Smucker’s net sales amounted to $2,205 million, which advanced 8% on the back of Pet and Coffee businesses and solid growth for the Uncrustables brand. Excluding non-comparable net sales related to divestitures and currency movements, net sales increased 11%. The uptick in comparable net sales can be attributed to the positive net price realization in all the company’s segments. Organic sales increased across all businesses, backed by the company’s portfolio strength and efforts to manage cost inflation and supply-chain headwinds.Based on a strong performance and continued business momentum, management pulled up its net sales and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) views for fiscal 2023. For fiscal 2023, SJM anticipates net sales to rise 5.5-6.5%, up from the previous view of 4-5%. The adjusted EPS for fiscal 2023 is envisioned in the $8.35-$8.75 band, up from the earlier $8.20-$8.60 band. The bottom-line view reflects the positive impact of pricing and share buybacks (of the prior year), more than negated by inflated costs, an expected volume/mix effect of the price elasticity of demand, an adverse impact of the product recall and elevated SD&amp;A expenses.Story continuesPricing Actions SolidThe J. M. Smucker has been benefiting from positive net price realization, which was also witnessed in the second quarter of fiscal 2023, with higher net price realization contributing 17 percentage points to the top-line growth. Net sales growth was mainly backed by positive net price realization in the company segments. Management’s raised sales guidance for fiscal 2023 reflects the positive impacts of elevated net pricing to counter cost inflation in many categories.Solid Away from Home &amp; Coffee BusinessThe J. M. Smucker Company is gaining from strength in the International and Away from Home divisions. This was witnessed in second-quarter fiscal 2023, with net sales advancing 14% to $297.9 million. Excluding divestitures and currency headwinds, net sales rose 19% for the Away from Home division, driven by double-digit growth for coffee and Uncrustables sandwiches. The segment’s profit climbed 3% to $41.5 million, mainly reflecting a favorable net impact of positive net price realization and higher commodity costs somewhat offset by lower contribution from volume/mix.Talking of the coffee business, the overall coffee portfolio looks encouraging as at-home coffee remains strong, despite inflationary pressures given consumers’ daily coffee habits. In the coffee category, net sales grew 10%, led by all brands in the market-leading at-home coffee portfolio during the second quarter of fiscal 2023. The company’s Café Bustelo and Folgers brands are doing well in the category.Focus on Core StrategiesThe J. M. Smucker is progressing well with core priorities, which include driving commercial excellence, reshaping its portfolio, streamlining cost structure and unleashing its organization to win. Strength in such strategies is helping the company navigate complex supply chain challenges. These are also helping the company improve in-store fundamentals and stock performance for the brands. The company is implementing inflation-justified pricing actions across all businesses. The company is committed to increasing its focus and resources to reshape its portfolio and achieve sustainable growth across pet food and snacks, coffee and snacking categories. Management has been optimizing its supply chain, lowering discretionary costs and expanding network production efficiencies to streamline costs.We believe that well-chalked core strategies along with the above-mentioned upsides will likely keep SJM’s growth story going.3 Solid Staple PicksSome other top-ranked stocks are Conagra Brands CAG, Lamb Weston LW and Mondelez International, Inc.

We will especially look at how to simplify and fast-track permitting for new clean tech production sites,"" she said in a speech at the meeting.""To keep European industry attractive, there is a need to be competitive with the offers and incentives that are currently available outside the EU,"" von der Leyen added.Earlier, International Energy Agency (IEA) executive director Fatih Birol told a WEF panel that energy security was now the biggest driver of climate investment.Birol said the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed by President Joe Biden last year, would drive investment into cleaner energy and represented the most important climate deal since the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement.This view was echoed by Larry Fink, chief executive of the world's biggest asset manager BlackRock, who told an event on the sidelines of the WEF meeting that moves by the U.S. government to finance a faster shift in the world's biggest economy, through the IRA was a ""game changer"".'MONEY, MONEY, MONEY'U.S. climate envoy John Kerry told a separate panel on financing the transition to a low carbon economy that the only way to avoid catastrophic damage caused by climate change was for governments and companies to spend big.Story continues""How do we get there? The lesson I have learned in the last years ... is money, money, money, money, money, money, money,"" Kerry said of what was needed for the world to stand any chance of meeting the 2015 Paris Agreement goal of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.While European countries have welcomed the new commitment to energy transition by Biden's administration, some fear it may disadvantage their companies.""I understand the importance of the Act from a U.S. perspective but on the other side I should also think about European interests,"" Jozef Sikela, the Czech minister of industry and trade, said on the same WEF panel as Birol.Europe's energy crisis, triggered by Russia's invasion of Ukraine last year, has been felt across the 27-member EU, with gas prices almost 90% higher last year than the year before.Sikela said European households and industries were paying the biggest bill for the global energy crisis, while the new U.S. legislation would pull away investors and force governments into a ""dangerous"" competition on subsidies.'TARGETED SUPPORT'Von der Leyen later told reporters that the proposed fund - an idea she first raised in September which does not yet have the support of all EU governments, notably Germany - would disburse both grants and loans.She said that as the EU prepares to set up this fund - aimed at making domestic industries more competitive, especially against U.S. and Asian businesses - a bridging solution for the financing of green industry would also involve loans and grants.""We need a very clear message and signal now to the clean-tech industry that Europe is their home and future and it's worth to invest here,"" she told reporters in Davos.""As this will take some time, we will look at a bridging solution to provide fast and targeted support where it is most needed,"" she said, without giving any details, adding that the Commission was pinning down the needs of the green industry.Vicki Hollub, chief executive of U.S. oil producer Occidental Petroleum Corp, earlier called the U.S. legislation one of the most transformative bills ever signed.But she rounded on European governments for taxing fossil fuel firms that were also developing renewable energy.""With all due respect to Europe, I hate to say it but I have to say it, imposing windfall profit tax on the oil companies that are doing their best to grow wind and solar in Europe was not the smartest move, in my opinion,"" Hollub said.Subsidies are very important for the development of new technologies, she told the WEF panel with Birol and Sikela.

Stocks recently featured in the blog include: The Boeing Company BA, Textron Inc. TXT, Lockheed LMT and Northrop Grumman NOCHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:Bell-Boeing Secures Contract to Support V-22 Aircraft ProgramBell-Boeing, a joint venture (JV) between The Boeing Company and Bell Helicopter — a unit of Textron Inc. — recently secured a modification contract involving the V-22 aircraft. The Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD has awarded the deal.Details of the DealValued at $23.4 million, the contract is expected to be completed by January 2024. Per the terms of the deal, Bell-Boeing will offer continued flight test support for the V-22 aircraft.The contract will serve the U.S. Navy, Air Force, and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers. Work related to this deal will be executed in Patuxent River, MD.Growing Jet Demand &amp; V-22 JetsA rapid increase in terror attacks has compelled nations to strengthen their arsenal and bump up their defense budget. With the United States being the largest exporter of defense equipment across the world, there is a steady flow of contracts for its combat-proven weaponry from both Pentagon and its foreign allies. With military jets and helicopters constituting a major portion of a nation's armaments, there is a steady flow of contracts for these.Bell-Boeing's primary product, V-22 Osprey is a family of multi-mission, tiltrotor military aircraft with both vertical as well as short takeoff and landing capabilities. It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft. Notably, the CV-22 is a variant of the V-22 family of jets and helps conduct long-range infiltration, exfiltration and resupply missions for special operations forces.Story continuesConsidering these features of the aforementioned family of tiltrotors and the growing demand for military aircraft, V-22 and its variants enjoy decent demand across the globe. The latest deal win is a bright example of that.Jet Manufacturers' ProspectsPer a forecast made by Mordor Intelligence, the global military aviation market size is projected to register a CAGR of 5.4% during the 2022-2028 period. This surely is going to benefit major U.S. combat aircraft manufacturers like Bell-Boeing, Lockheed and Northrop Grumman, with North America dominating this market space.Lockheed Martin is one of the pioneers in the combat aircraft space, with its product portfolio constituting some of the most advanced military aircraft like F-35, C-130, F-16, F-22 and a few more. Of these, F-35 is the company's largest program.Lockheed boasts a long-term earnings growth rate of 6.2%.

236,b36aa1cd-ea06-3d23-ab0a-5884bf3fd15a,NSC,2023-01-17,Is a Beat in Store for Canadian National (CNI) in Q4 Earnings?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/beat-store-canadian-national-cni-114211757.html,1673955731,STORY,"['CNI', 'NSC']","[Canadian National Railway Company CNI is scheduled to report fourth-quarter 2022 results on Jan 24, after market close.The company has an impressive earnings surprise history, having outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in three of the preceding four quarters (missing the mark in one), the average beat being 6.7%.Let's delve deeper to unearth the factors that are likely to have influenced CNI’s fourth-quarter 2022 performance.We expect upbeat freight demand and favorable pricing to have boosted Canadian National’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter. Owing to the strong freight conditions, revenues at the Petroleum and Chemicals, Metals and Minerals, Coal, Intermodal and Automotive segments are likely to have impressive. This in turn is expected to have boosted the railroad operator’s top line in the fourth quarter.Fuel surcharge revenues are also likely to have been high and may have driven the top line. Owing to favorable revenues, operating ratio (operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues) is likely to have improved on a year-over-year basis in the December quarter. On the flip side, the bottom-line growth is likely to have been restricted due to elevated operating expenses, driven by high fuel price.What Our Model SaysOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for CNI this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Canadian National has an Earnings ESP of +0.51% (the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate are presently pegged at $1.57 and $1.56 per share, respectively) and a Zacks Rank #3.Highlights of Q3Third-quarter 2022 earnings of $1.63 per share (C$2.13) outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.51 per share and improved 34.7% year over year. Quarterly revenues of $3,459.8 million (C$4,513 million) outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3,214.2 million and increased 21.3% year over year. The uptick was driven by higher fuel surcharge revenues backed by higher fuel prices, freight rate increases, higher Canadian export volumes of coal via west coast ports, higher volumes of U.S. grain and the positive translation impact of a weaker Canadian dollar.Story continuesOther Stocks to ConsiderHere are a few other stocks from the broader Zacks Transportation sector that investors may consider as well, since our model shows that these too have the right combination of elements to beat on their fourth-quarter 2022 earnings.JetBlue Airways JBLU has an Earnings ESP of +9.81% and a Zacks Rank #3. JBLU will release results on Jan 26.We expect upbeat air-travel demand to have aided JBLU’s fourth-quarter performance. However, high costs may have been a dampener.Norfolk Southern Corporation NSC has an Earnings ESP of +0.55% and a Zacks Rank #3. NSC will release results on Jan 25.We expect the upbeat demand scenario to have aided NSC’s fourth-quarter performance.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH), The Coca-Cola Company (KO) and Roche Holding AG (RHHBY). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.You can see all of today’s research reports here &gt;&gt;&gt;Shares of UnitedHealth Group have gained +4.5% over the past year against the Zacks Medical sector's -12% decline and -15.7% decline for the S&amp;P 500 index. The company’s top line has been growing and the momentum should continue in the years ahead on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings.The company's solid health services segment provides diversification benefits. UNH's Government business remains well-poised for growth. A sturdy balance sheet enables investments.However, softness in commercial business due to COVID-induced volatilities persists. Rising operating costs are hurting margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth Group here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Coca-Cola held up a lot better than many others in last year's tough market; the stock was effectively flat in 2022, modestly better than rival Pepsi's -0.3% decline, but significantly better than the Zacks Consumer Staple sector's -5.1% decline (the market overall was down -15.7%). The company is scheduled to report 2022 Q4 results on February 14th, but its preceding period results (2022 Q3) benefited from the continued momentum from the first half of 2022. Sales gained from revenue growth across its operating segments, aided by an improved price/mix and an increase in concentrate sales.Coca-Cola benefited from underlying share gains in both at-home and away-from-home channels. According to the Zacks analyst estimate organic revenue growth of 14.8% and comparable earnings per share growth of 6.6%, in line with the company’s raised view for 2022. Innovations and accelerating digital investments bode well.However, pressures from higher transportation and input costs remain. Higher marketing spends and currency headwinds are concerning.(You can read the full research report on Coca-Cola here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Shares of Roche Holding have underperformed the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry over the past year (-21.6% vs. +14.6%). The company’s performance has been hit by significantly lower COVID-related sales in both divisions as the pandemic eased out. Sales of Actemra/RoActemra and Ronapreve (COVID-19) are declining with the pandemic weakening in several countries since last year. The competition is stiff for Tecentriq. The decline in sales of drugs like Herceptin, Avastin and MabThera will continue to drag sales down. Pipeline setbacks are a concern.Nevertheless, strong demand for new drugs, namely Hemlibra (hemophilia), Ocrevus (multiple sclerosis), Evrysdi (spinal muscular atrophy), Phesgo (cancer) and Tecentriq (cancer), maintained momentum. The Diagnostics division also remained stable in terms of the growth of its routine business.(You can read the full research report on Roche Holding here &gt;&gt;&gt;)Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Lockheed Martin Corporation (LMT), Lam Research Corporation (LRCX) and Valero Energy Corporation (VLO).Director of ResearchSheraz MianNote: Sheraz Mian heads the Zacks Equity Research department and is a well-regarded expert of aggregate earnings.

Yet, the U.S. government's tiff with Turkey over its involvement in Russia's S-400 may hurt F-35 program.Lam Research (LRCX) Benefits From Strengthening NAND DemandPer the Zacks analyst, increasing NAND requirement in accelerating 5G migration, video, and new game consoles is driving the top-line growth of Lam Research.Valero Energy (VLO) Banks on its Renewable Diesel BusinessThe Zacks analyst likes Valero Energy since it continues to bank on its lucrative lower-carbon renewable diesel business. However, rising costs and expenses hurt the firm's bottom line.Digitization &amp; Expansion Initiatives to Aid AutoZone (AZO)While the ramp up of e-commerce efforts and the rollout of hubs and mega-hubs are fueling AutoZone's top-line growth, the Zacks analyst is worried about the firm's rising debt pile.Welltower (WELL) to Grow on Portfolio-Restructuring EffortsPer the Zacks analystp, Welltower's portfolio-restructuring moves bode well for long-term sustainability and cash-flow growth. However, rising interest rates remain a key concern for the company.Ulta Beauty (ULTA) Gains on Robust Omnichannel OperationsPer the Zacks analyst, Ulta Beauty has been gaining on its robust omnichannel initiatives. Its buy online pickup in-store has been a key driver, contributing 23% to third-quarter e-commerce sales.Product Launches Aid Masimo (MASI) Amid Stiff CompetitionThe Zacks analyst is upbeat about Masimo's product launches over the past few months despite its operation in a highly competitive market.New UpgradesRecurring Revenues &amp; Technology Growth Aid Envestnet (ENV)Per the Zacks analyst, Envestnet's business model ensures solid asset-based and subscription-based recurring revenue generation capacity. Also, focus on technology development is a tailwind.Growing Electronic Warfare Systems Demand Aid Mercury (MRCY)Per the Zacks Analyst, high demand for electronic warfare, increased upgrades on electronic subsystems and continued flow of deals are aiding Mercury Systems' growth.Strong Performance of IoT Business Aids Blackberry (BB)Per the Zacks analyst, Blackberry is expected to benefit from continued demand for its IoT businesses supported by a robust pipeline of design wins. Also, frequent product launches bode well.New DowngradesHalozyme (HALO) Issues Weak Financial Guidance for 2023Though Halozyme issued financial guidance for 2023 which show growth over previous year's revenue and earnings figures, the Zacks Analyst is concerned as these estimates fell below our estimates.Antero Resources (AR) Hurts By Lower Gas Production VolumesThe Zacks analyst is concerned about Antero Resources' falling natural-gas-equivalent production volumes, which will continue to hurt its bottom line as the fuel contributes mostly to its production.Supply Chain And Inflation Woes Hurt Leggett's (LEG) GrowthAs per the Zacks analyst, inflation, tightened monetary policy, supply chain disruptions and softened consumer demand are hurting Leggett's growth.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

(NASDAQ:COKE)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-coca-cola-133412588.html,1673876052,STORY,"['KO', 'COKE']","[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Coca-Cola Consolidated, Inc. (NASDAQ:COKE) as an investment opportunity by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola Consolidated The ModelWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Seeing as no analyst estimates of free cash flow are available to us, we have extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the company's last reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$226.7mUS$222.7mUS$221.3mUS$221.6mUS$223.1mUS$225.5mUS$228.5mUS$232.1mUS$235.9mUS$240.1mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceEst @ -3.39%Est @ -1.78%Est @ -0.65%Est @ 0.14%Est @ 0.69%Est @ 1.08%Est @ 1.35%Est @ 1.54%Est @ 1.67%Est @ 1.76% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.8% US$212US$195US$182US$170US$161US$152US$144US$137US$131US$124(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.6bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.8%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$240m× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.8%– 2.0%) = US$5.1bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$5.1b÷ ( 1 + 6.8%)10= US$2.6bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$4.2b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$495, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Coca-Cola Consolidated as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.8%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here: https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2039167/is-berkshire-hathaway-a-value-stock)Is Berkshire Hathaway Really a Value Stock?Welcome to Episode #312 of the Value Investor Podcast.(0:45) - Value Stocks Back In Favor: Should You jump On The Warren Buffett Bandwagon?(6:00) - Ark Invest vs Berkshire Hathaway: What Fits Best Into Your Portfolio?(21:00) - Episode Roundup: BRKB, ARKK, AAPL, BAC, KO, AXP, TSM, CVX, EXAS, ZM, TSLA Podcast@Zacks.comEvery week, Tracey Ryniec, the editor of Zacks Value Investor portfolio, shares some of her top value investing tips and stock picks.With value stocks out performing in 2022, value investing has come back into favor.And that means the cult of Warren Buffett, and Berkshire Hathaway, is back. At the end of 2022, there was a chart making the rounds on Twitter that compared Cathie Wood's ARK Innovation performance over the last 5 years with Berkshire Hathaway's.As you might have guessed, Berkshire Hathaway is outperforming thanks to ARKK's terrible 2022. Over the last 5 years, Berkshire Hathaway is up 76.3% while ARKK is down 18.9%.Meanwhile, many investors are diving into Berkshire Hathaway's stock in search of safety. Over the last three months, Berkshire's B shares are up 19.3% versus the S&amp;P 500's gain of 10.5%.But is Berkshire Hathaway itself even a value stock?Should value investors be investing in the stock, and its large holdings?Is there Value in Berkshire Hathaway? 1.       Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) Berkshire Hathaway is a large cap holding company that owns dozens of businesses, cash and equity investments. Reminder: it's not a mutual fund or an ETF fund. It's a corporation with Warren Buffett as Chairman and CEO.Story continuesBerkshire Hathaway trades with a forward P/E of 19, which is more expensive than the S&amp;P 500 and is not in the normal range for most value investors. Tracey usually looks for companies trading under 15.What about its PEG ratio? Berkshire Hathaway has a PEG of 2.7, which does not indicate value either. A PEG under 1.0 indicates a company has growth and value.However, Berkshire does have a P/B ratio of 1.5, which is under 3.0, and indicates value.Is a low P/B ratio enough for value investors or should they wait for a sell-off in the Berkshire Hathaway shares?2.       Apple Corp. AAPL Apple is Berkshire's largest equity holding. It was cheap when Buffett first bought it in 2016, with a forward P/E of around 10.But in 2023, it is trading at 21x, which is much higher than the S&amp;P 500 which is trading around 18. Apple has a PEG of 1.7.Additionally, earnings are expected to rise just 1% in fiscal 2023 so there isn't much growth there either.Should value investors take a pass on Apple?3.       Bank of America BAC Bank of America is Berkshire's second largest holding, and has been for several years. Warren Buffett has been patient with Bank of America, even while selling many of his other bank stocks.Shares of Bank of America are down 30% in the last year. It's cheap with a forward P/E of 9.5. But with banks, investors should also look at P/B ratio. Bank of America's is 1.15. With banks, a P/B ratio near 1.0 indicates there's value.Should investors join Buffett and add Bank of America to their own short list?4.       Chevron Corp. (CVX) Chevron suddenly became the third largest position in Berkshire's portfolio, at 8%, last year when Buffett went all in on the energy stocks.Chevron shares surged in 2022, rising 36.9% as energy was the best performing sector for the second year in a row. But it remains cheap as earnings have also risen. Chevron is trading with a forward P/E of just 10.8.It's yielding 3.2% now.Should you follow Buffett into the energy trade, or is it too late to jump into Chevron?5.       The Coca-Cola Company KO Coca-Cola has been in the Berkshire portfolio since the first quarter of 2001. Berkshire has held it through the Great Recession and the pandemic. It's still the fourth largest position in the portfolio.Coca-Cola shares are up 25% over the last 2 years, versus just 5.4% for the S&amp;P 500.But shares aren't cheap. It trades with a forward P/E of 24.4. And Coca-Cola has a PEG ratio of 3.9.Is Coca-Cola too expensive for value investors in 2023?What Else Should You Know About Berkshire Hathaway to Start 2023?Listen to this week's podcast to find out.[In full disclosure, Tracey owns BAC in Zacks Value Investor portfolio.]Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

244,01c61baf-4c74-30c4-b6da-9cab474de557,MHK,2023-01-17,Mohawk Provides Litigation and Earnings Guidance Update,GlobeNewswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mohawk-provides-litigation-earnings-guidance-211000963.html,1673903400,STORY,['MHK'],"[Mohawk Industries, Inc.CALHOUN, Ga., Jan. 16, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Mohawk Industries, Inc. (NYSE: MHK), the world’s largest floor covering manufacturer, today announced that it has entered into an agreement with plaintiffs to resolve the previously disclosed securities class action lawsuit. Mohawk and certain of its executive officers were named as defendants in this lawsuit initially filed on January 3, 2020, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia (the “Securities Class Action”). Mohawk believes that this Securities Class Action is without merit and that it has substantive defenses to the claims of liability and damages; however, Mohawk has concluded that further litigation would be protracted, burdensome and expensive. In exchange for dismissal and a full release of claims against the defendants, the parties reached an agreement to settle the Securities Class Action for $60 million, of which a significant portion is covered by insurance. The settlement of the Securities Class Action is expected to be submitted for preliminary approval by the court. The settlement of this case is subject to the usual and customary final documentation, public notice, and court approval.Mohawk has also successfully settled a previously disclosed dispute with the Belgian Tax Authority (“BTA”) regarding the tax treatment of royalty income arising from intellectual property. In April 2022, the BTA issued a tax assessment of approximately €187 million (including penalties but excluding interest) for the calendar years ending December 2013 through 2018. Although Mohawk believes its tax position in Belgium is correct, Mohawk entered into an agreement with the BTA on November 23, 2022, to settle the dispute for a one-time payment of €3 million.Since Mohawk issued its third quarter earnings release on October 27, 2022, the U.S. Federal Reserve has announced two additional interest rate increases. These increases, combined with continuing high inflation and lagging consumer confidence in the U.S. and Europe, resulted in the global residential flooring business softening more than the Company expected in the fourth quarter. In response, the Company increased temporary plant shutdowns, which further compressed margins and lowered quarterly results. In addition, demand in Flooring North America weakened more than the other segments, which led to actions to reduce its inventory levels. The combination of the lower volume, plant shutdowns and the consumption of higher cost carpet inventory decreased the segment’s financial performance for the quarter. Due to these factors, the Company’s fourth quarter adjusted EPS is expected to be between $1.27 and $1.31, excluding any restructuring or other one-time charges. The Company’s complete fourth quarter and full-year results, as well as guidance for the first quarter of 2023, will be included in the fourth quarter earnings release on February 9, 2023, with more extensive commentary to follow during the quarterly investor call on February 10, 2023.Story continuesThe Company is in the process of completing its accounting processes and preparing its fourth quarter and full year 2022 financial statements.  As a result, the preliminary financial results presented in this release are based on current expectations and may be adjusted as a result of, among other things, completion of the Company’s financial closing procedures and annual audit and other developments that may arise between now and the time these financial results are finalized.   Furthermore, the adjusted EPS financial measure presented in this release is calculated consistent with how the Company has historically calculated adjusted EPS and excludes certain items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, the Company’s core operating performance.ABOUT MOHAWK INDUSTRIESMohawk Industries is the leading global flooring manufacturer that creates products to enhance residential and commercial spaces around the world. Mohawk’s vertically integrated manufacturing and distribution processes provide competitive advantages in the production of carpet, rugs, ceramic tile, laminate, wood, stone, and vinyl flooring.

During the past decade, Mohawk has transformed its business from an American carpet manufacturer into the world’s largest flooring company with operations in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Europe, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, and the United States.Certain of the statements in the immediately preceding paragraphs, particularly anticipating fourth quarter and year end results, future performance, business prospects, growth and operating strategies and similar matters and those that include the words “could,” “should,” “believes,” “anticipates,” “expects,” and “estimates,” or similar expressions constitute “forward-looking statements.” For those statements, Mohawk claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. There can be no assurance that the forward-looking statements will be accurate because they are based on many assumptions, which involve risks and uncertainties. The following important factors could cause future results to differ: changes in economic or industry conditions; competition; inflation and deflation in raw material prices and other input costs; inflation and deflation in consumer markets; energy costs and supply; timing and level of capital expenditures; timing and implementation of price increases for the Company’s products; impairment charges; integration of acquisitions; international operations; introduction of new products; rationalization of operations; taxes and tax reform; product and other claims; litigation; the risks and uncertainty related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and other risks identified in Mohawk’s SEC reports and public announcements.Contact: James Brunk, Chief Financial Officer (706) 624-2239]"

(NYSE:WM)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-fair-value-waste-management-120028534.html,1673956828,STORY,['WM'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) as an investment opportunity by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Waste Management Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.88bUS$2.66bUS$3.03bUS$3.09bUS$3.45bUS$3.66bUS$3.84bUS$3.99bUS$4.13bUS$4.25bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x13Analyst x11Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 6.13%Est @ 4.89%Est @ 4.01%Est @ 3.40%Est @ 2.98% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9% US$1.7kUS$2.3kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.4kUS$2.3kUS$2.3kUS$2.2kUS$2.1kUS$2.0k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$22bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.3b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.0%) = US$73bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$73b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$34bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$56b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$154, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Waste Management as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.986. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Waste ManagementStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Commercial Services market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

(NYSE:DVA) has a market capitalization of $7.121 billion.Moon Capital made the following comment about DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“During the fourth quarter, we purchased shares in DaVita Inc. (NYSE:DVA), a dialysis center operator. For those unfamiliar, kidney dialysis involves the critical removal of toxins, fluids and salts from the blood by artificial means. Roughly 500,000 patients receive kidney dialysis in the U.S., which requires a 3.5-hour treatment three times a week. The only alternatives to the treatments are a kidney transplant or potential fatality. Given the critical nature of its services, demand has little correlation with the overall economy, resulting in a highly recession resistant business.The U.S. dialysis industry is highly concentrated, with two companies (DaVita and its competitor Fresenius) controlling a combined 80% of the $25 billion market. The dominance of this duopoly provides massive scale advantages, making it incredibly difficult for new entrants to gain profitable market share.In the past, DaVita’s valuation has been penalized (we view unfairly) because the company generates a significant portion of its operating income from a small percentage of its patients. Of DaVita’s 200,000 patients, approximately 90% qualify for Medicare (or Medicaid), with the remaining 10% covered by a commercial insurance provider. While commercial insurers pay an average of $1,000 per treatment, the federal government’s pay rate for Medicare and Medicaid is only $275 – which is actually less than what it costs DVA to provide the treatment…”(Click here to read the full text)Story continuessmart.art/Shutterstock.comDaVita Inc.

Ongoing measures exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, results from our ongoing operations and provide a better baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Sales excluding foreign currency is calculated by translating the current period net sales, in functional currency, to U.S. dollars using the prior-year period's exchange rate compared to the prior-year period net sales. Management believes that sales excluding foreign currency provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time, excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations. Management believes that organic net sales provides stockholders with a clearer basis to assess our results over time, excluding the impact of exchange rate fluctuations and divestitures. Management believes that ROIC provides investors with a view of capital efficiency, a key driver of stockholder value creation. Management believes that adjusted tax rate provides investors with a meaningful, consistent comparison of the Company's effective tax rate, excluding the pre-tax income and tax effect of certain unique items. Management believes that free cash flow provides investors and stockholders with a relevant measure of liquidity and a useful basis for assessing the company's ability to fund its activities and obligations. The Company provides free cash flow related metrics, such as free cash flow as a percentage of net sales, as long-term management goals, not an element of its annual financial guidance, and as such does not provide a reconciliation of free cash flow to cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, for these long-term goal metrics. Whirlpool does not provide a non-GAAP reconciliation for its forward-looking long-term value creation goals, such as organic net sales, EBIT, free cash flow conversion, ROIC and gross debt/EBITDA, as these long-term management goals are not annual guidance, and the reconciliation of these long-term measures would rely on market factors and certain other conditions and assumptions that are outside of the company's control. We believe that these non-GAAP measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and stockholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance, and reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of our business. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These ongoing financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported net earnings available to Whirlpool per diluted share, net earnings, net earnings available to Whirlpool, net earnings margin, return on assets, net sales, effective tax rate and cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. We also disclose segment EBIT as an important financial metric used by the Company's Chief Operating Decision Maker to evaluate performance and allocate resources in accordance with ASC 280 - Segment Reporting. GAAP net earnings available to Whirlpool per diluted share and ongoing earnings per diluted share are presented net of tax, while individual adjustments in each reconciliation are presented on a pre-tax basis; the income tax impact line item aggregates the tax impact for these adjustments. The tax impact of individual line item adjustments may not foot precisely to the aggregate income tax impact amount, as each line item adjustment may include non-taxable components. Historical quarterly earnings per share amounts are presented based on a normalized tax rate adjustment to reconcile quarterly tax rates to full-year tax rate expectations. We strongly encourage investors and stockholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.FULL YEAR 2022 ONGOING EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHAREThe preliminary results for the full-year ended December 31, 2022, are estimates based on information available to management as of the date of this release, are still subject to procedures by our independent auditor, and are subject to further changes upon completion of the company's year-end closing procedures. The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures ongoing earnings before interest and taxes and ongoing earnings per diluted share, with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, net earnings (loss) available to Whirlpool and net (loss) per basic share available to Whirlpool, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 (estimated and unaudited).  The (loss) per basic share GAAP measure and ongoing measure are presented net of tax, while each adjustment is presented on a pre-tax basis. Our full-year GAAP tax rate was ~21% (estimated). The aggregate income tax impact of the taxable components of each adjustment is presented in the income tax impact line item at our  full-year adjusted tax rate (non-GAAP) of ~4% (estimated).Twelve Months EndedEarnings Before Interest &amp; Taxes Reconciliation: (amounts estimated and unaudited)December 31, 2022(unaudited)Net earnings (loss) available to Whirlpool~$(1,535)Net earnings (loss) available to noncontrolling interests~10Income tax expense (benefit)~260Interest expense~190Earnings before interest &amp; taxes~$(1,075) (amounts estimated and unaudited)Results classificationEarnings before interest &amp; taxes(unaudited)Earnings per diluted share(unaudited)Reported measure~$(1,075)~$(27.50)Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles(d)Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles~385~6.89Impact of M&amp;A transactions(b)Selling, general and administrative~1,900~33.98Preliminary additional  fourth quarter adjusting items(f)Various~125~2.24Total income tax impact—~(1.81)Normalized tax rate adjustment(e)—~5.65Share adjustment*—~(0.20)Ongoing measure~$1,335~$19.25 Note: Numbers may not reconcile due to rounding*As a result of our current period GAAP earnings loss, the impact of antidilutive shares was excluded from the loss per share calculation on a GAAP basis. The share count adjustment used in the calculation of the full-year ongoing earnings per diluted share includes basic shares outstanding of 55.9 million plus the impact of antidilutive shares of 0.6 million which were excluded on a GAAP basis.FULL YEAR 2021 ONGOING EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST AND TAXES AND ONGOING EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE The reconciliation provided below reconciles the non-GAAP financial measures ongoing earnings before interest and taxes and ongoing earnings per diluted share, with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, net earnings available to Whirlpool and net earnings per diluted share available to Whirlpool, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021. The earnings per diluted share GAAP measure and ongoing measure are presented net of tax, while each adjustment is presented on a pre-tax basis. Our full-year GAAP tax rate was 22.2%. The aggregate income tax impact of the taxable components of each adjustment is presented in the income tax impact line item at our full-year adjusted tax rate (non-GAAP) of 23.5%.Twelve Months EndedEarnings Before Interest &amp; Taxes Reconciliation:December 31, 2021Net earnings (loss) available to Whirlpool$                                  1,783Net earnings (loss) available to noncontrolling interests23Income tax expense (benefit)518Interest expense175Earnings (loss) before interest &amp; taxes$                                  2,499 Results classificationEarnings before interest &amp; taxesEarnings per diluted shareReported measure$                   2,499$                  28.36Restructuring costs(a)Restructuring costs380.61Impact of M&amp;A transactions (b)(Gain) loss on sale and disposal of businesses(107)(1.69)(Gain) loss on previously held equity interest(c)(Gain) loss on previously held equity interest(42)(0.50)Product warranty and liability (income) expense(g)Cost of products sold(9)(0.14)Income tax impact—0.41Normalized tax rate adjustment(e)—(0.46)Ongoing measure$                   2,379$                  26.59 Note: Numbers may not reconcile due to rounding FOOTNOTESa.  RESTRUCTURING COST - In 2022, and moving forward, we will only exclude restructuring actions greater than $50 million from our ongoing results. In 2021, these costs were primarily related to actions that right-size and reduce the fixed cost structure of our EMEA business and other centralized functions.b.  IMPACT OF M&amp;A TRANSACTIONS - In January 2023, we signed a contribution agreement to contribute our European major domestic appliance business into a newly formed entity with Arçelik. In connection with the transaction, the Company recorded a non-cash loss on disposal of approximately $1.5 billion in the fourth-quarter of 2022. The loss includes a charge of approximately $1.1 billion for the write down of the net assets of the EMEA business to the fair value of the initial consideration to be received and approximately $400 million of cumulative currency translation adjustments. Whirlpool's European business met the criteria for held-for-sale accounting during the fourth-quarter of 2022. Until the closing of the transaction, Whirlpool's European business will be included in the Company's results.During the second quarter of 2022, we entered into an agreement to sell our Russia business. We classified this disposal group as held for sale and recorded an impairment loss of $346 million for the write-down of the assets to their fair value. During the third quarter of 2022, the loss from disposal was adjusted by an immaterial amount resulting in a final loss amount of $348 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2022.Additionally, we incurred unique transaction related costs of approximately $45 million related to portfolio transformation for the nine months ended September 30, 2022. These transaction costs are recorded in Selling, general and administrative expenses on our Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income (Loss).On May 17, 2021, our subsidiary entered into a share purchase agreement to sell its Turkish subsidiary to Arçelik. As part of the agreement, Arçelik assumed responsibility for operating the manufacturing site in Manisa, Turkey, following closing. The transaction closed on June 30, 2021. In connection with the closing of the transaction, we received cash proceeds of $93 million and recognized a loss on sale of $164 million. During the third quarter of 2021, amounts for working capital and other customary post-closing adjustments were finalized and an additional $13 million loss related to the sale of business was recorded.On March 31, 2021, Galanz launched its partial tender offer for majority ownership of Whirlpool China. Our subsidiary tendered approximately 31% of Whirlpool China's outstanding shares in the tender offer, with the remainder representing a noncontrolling interest of approximately 20% in Whirlpool China. The transaction closed on May 6, 2021. In connection with the closing of the transaction, we received cash proceeds of $193 million and recognized a gain on sale of $284 million.The net impact realized for gain on sale and disposal of businesses included in the income  statement for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 is $105 million.c.  (GAIN) LOSS ON PREVIOUSLY HELD EQUITY INTEREST - During the third quarter of 2021, Whirlpool Corporation acquired an additional 38% equity interest in Elica PB India Private Limited (Elica PB India) for $57 million, which resulted in a controlling equity ownership of approximately 87%. The previously held equity interest of 49% in Elica PB India was remeasured at fair value of $74 million on the acquisition date, which resulted in a gain of $42 million. This gain was recorded within Interest &amp; sundry (income) expense during the third quarter. The earnings per diluted share impact is calculated net of minority interest.d.  IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLES - The carrying value of the EMEA reporting unit and Indesit and Hotpoint trademarks exceeded their fair values resulting in an impairment charge of $384 million during the second quarter of 2022.e.  NORMALIZED TAX RATE ADJUSTMENT -  During the full year of 2022, the Company calculated ongoing earnings per share using an adjusted tax rate of approximately 4% which excludes the impacts of the non-tax deductible loss on sale of the Russia business of $348 million and impairment of goodwill of $278 million, along with the impact of M&amp;A transactions of approximately $1.5 billion. During the full year of 2021, the Company calculated ongoing earnings per share using an adjusted tax rate of 23.5%.f.  PRELIMINARY ADDITIONAL FOURTH QUARTER 2022 ADJUSTING ITEMS -  In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Company substantially liquidated an offshore subsidiary, resulting in a one time noncash adjustment to earnings related to release of other comprehensive income on hedging and cumulative translation adjustments, incurred incremental M&amp;A transaction costs outside of the EMEA strategic assessment and recorded an impairment on a joint venture in the Latin America operating segment. Additional details will be provided during the Company's fourth quarter 2022 earnings release.g.  PRODUCT WARRANTY AND LIABILITY (INCOME) EXPENSE - During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company released an accrual of approximately $9 million related to a previously announced EMEA-produced washer recall campaign. These adjustments were made based on our revised expectations regarding future period cash expenditures for the campaign.FREE CASH FLOWThe preliminary results for the full-year ended December 31, 2022, are estimates based on information available to management as of the date of this release, are still subject to procedures by our independent auditor, and are subject to further changes upon completion of the company's year-end closing procedures. Free cash flow is cash provided by (used in) operating activities after capital expenditures. The reconciliation provided below reconciles twelve months ended December 31, 2022 (estimated) and 2021 free cash flow with cash provided by (used in) operating activities, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow as a percentage of net sales is calculated by dividing free cash flow by net sales.Twelve Months EndedDecember 31, (millions of dollars) (amounts estimated and unaudited for 2022)2022(unaudited)2021Cash provided by (used in) operating activities~$1,400$2,176Capital expenditures~(600)(525)Free cash flow~$800$1,651Estimates for 2022 cash provided by (used in) investing activities and cash provided by (used in) financing activities are not provided as certain year-end close procedures impacting these line items are not yet complete.

Indeed, this sector is critical in tackling key issues such as climate change and energy independence.

Nevertheless, this presents an incredible chance for investors to pick up undervalued renewable energy stocks at multi-year lows.The recent upswing in clean energy stocks we’ve seen in the market reflects growing demand and awareness of geopolitical concerns.

Not only is the company the largest solar panel maker in the world, but it is also perfectly-situated to gain substantially from the escalating public demand for renewable energy sources in multiple countries, such as China, the E.U., and the U.S. Accordingly, JinkoSolar is likely to experience substantial growth in value over time as our society continues its shift toward more sustainable practices.JinkoSolar has been taking market share at an incredible rate, with consistent growth in its top- and bottom-line results. Currently, the company holds a 12.8% market share in the solar P.V. cell market, which is predicted to grow at a 13.6% CAGR until 2027. Jinko’s assets are growing significantly quicker than its liabilities, leaving the company with a massive cash position of over $2 billion. With its attractive price combined with a positive near-term outlook, JinkoSolar is a great option for investors looking to reap the rewards from the rapidly-growing solar sector.Story continuesGeneral Electric (GE)A large General Electric (GE) sign.Source: testing / Shutterstock.comGeneral Electric’s (NYSE:GE) renewables unit is leading the way with innovative technology like its Haliade-X offshore wind turbine. This highly sought-after turbine has propelled the company to great success.Notably, this wind turbine has resulted in the GE winning a major contract for the Dogger Bank project off the coast of England. Construction is already underway, with 277 turbines on order from GE, and profits are soon follow. It’s an exciting time for all associated with this project, particularly General Electrics Renewables Department, which stands to benefit greatly from the Dogger Banks’ many successes.General Electric’s prospects are looking brighter than ever, with the company’s Power and Aviation units set to experience considerable growth due to surging demand for electricity and travel. As more power plants are being built to meet the increasing need for electricity, GE’s Power unit can look forward to increased orders and revenue. Similarly, with more people wanting to travel after months of restrictions, GE’s Aviation unit will likely benefit due to pent-up demand. This upturn in both sectors will pay many dividends for investors down the road.Ørsted (DNNGY)Orsted factory and logoSource: oleschwander / Shutterstock.comØrsted (OTCMKTS:DNNGY) is a prime opportunity for the adventurous investor, providing an array of renewable energy projects with an international scope. As one of Denmark’s largest energy firms, Ørsted has established itself as a global leader in offshore wind power. This is a company that also doesn’t sit on its hands, continuously seeks growth opportunities. The company’s 3,000 MWs of onshore wind power across its U.S.-based farms is just the beginning of its vision under the ongoing shift to green energy.The company owns roughly 22% of the world’s offshore wind generation capacity, and its portfolio contains some of the largest wind farms in Europe. Ørsted is expected to bring substantial amounts of capacity online in Vietnam, France, Japan, The U.S., and other countries in short order. Year-over-year revenue growth numbers have surged over 111%, with its 5-year average revenue growth of over 15% during the period. Additionally, its stock trades at 2.3-times trailing-twelve-month sales, 80% lower than its 5-year average.Plug Power (PLUG)Source: ShutterstockPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) is making tremendous contributions to the green energy revolution by focusing on the hydrogen revolution. Plug not only manufacturers fuel cells for warehouse vehicles like forklifts, but the company also builds plants that produce green hydrogen. Additionally, with its recent business development, Plug Power has become a major supplier of electrolyzers used to make green hydrogen. It is forming innovative partnerships, including with European car manufacturer Renault, to promote green transport further.Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are leading the charge in clean energy with their recent investments in green hydrogen from Plug. Moreover, the company also unveiled a deal to supply hydrogen truck maker Nikola with green hydrogen. Plug Power continues to attract high-profile customers, posting double-digit revenue growth in the past several quarters. Similarly, its order backlog increased by almost 45% sequentially in its third quarter.Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP)The Brookfield Renewable Partners (BEP) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen in front of a digital American flag background.Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.comBrookfield Renewable Partners’ (NYSE:BEP) strong track record of margin growth and its impressive portfolio of renewable energy assets puts it in a prime position to take advantage of the rapidly-growing clean energy market. I think this will deliver impressive returns to investors over time.Rising electricity prices have further insulated the company from rising commodity prices, solidifying its status as one of the top investments in this space. Notably, Brookfield generates the bulk of its revenues from 14-year contracts, which has helped maintain its lofty margins.On average, the firm’s gross profit and EBITDA margins have grown over 60% in the past five years. On top of that, it boasts a remarkable dividend profile that’s growing consistently, while maintaining a payout ratio of roughly 60% to 70% of its funds from operations. The company’s dividend yield of over 4.7% should continue growing based on its profitability and liquidity positioning.Atlantica Sustainable (AY)Water rushing out of a hydroelectric dam.Source: ShutterstockAtlantica Sustainable (NASDAQ:AY) is on a mission to become one of the top names in sustainable energy. With an impressive 41 assets providing renewable energy, efficient natural gas, water projects, and transmission and transport solutions, Atlantica is leading responsible energy production worldwide. With operations spanning three continents, its global reach and commitment to renewable energy sources are second-to-none.Atlantica Sustainable has been enjoying a very positive year. The company’s growth is remarkable, with 4,155 gigawatt hours (GWh) of renewable energy produced and 1,229 miles of transmission lines in operation. Operating cash flow is up by almost 17%, which is higher than expected. This impressive performance ensures that the company’s 6.6% yield is highly secure and sustainable over time. Investors have certainly taken note of these promising results, as well as Atlantica’s seven-year dividend growth streak.Ormat Technologies (ORA)A geothermal power plant operates with a forest and a clear, bright sky visible behind it.Source: N.Minton / Shutterstock.comOrmat Technologies (NYSE:ORA) supplies renewable geothermal energy technology. The company has built over 190 power plants and installed facilities with a combined output of over 3,200 megawatts (MW). Since the start of the year, ORA has gained 15%, outperforming other clean energy stocks.Ormat Technologies is setting the bar high for other companies in the renewable energy sector. Indeed, not only have its shares increased 27% this year, but the company also forecasts that its geothermal and solar power can be expanded by 18% by the end of 2023. Such impressive future growth could make Ormat Technologies one of the leading names in U.S. renewable storage sectors.Hopefully, these ambitious forward forecasts will materialize. Investors stand to benefit from the company’s growth profile and relatively impressive valuation at these levels. That’s because according to Fortune Business Insights, the global geothermal market “is projected to grow from $62.65 billion in 2022 to $95.82 billion by 2029.”On the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Muslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

A question-and-answer session will follow UnitedHealth Group's prepared remarks. As a reminder, this call is being recorded. Here is some important introductory information. This call contains forward-looking statements under U.S. Federal securities laws. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience or present expectations. A description of some of the risks and uncertainties can be found in the reports that we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including the cautionary statements included in our current and periodic filings.This will also reference non-GAAP amounts. A reconciliation of the non-GAAP to GAAP amounts is available on the Financial &amp; Earnings Reports section of the company's Investor Relations page at www.unitedhealthgroup.com. Information presented on this call is contained in the earnings release we issued this morning and in our Form 8-K dated January 13, 2023, which may be accessed from the Investor Relations page of the company's website. I will now turn the conference over to the Chief Executive Officer of UnitedHealth Group, Andrew Witty.Photo by Ani Kolleshi on UnsplashAndrew Witty: Thank you. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. Over the course of the past year, the extraordinary and dedicated people of Optum and UnitedHealthcare delivered strong, well-balanced growth, progress in developing our consumer-orientated capabilities and strengthened the many ways in which we deliver value-based care in multiple settings. Each of the five growth pillars we discussed with you at our November investor conference are powerful sources of opportunities on their own within large and expanding addressable markets. Yet what really unlocks the potential value we can provide to those we serve is the connectivity of capabilities across our enterprise. For example, this year, we expect 4 million people will participate in fully accountable value-based care provided by Optum Health, almost 1.8 million more than we served as we entered 2022.Story continuesWe're achieving this by connecting benefits, care and other services to support our patients. Many of these patients will have a Medicare Advantage plan offered by UnitedHealthcare, or one of the many other payers who are accessing Optum's expertise and capabilities in delivering this kind of comprehensive care. We will serve these patients in clinic settings, in their homes, integrating behavioral care, supported by our data-driven clinical incidents and next best actions, and all coordinated to provide the right care when and where they need it. Pharmacy is another area in which we are more deeply connecting consumers with our services. We engage 1 million people every day, finding the lowest cost options, managing their specialty drugs, offering vital in-person clinical advice at our community pharmacies, providing complex medication treatments right in their homes, or simplifying access through digital solutions in order to make the process uneventful for them.We believe this connectivity is a path to better outcomes for people and lower costs. It's also driving growth. By the end of 2023, we expect to have more than 750 community pharmacies, nearly 200 more than we had at the beginning of 2020. We continue to see the impact these services have at a very local and personal level, helping providers deliver more complete care and better outcomes including medication adherence rates, which are about 90% compared to the 50% U.S. average. Our pharmacists are able to take the time to get to know their patients' treatment plans and support their medication management, collaborating with other care providers. We're guided in pharmacy by the principle of getting to the lowest cost for patients and clients.A good example, as more biosimilars come to market, we're positioned to offer patients their care providers and payers significantly more choices in how to secure the best prices for the therapies they need. In addition to biosimilars, we're driving affordability and prescription benefits by combining formulary and cash market pricing to ensure consumers will always get the best economics. Our life-saving drugs program has made very significant progress since our announcements last year. This program offers zero dollar out-of-pocket cost to consumers for drugs such as insulin and epinephrine. Our goal has been to make this available throughout the U.S. And as of today, we've been approved in 48 states for our fully insured business. Moreover, 1/4 of our self-funded employers have now chosen to add this offering for their employees, and we expect that number to rise.Getting to this point in such a short period of time was only possible through the work not just of our teams, but of state officials and others in the broader healthcare community and we're grateful for their support. Looking to the year ahead, let me focus you on a couple of themes you can expect to hear from us. One is continued scaling of our commitment to American consumers. You should and will have -- who should and will have an increasing influence over their care experience. Through our core innovations, product design, enhanced digital offerings and partnerships such as RVO Health and Walmart, you will see us driving this more broadly across the enterprise, becoming closer to the consumer, helping simplify their experiences and empowering their decision-making with greater transparency, speed, convenience and support.You will also hear how we are amplifying our technology capabilities. 2023 will see the emergence of an enhanced OptumInsight, bringing to life the opportunities that the legacy organizations from Optum and change creates, an acceleration of how technology can be used to healthcare providers and ultimately patients within the overall health system. We start this year well prepared to deliver upon the objectives we shared with you in late November, and with a deep sense of responsibility to do so on behalf of the people we are privileged to serve. With that, I'll turn it over to President and Chief Operating Officer, Dirk McMahon.Dirk McMahon: Thank you, Andrew. While the calendar shows we are two weeks into the new year, our team's 2023 started many months ago; and in some cases, years ago. We have been laying the groundwork necessary to execute on our growth strategy and sustain our momentum heading into this year and beyond. To give you a sense of how this develops, I'll step through some of the work that has been longue durÃ©e to ready our organization to serve even more patients and customers in this new year and provide greater value for consumers across a broad range of initiatives. Take the many new patients we will serve under value-based care arrangements in 2023, deepening our presence in existing areas and adding new regions. Our team's preparations are extensive.That's because the transition to fully accountable care is not simply a matter of downloading a new app. The preparations include significant investments in clinical training, technology, network coordination and other activities to make certain we are ready to serve. These critical investments help us support both our current year needs and establish foundations for the growth into 2024 and beyond. Our ability to serve people effectively has expanded beyond the four-walls of the clinic with the rapid development of our in-home clinical capabilities. These services complement our clinic-based and digital offerings and bring high-quality care access to some of the most challenged and often underserved patients in this country. For instance, for value-based patients, our in-home services have reduced hospital visits by 15% versus fee-for-service, delivering comparable health outcomes and achieving an NPS of approximately 80.Within health benefits, you've heard us discuss how our innovation in commercial products is adding new growth opportunities. One of those is Surest, a unique solution to employers and employees who are looking for first dollar coverage and high transparency into quality and cost. The momentum behind Surest is strong and building. Just two years ago, one in 25 national accounts offered Surest as an option to more traditional plans. Thus far in 2023, it is one in nine, and we expect it will continue to rise. Our offerings for seniors are another area in which we plan, invest and build capabilities to provide new and valuable offerings for an extended period. For example, we continue to expand the range of clinical services we provide via our HouseCalls initiative.In 2023, we will increase the types of vaccinations offered, expand testing services and deploy even more real-time resources to address social determinants of health. Seniors place high value on being able to get care in their home. It comes with an NPS of 75 and is helping to drive improving retention levels as we head into 2023. In addition, our advocacy service solutions help members achieve better health. Our solutions led to a 42% increase in closing gaps in care, up to 15% lower ER visits and an over 10% increase in clinical program enrollment compared to customers who utilize standard offerings. Turning to health technology, let me offer a few early observations on our progress and long-term growth opportunities we see in this area.With the completed change healthcare combination, we are accelerating our investments to bring this vision of a more intelligent and simpler health system to market as rapidly as possible. We will continue to innovate in and deliver the software, data analytics, technology-enabled services, revenue cycle management and advisory services our customers expect. And we are executing on the synergies of this combination with most of the financial benefit coming from complementary growth. OptumInsight is uniquely positioned to offer integrated, end-to-end technology analytics and services across the entire healthcare value chain. Along these lines, we recently reached two new comprehensive health system partnerships, with Northern Light Health in Maine and with Owensboro Health in Kentucky.The services we provide typically feature a full breadth of our advanced solutions, including information technology, revenue cycle management, analytics and supply chain tools. The key here is that our comprehensive technology solutions are resonating in the market, and we expect to see increasing momentum across all of OptumInsight as we invest in and finalize our integration activities. With that, now I'll turn it over to Chief Financial Officer, John Rex.See also 11 Best Aluminum Stocks To But and 15 Biggest Nursing Home Companies in the US.John Rex: Thank you, Dirk. The investments and innovations Andrew and Dirk described and that we shared with you in November, speak to a company that has tremendous growth potential as we head into '23 and well beyond. The opportunities to serve people more deeply are tangible and accelerating, building upon a foundation of strong growth in recent years, including our 2022 performance. Revenue in '22 of $324 billion grew by more than $36 billion or 13% over the prior year, with well-balanced double-digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Fourth quarter adjusted earnings per share of $5.34 grew 19% and brought full year adjusted earnings per share to $22.19, growth of 17%. Our capital capacities remain strong. Cash flow from operations in '22 was $26.2 billion or 1.3x net income.We returned $13 billion to shareholders through share repurchase and dividends, and deployed over $20 billion in growth capital to expand our capabilities for years to come. Turning to the performance of our businesses. OptumHealth's revenues grew by 32% in '22 to $71 billion as we expanded the number of patients served under value-based care arrangements by about 1 million. Revenue per consumer grew by 29%, driven by the increase in value-based care patients and in the levels of care we are able to offer. Consistent with our comments in November, OptumHealth is off to a strong start in '23 and will organically grow to serve an additional 750,000 value-based patients this year. OptumInsights revenues grew 20% to $14.6 billion in '22. We concluded the year with a revenue backlog of $30 billion, an increase of $7.6 billion over last year.As Dirk noted, we are advancing our investments to more rapidly unlock the positive impact OptumInsight can have for care providers and patients. We expect to make a significant portion of these important investments in the first half of the year. Optum Rx revenues grew 9%, approaching $100 billion for the year, driven by continued strong sales and the expansion of our pharmacy services businesses. Both customer retention and new customer wins were among the highest Optum Rx has ever delivered, laying a strong foundation for continued market-leading growth. At UnitedHealthcare, full year revenues of nearly $250 billion grew 12%. Our strong 2023 Medicare Advantage member outlook is consistent with the objectives we shared with you in November.We expect to serve up to 900,000 more people in '23 across our individual, group and dual special needs offerings, our 8th consecutive year of above-market growth. This consistent performance underscores the product innovation, benefit stability and high-value seniors have come to rely on from us. Our Medicaid growth outlook for '23 incorporates an expectation that states will resume eligibility redeterminations early in the second quarter. Our objective is to ensure that people will have continuous access to benefits. And when all redetermination activities are eventually completed, we expect to serve even more people than we do today across our state-based commercial and exchange-based offerings. Within our commercial offerings, we expect to serve about 1 million additional people in 2023.Our new and innovative products continue to gain momentum with employers and their employees, which will lead to increasing growth in this market over the next several years. In sum, while this year is just getting started, the early performance we are seeing across our businesses further validates our confidence in the 2023 growth and performance objectives we shared with you just six weeks ago. Now I'll turn it back to Andrew.Andrew Witty: Thanks, John. As we head into 2023, we're determined to build upon the momentum we've just described this morning, further advancing our mission and delivering sustainable earnings growth of 13% to 16% over the long term. And with that, operator, let's open it up for questions. One per caller, please.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

However, the season will gather pace this week. This reporting cycle will be important as market participants will closely monitor any sign of earnings, revenues or margin decline.A large section of economists and financial experts are concerned that the U.S. economy may face at least a mild recession in 2023 with a higher interest rate regime and tighter monetary control adopted by the Fed.Nevertheless, five insurers are likely to beat Q4 2022 earnings results. These are - Aflac Inc. AFL, Reinsurance Group of America Inc. RGA, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies Inc. MMC, Unum Group UNM and The Travelers Companies Inc. TRV.Insurance Sector Q4 2022An improving interest rate environment benefits life insurers as their products and investments are rate sensitive. A favorable interest rate thus impacts life insurers' earnings, capital and reserves, liquidity, and competitiveness positively.Insurance brokerage firms are continuously expanding globally, cross-selling products, increasing rates, tightening underwriting standards, and controlling expenses. Growth in the aging population is driving demand for retirement benefit products. The rising population of baby boomers and millennials as well as increasing awareness is boosting demand for medical insurance, life insurance, accidental insurance and other forms of insurance.To maintain competitiveness in the industry, players are embracing technological change. The threat comes from new entrants, including technology companies like insurtechs, start-ups and others. Insurers are focused on using technology and innovation, including artificial intelligence, robotics and blockchain, to simplify and improve client experience, increase efficiencies, alter business models and bring about other disruptive changes in industries in which the existing players operate.Accelerated digitization is also curbing costs, thus aiding margin expansion. It will also help in faster claims processing, thus improving operational performance and retention rate. While investments in technology increase business efficiency, the expenses associated with such investments increase operating costs. At the same time, insurers must shield themselves from falling prey to cyber threats.Story continuesOur Top PicksFive insurance companies are set to beat on fourth quarter earnings results.

Investors might want to try to capture stronger returns by finding positive earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Federal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) earns a Zacks Rank #3 28 days from its next quarterly earnings release on February 13, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $1.57 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $1.57 Most Accurate Estimate and the $1.56 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Federal Realty Investment Trust has an Earnings ESP of 0.18%.FRT is part of a big group of Finance stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Goldman Sachs (GS) as well.Slated to report earnings on January 17, 2023, Goldman Sachs holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $5.31 a share one day from its next quarterly update.For Goldman Sachs, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.25 is 1.23%.Story continuesFRT and GS' positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

A Look At Its Intrinsic Value,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/union-pacific-corporation-nyse-unp-110028409.html,1673953228,STORY,['UNP'],"[Today we'll do a simple run through of a valuation method used to estimate the attractiveness of Union Pacific Corporation (NYSE:UNP) as an investment opportunity by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Union Pacific Step By Step Through The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.32bUS$6.59bUS$7.07bUS$7.18bUS$7.30bUS$7.42bUS$7.55bUS$7.69bUS$7.84bUS$7.99bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 1.59%Est @ 1.71%Est @ 1.79%Est @ 1.85%Est @ 1.89%Est @ 1.91% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.4% US$5.8kUS$5.6kUS$5.5kUS$5.2kUS$4.9kUS$4.6kUS$4.3kUS$4.0kUS$3.8kUS$3.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$47bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$8.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.4%– 2.0%) = US$126bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$126b÷ ( 1 + 8.4%)10= US$56bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$103b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$213, the company appears reasonably expensive at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Union Pacific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.074. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Union PacificStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Transportation industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Transportation market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 4 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price exceeding the intrinsic value?
