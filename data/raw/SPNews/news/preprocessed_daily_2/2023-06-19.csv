Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Ergo, when we looked at the ROCE trends at Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN), we liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Texas Instruments, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.36 = US$9.4b ÷ (US$29b - US$2.9b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).So, Texas Instruments has an ROCE of 36%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Semiconductor industry average of 13%. View our latest analysis for Texas Instruments roceIn the above chart we have measured Texas Instruments' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Texas Instruments' ROCE Trending?In terms of Texas Instruments' history of ROCE, it's quite impressive. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 36% and the business has deployed 68% more capital into its operations. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.The Bottom LineIn the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. And the stock has followed suit returning a meaningful 80% to shareholders over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.Story continuesOne final note, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Texas Instruments (including 1 which is potentially serious) .High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Based on this payment, the dividend yield for the company will be 1.5%, which is fairly typical for the industry. View our latest analysis for Walmart Walmart's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. Based on the last payment, Walmart was quite comfortably earning enough to cover the dividend. This indicates that a lot of the earnings are being reinvested into the business, with the aim of fueling growth.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 83.1% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 30%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendWalmart Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.88 in 2013 to the most recent total annual payment of $2.28. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 1.9% a year over that time. Although we can't deny that the dividend has been remarkably stable in the past, the growth has been pretty muted.Walmart Could Grow Its DividendSome investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. It's encouraging to see that Walmart has been growing its earnings per share at 6.9% a year over the past five years. Earnings are on the uptrend, and it is only paying a small portion of those earnings to shareholders.Walmart Looks Like A Great Dividend StockOverall, we think this could be an attractive income stock, and it is only getting better by paying a higher dividend this year. The company is easily earning enough to cover its dividend payments and it is great to see that these earnings are being translated into cash flow. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity.Story continuesCompanies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach. Still, investors need to consider a host of other factors, apart from dividend payments, when analysing a company.

It had firmed 0.5% against the yuan to 11.70.The rouble weakened around 2% against the dollar last week, blighted by volatile swings in a low liquidity market, eliciting comments on the rouble rate from senior officials, who suggested that an exchange rate of 80-90 per dollar is now preferable.Brent crude oil, a global benchmark for Russia's main export, was down 0.6% at $76.17 a barrel.Despite lower energy prices this morning, the rouble should still win back some of the previous week's losses, said Bogdan Zvarich, chief analyst at Banki.ru.""The main reason for such dynamics may be the expectation of growth in the supply of foreign currency from exporters, who will be preparing for the peak of tax payments this week,"" Zvarich said.Exporters usually convert foreign exchange revenues to pay local liabilities at the end of each month.Trading volumes with the dollar are likely to be lower with U.S. markets closed on Monday for the Juneteenth holiday.Russian stock indexes were mixed.The rouble-based MOEX Russian index was 0.3% lower at 2,793.1 points, having clipped a more than 14-month high in early trade.The dollar-denominated RTS index was up 0.2% to 1,049.1 points.Shares in retailer Magnit were up 1.3%, extending gains from late on Friday when the company announced plans to buy back blocked shares at a 50% discount from foreign shareholders no longer able to trade its Moscow-listed securities.Diamond producer Alrosa's shares climbed 2.3% after a report that the company may pay dividends for the first half of 2023.For Russian equities guide seeFor Russian treasury bonds see(Reporting by Alexander Marrow Editing by Mark Potter)]"

8,072a6795-4ea9-3c0d-bea7-9a22ba0a1b96,O,2023-06-19,Wall Street Turns Bearish As China's Economic Recovery Stalls,Oilprice.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-turns-bearish-chinas-230000443.html,1687129200,STORY,['CL=F'],"[Last December, Beijing announced the most sweeping changes to its strict Covid-19 guidelines, including relaxing testing requirements and travel restrictions. As the world’s largest importer of crude, most commodity experts were optimistic that the country's economy would recover quickly and give a healthy boost to oil demand, with some even touting a swift return to $100 oil.Unfortunately, China’s recovery has been less than impressive, and the initial excitement in the oil markets has been tamped down by a harsher reality. China’s industrial recovery has not been up to par and has fared worse than consumer-facing sectors. The transport sector has also been unimpressive with trucking activity failing to pick up as expected. Jet fuel demand has been disappointing with international flights from China only at 39% of pre-pandemic levels.Immediately after the Covid rules were relaxed, Chinese refiners went on a crude oil buying spree betting on a quick return to downstream demand. But that has failed to materialize leading to onshore inventories climbing to a two-year high.The current economic outlook is not good, either. Bloomberg has reported that China’s credit demand weakened in May as the economy’s recovery lost steam. Aggregate financing fell to 1.6 trillion yuan ($224 billion) in May, considerably lower than the median estimate of 1.9 trillion yuan.Aggregate financing, a broad measure of credit, was 1.6 trillion yuan ($224 billion) in May, the People’s Bank of China said Tuesday, lower than the median estimate of 1.9 trillion yuan. Other economic data points also point to a slowing economy: inflation remained close to zero, exports contracted for the first time in three months, manufacturing activity also contracted and a rebound in home sales slowed. Meanwhile, private investment in the first four months of the year came to a halt despite a rapid expansion in money supply.Story continuesBeijing is now considering deploying a broad package of stimulus measures in a bid to boost the economy. Last week, PBOC Governor Yi Gang hinted at more flexibility in monetary policy, including “counter-cyclical adjustments” that will support the economy, with some analysts saying this signals more easing.Wall Street Growing Bearish On OilWhether these measures will work as intended and help boost the sputtering economy remains to be seen. Unfortunately, Wall Street is growing increasingly bearish about the oil price outlook. Last week, Goldman Sachs' oil ultrabull Jeff Currie once again lowered his Brent forecast for December, this time to $86 a barrel from $95 and $100 before that. Currie cited increasing supply from Russia, Iran and Venezuela; growing recession fears and persistent headwinds to higher prices from higher interest rates for his growing bearishness.Analysts at Citi are also quite bearish, recently saying the Saudi cuts are unlikely to sustain a gain into the high $80s or low $90s thanks to lackluster demand and stronger non-OPEC supply by year-end.However, the oil markets have received some reprieve after the Fed’s decision to pause interest rate hikes. At 9:50 a.m. EST, WTI was trading up 1.2% at $69.34, for a $1.02 gain on the day while Brent crude was trading up 1.57% at $74.36, for a $1.16 gain on the day. The gains have been rather muted after the Fed signaled another half percentage point increase in interest rates by the end of this year. China’s disappointing economic outlook is also giving the bulls a pause.Overall, oil markets have become highly volatile in the current week as traders try to make sense of a mix of both bullish and bearish drivers. Oil prices rallied mid-week  after the latest EIA report showed crude refining has hit the highest level since August 2019 in anticipation of strong summer demand. However, the same report revealed that U.S. crude production has hit the highest levels since April 2020 while crude exports have declined.However, crude oil inventories at the WTI pricing hub at Cushing, Oklahoma, rose for the seventh consecutive week and are currently close to the five-year average. The w/w crude oil balance shows unusually large swings in exports and imports. However, the most bearish piece of news came outside the U.S. market with reports that Iran might soon officially resume oil exports with nuclear talks with the U.S. progressing at a faster-than-expected clip.""Oil prices are caught in a clash between two opposing forces, bearish asset allocators who point to monetary contraction and bullish oil speculators expecting lower inventories in 2H23. The bearish allocators will maintain the upper hand for now, as oil prices struggle to rally until the Fed eases money supply,"" Bank of America Global Research's Francisco Blanch said in a note.By Alex Kimani for Oilprice.comMore Top Reads From Oilprice.com:New Truck Orders Defy Troubled Freight MarketScientists Leap Forward In Sustainable Hydrogen ProductionTax Incentives To Supercharge U.S. Clean Energy TransitionRead this article on OilPrice.com]"

Both contracts rose more than 2% each last week.China growth concerns in play ahead of loan prime rate cutWhile refineries in China processed their highest amount of crude in years through May, concerns still persisted over a slowing economic rebound in the country, which could keep fuel consumption limited and bring down overall crude demand.Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) became the latest major investment bank to trim its annual growth forecast for China, stating that current levels of stimulus in the world’s largest oil importer will be insufficient in supporting an economic recovery.The cut follows a string of weak economic indicators from the country for April and May, and pointed to a slowing rebound despite the lifting of anti-COVID measures.China is now expected to cut its key loan prime rate on Tuesday after trimming short and medium-term rates last week, as Beijing struggles to support economic growth. The rate cuts had provided some support to oil prices.But oil markets were also disheartened by little progress in talks between top U.S. and Chinese officials over potentially cooling tensions between the world’s largest economies.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken met Chinese Foreign Minister Qin Gang over the weekend, the first meeting of senior U.S.-Chinese officials in five years.

Based on the last payment, Flowserve's earnings were much higher than the dividend, but it wasn't converting those earnings into cash flow. In general, we consider cash flow to be more important than earnings, so we would be cautious about relying on the sustainability of this dividend.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 43.4%.

(AP) — A jury verdict that found an Oregon power company liable for devastating wildfires — and potentially billions of dollars in damages — is highlighting the legal and financial risks utilities take if they fail to take proper precautions in a hotter, drier climate.Utilities, especially in the U.S. West, are increasingly finding themselves in a financial bind that’s partly of their own making, experts say. While updating, replacing and even burying thousands of miles of power lines is a time-consuming and costly undertaking, the failure to start that work in earnest years ago has put them on the back foot as wildfires have grown more destructive — and lawsuits over electrical equipment sparking blazes have ballooned.“How do they pay for that and at the same time try to do grid hardening at a pace that could prevent the need for constant shutting down of the power?” Josh Hacker, chief science officer at Jupiter Intelligence, a company that provides advice on managing climate change risks, said of lawsuit damages. “This is an enormous challenge. Now it’s biting them. And in the end it’s going to bite all of us, because they have to recover that expense.”Last week, a jury in Oregon found PacifiCorp liable for damages for negligently failing to cut power to its 600,000 customers during a windstorm over Labor Day weekend, despite warnings from top fire officials, and for its power lines being responsible for multiple blazes.PacifiCorp said it was disappointed with the jury's decision and that it plans to appeal.The fires were among the worst natural disasters in Oregon’s history. They killed nine people, burned more than 1,875 square miles (4,856 square kilometers) and destroyed upward of 5,000 homes and other structures. While total damages remain to be determined, they are expected to reach into the billions.Because utilities make money from customers, they often raise revenue for infrastructure upgrades by hiking rates. In California, for example, Pacific Gas and Electric has requested to increase its rates for residential customers this year by roughly 18%, partly to bury more than 3,000 miles (4,828 kilometers) of overhead power lines underground, according to a fact sheet from the state’s public utilities commission. The commission, which regulates utility rates, said it expects to make a final decision on the request between July and September.Story continuesPG&amp;E’s planned upgrades come amid heightened scrutiny of the utility, which serves more than 16 million people over 70,000 square miles (181,300 square kilometers) in central and northern California. Facing billions of dollars in damages stemming from multiple blazes, it filed for bankruptcy in 2019, shortly after its neglected equipment caused a fire that virtually razed the town of Paradise in the Sierra Nevada foothills in 2018. The Camp Fire was the deadliest and most destructive fire in California’s history.PG&amp;E’s bankruptcy settlement with wildfire victims was an eye-popping $13.5 billion. Only half of the money was paid to victims in cash, while the other half was paid out in PG&amp;E stock, which has since declined in value.PacifiCorp, meanwhile, says it has invested hundreds of millions of dollars since the Labor Day 2020 fires in Oregon in upgrading its equipment and expanding its weather stations and weather modeling. But customers are also helping fund those investments. Oregon’s public utility commission approved rate increases for PacifiCorp in 2023 in part so that the utility could cover “non-energy costs,” including wildfire mitigation and vegetation management.After the verdicts were handed down, PacifiCorp filed a request with Oregon's public utility commission asking to potentially defer the costs linked to the lawsuit. The jury awarded around $90 million to 17 homeowners named as plaintiffs in the case, with damages to be determined later for a broader class that could include the owners of about 2,500 properties, as estimated by plaintiffs’ attorneys.In its filing, PacifiCorp said the application would enable it “to preserve its ability to seek recovery in the future"" in case potential future class-action damages “impact the financial stability of the company."" Such a move ""would result in higher costs to customers,” the filing said.However, the company requested that the commission delay its consideration of the application until the costs of its wildfire-related claims are more fully known. Oregon's public utility commission would have to approve the request.“The PUC recognizes the controversy that surrounds this filing,” Kandi Young, the commission's spokesperson, said in an email. “When the time comes to take action, the PUC will establish an open and transparent public process in which all interested persons have the opportunity to present information and argument to the Commission, including PUC Staff, ratepayer advocates, PacifiCorp, other participants, and members of the public.”The revenue model of utilities — and the way some have settled previous wildfire claims — have raised questions about the extent to which such companies are truly being held accountable for their role in sparking wildfires.“Where is public safety and the durability of the entire system in the priorities of what are basically profit-making enterprises? That is the big question that is being addressed here,” said Scott McNutt, a part-time lecturer in bankruptcy law at the University of California, Davis, who also worked as counsel to the fee examiner in the PG&amp;E bankruptcy case.Utilities, meanwhile, say the growing risk of wildfires to public safety is being driven by forces beyond their control, such as climate change and population growth in the wildland-urban interface — the boundary where development encroaches on natural areas.“These systemic issues affect all Oregonians and are larger than any single utility,” PacifiCorp said in a statement earlier this week after the jury handed down one of its verdicts.Some experts agree to a certain extent, saying that hardening the electrical grid is just one of many critical steps that must be taken to protect people and their homes from wildfires.“Power companies ... should always be working to reduce any potential ignition risk,” said Michael Gollner, associate professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley. “But you also want to make it so that if there are those fires, those fires aren’t going to cause death and destruction.”Changing the materials that homes are built with, Gollner said, is one way communities can protect themselves from wildfires. Having fire-retardant roofs made of asphalt or tile instead of wood, covering vents with fine mesh to keep embers out, and having nonflammable siding can help prevent homes from burning down. Creating what’s known as a “defensible space” around one’s home — a buffer area where there is less vegetation, helping to slow down a fire’s progress — is also key. Prescribed burns and thinning out fuels in forests are important as well, he said.“We haven’t taken a more holistic step to harden our communities so they don’t invite in fires,” he said. “We haven’t done the hard, other work.""]"

Start your 7-day trial to get on board.Federal court temporarily halts Microsoft-Activision buyoutA federal court in California ruled in favor of a request from U.S. antitrust regulators to place a temporary block on the completion of Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) $69 billion merger with Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:ATVI).The Federal Trade Commission has argued that the deal, the largest ever in the video games industry, would grant Microsoft the ability and a heightened incentive to restrict Activision's content in ways that significantly reduce competition - a viewpoint that the two companies disagree with.In early December, the FTC, responsible for enforcing antitrust law, had already approached an in-house administrative judge to block the transaction on antitrust grounds. Their contention was that it would grant Microsoft's Xbox exclusive access to Activision games, leaving Nintendo consoles and Sony's (NYSE:SONY) PlayStation at a disadvantage.Despite the news, Microsoft shares were up 5.5% for the week; Activision ticked up fractionally.Broadcom/VMware $61B deal likely receives EU approval VMware (NYSE:VMW) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares surged 4% and 6% last Monday after Reuters reported that Broadcom is likely to receive conditional approval from the EU antitrust authority for its planned purchase of VMware, citing sources familiar with the matter.The approval from the European Commission is contingent upon Broadcom implementing measures to ensure interoperability with competitors, sources said.Both Broadcom and the EU antitrust watchdog declined to provide any comments on the matter.Story continuesiRobot stock jumps 21% after UK CMA approves Amazon’s acquisition The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) approved Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) $1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT), after which iRobot shares jumped more than 21% on Friday.After an investigation, the CMA has determined that the deal does not raise competition concerns in the U.K. However, the acquisition is still under review by regulators in other jurisdictions.

To skip our detailed analysis, head directly to the 10 Largest Economies in the World in 2023.Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the market value of all finished goods and services produced in a country within a specific time period. The GDP can help gauge the health and size of a country’s economy. The world’s total output was estimated to be above $100 trillion in 2022. A report by the United Nations has projected global GDP to grow at 2.3% in 2023 and 2.5% in 2024. Prospects of economic recovery from the effects of Covid-19 pandemic remain dim amid rising interest rates, high inflation, and global uncertainties. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has further complicated matters.The United States is the largest economy in the world, which is expected to grow by 1.1% in 2023. China’s GDP growth is forecasted at 5.3%, while Europe’s economies are projected to grow by a mere 0.9% this year.A report released by the McKinsey Global Institute highlighted the impact of corporations on the global economy in the 21st century. It was found that the business sector contributed 72% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in OECD member nations. Companies that have more than $1 billion in annual revenue contribute the major chunk in that percentage. In 2017, about $14 trillion of the United States’ then GDP of $20 trillion was coming from the corporate sector. Cargill, which is the largest privately held corporation in the U.S., had a revenue of $165 billion in 2022 – a staggering amount that is greater than the GDP of some entire nations. Publicly listed companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) also play a significant role in retaining the U.S.’s status of the largest economy in the world.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) recorded a revenue of $394 billion in 2022. Earlier this year in March, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported a 9% increase in profits for the first quarter of 2023 - $18.3 billion, or $2.45 per share. In the defense sector, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is the largest defense contractor in the world that produces billions of dollars worth military equipment for countries around the world. You can read more on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023.Story continuesThe last couple of decades, however, have witnessed the beginning of a radical shift in global economic power from advanced countries towards emerging markets. Economic growth in the developing and emerging countries has been 5.8%, on average, since the year 2000, which is considerably higher than the mean 1.8% seen in the advanced nations during the same period. Economies of the Emerging 7, or E7 countries, were half the size of the G7 countries in 1995, and in 2015, both groups were relatively the same size. By 2040, the E7 economies are expected to be twice the size of G7. This is discussed in detail in our article, the 25 Most Powerful Countries in the World in 2023.Asian CenturyThe 21st century has also been dubbed by economic experts as the Asian Century. China and India are already among the top five largest economies in the world. China is the second largest economy in the world after the United States. India now boasts an economy nearing $4 trillion and hosts global tech giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Twitter that employ thousands. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), Asia, which is home to nearly half of the world’s population, is likely to generate more than 50% of the world’s GDP by 2040. The continent accounts for nearly one-third of the world’s total trade, up from about a quarter a decade ago. China and India have been forecasted by the PwC to become the two largest economies of the world in 2050, going past the United States. European Union’s share of the global GDP is likely to reduce to a mere 9%, with France expected to be out of the top 10, and Italy out of the top 20 largest economies in the world. Indonesia is also projected to be among the top seven largest economies of the world in 2050. Vietnam and Philippines are expected to take strides as well in the coming decades. Pakistan may become the sixth largest economic power by 2075, according to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS).MethodologyWe have used nominal GDPs of countries to rank the 50 largest economies in the world in 2023. Data has been sourced from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The GDP numbers are from 2022.Here are the largest economies in the world in 2023:50 Largest Economies in the World in 2023dibrova/Shutterstock.com50. PortugalGDP: $252 billionWe begin our list with Portugal, a southern European country that borders Spain. The country’s economy has bounced back from the pandemic-induced recession. The growth has been driven by strong domestic demand and resumption of tourism in the country. Portugal’s GDP is expected to grow by 2.4% in 2023.49. IraqGDP: $270 billionIraq recorded a GDP growth of 8% in 2022. One of the main reasons for this was the country's 12% increase in oil output, as noted by IMF, and high oil prices around the world, which provided much needed respite to the Iraqi economy.48. FinlandGDP: $281 billionFinland had a GDP of $281 billion in 2022. The country's 60% of exports are to members of the European Union, with Germany and Sweden being its largest trade partners. Finland experienced a mild recession in 2022, because of which, economic growth is expected to remain low in the first half of 2023.47. Czech RepublicGDP: $290 billionCzech Republic made the list of the largest economies in the world in 2023 due to the size of its GDP, which was measured at $290 billion in 2022. Economic growth, however, is expected to decline, from 2.5% in 2022 to 0.2% in 2023. Inflation is expected to decelerate from 14.6% in 2022 to 11.9% in 2023. It is also one of the 20 largest economies in Europe.46. ChileGDP: $301 billionChile had a GDP of $301 billion and a growth rate of 2.4% in 2022. The economy is expected to grow slightly in 2023, driven by exports, especially lithium and copper.

RomaniaGDP: $302 billionRomania had a robust GDP growth of 4.2% in 2022, with the size of its economy measured at $302 billion by the IMF. This was driven by increased investments and private consumption. The country has a GDP per capita of $14,643. More than 1,800 Romanians work for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). In 2022, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced to open its first data center in Romania.44. ColombiaGDP $344 billionColombia’s economy grew at 7.3% in 2022 but has overheated due to activity beyond its potential, said the World Bank. It is projected to slow down and grow by a mere 1.7% in 2023. However, growth is expected to increase to 2% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2025. Crude petroleum, coal, and coffee are the country’s main exports.43. IranGDP: $352 billion Despite economic sanctions and an inflation rate of 42.5%, Iran’s economy is projected to grow by 2.2% in 2023. However long-term prospects of the economy look gloomy with no revival of a nuclear deal in sight.42. Hong KongGDP: $361 billionHong Kong’s economy shrank by 4.1% in the last three quarters of 2022, but has staged a recovery in 2023, driven by an increase in tourism and local spending. The government’s GDP growth forecast for 2023 is between 3.5-5%, and Hong Kong is well on track to achieve it.41. PakistanGDP: $376 billionPakistan is the fifth most populous nation in the world, with its youth bulge being the driving force of the economy. However, security and political turmoil in the last decade has pegged the country back from reaching its full potential. In 2023, Pakistan risks facing default with its foreign exchange reserves critically low and revenues shrinking. You can read more on it in our list of the top companies in Pakistan.40. DenmarkGDP: $391 billionDenmark received a ‘stable’ outlook from Fitch and was forecast to narrowly avoid technical recession in 2023. The OECD has projected a growth rate of 0.1% this year and for inflation to fall from 8% to under 3% by 2024. It has also been regarded as one of the best countries to start a business, owing to its relatively low corporate tax rate of 22%. In addition, Copenhagen is considered the logistics hub in the Nordic region, providing access to 100 million Scandinavian customers within 24 hours. For this reason, the country attracts a lot of shipping businesses catering to Nordic countries.39. PhilippinesGDP: $404 billionPhilippines is on track to become an upper middle-income economy, according to the country director for Asian Development Bank (ADB). Its economy is expected to grow 6% in 2023 and climb further by 6.2% in 2024. PwC’s report titled ‘The World in 2050’ has projected that Philippines will be among the 20 largest economies in the world by 2050.38. South AfricaGDP: $406 billionScheduled power cuts that started in 2007 have constrained South Africa’s economic growth. This has disrupted economic activity by increasing operating costs for businesses. The Covid-19 pandemic further exacerbated the country’s woes. According to the World Bank, there were half a million fewer jobs in 2022 than in 2019. Despite these challenges, South Africa remains an economic power in the African continent.37. VietnamGDP: $407 billionVietnam’s GDP grew by 8% in 2022. That has slowed down in 2023 to 3.3% in the first quarter. This is due to the ongoing recession in the European Union and the United States – two key trade partners that account for 40% of Vietnam’s exports, according to S&amp;P Global. However, Vietnam is expected to resume rapid economic growth as it remains a key southeast Asian manufacturing hub.36. MalaysiaGDP: $408 billionThe Malaysian economy continues to thrive and recorded a GDP growth of 5.6% in the first quarter of 2023, which was higher than some of the other prominent countries in the neighborhood, such as Indonesia, China, and Vietnam. Malaysia’s GDP is projected to rise from $408 billion in 2022 to $780 billion by 2032 – an increase of 90% in a decade.35. BangladeshGDP: $460 billionBangladesh’s economy is expected to grow by 5.3% in 2023, which is the third highest growth rate among South Asian countries after Maldives and India. In 2021, the country surpassed India on per capita income, and has an 80% higher per capita GDP than Pakistan – the country it took independence from in 1971.34. SingaporeGDP: $467 billionSingapore is a high-income economy and boasts a gross national income per capita of over $64,000 according to the World Bank. Singapore is a major international financial hub, and its currency, the Singapore Dollar, is among the 15 Most Powerful Currencies in the World – accounting for nearly 1.8% of all foreign exchange trading daily. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) has announced building a forex trading hub in Singapore in collaboration with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM).33. AustriaGDP: $472 billionStrong domestic demand is likely to help Austria recover from its current economic downturn. According to the OECD, Austria’s GDP growth is expected to be 0.2% in 2023, and then 1.6% in 2024. Economic forecasts suggest real wages to rise and inflation to ease in the ongoing fiscal year.32. EgyptGDP: $475 billionEgypt had a GDP of $475 billion in 2022 with an economic growth of 6.6%. However, this growth is expected to decline in 2023 to 4.5% according to the World Bank.

ArgentinaGDP: $632 billionArgentina is the third largest economy in South America behind Brazil and Mexico but is going through one of the worst economic crises in its history. Annual inflation rate soared past 100% in April 2023 – the third highest in the world after Venezuela and Zimbabwe. The country’s central bank has hiked interest rates to 97% with the hope that this measure will incentivize investments in the local currency.22. PolandGDP: $688 billionPoland has been one of the most affected countries due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine because of a large influx of refugees and increased energy prices, which have taken a toll on the Polish economy and dimmed hopes of a post-pandemic recovery. Poland’s GDP growth has crashed from 5.1% in 2022 to a projection of 0.7% in 2023. However, EU forecasts expect economic growth to rebound in 2024 to 2.7%.21.

TürkiyeGDP: $906 billionWith an output of over $900 billion, Türkiye’s economy is the 19th largest in the world in terms of nominal GDP. The country is a member of the G20 and OECD. Despite the fact that the Turkish Lira has lost 60% of its value against the U.S. Dollar since 2021, the Turkish economy remains strong and grew by 5.2% in 2022. However, the devastating earthquakes that occurred this year inflicted direct losses exceeding $34 billion, adding pressures to the country’s macro-financial situation.18. NetherlandsGDP: $994 billionNetherlands’ economy is close to touching $1 trillion. Despite having a population of only 17 million, it is one of Europe’s strongest economies. Dutch multinational company Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG), or Philips, is headquartered in Amsterdam.

Investors are confident of a rebound soon because the Spanish economy has not been hit as badly as some other European nations from Russia’s war on Ukraine. This is due to Madrid’s focus on specialized production and less reliance on the Ukrainian and Russian economies.14. MexicoGDP: $1.41 trillion Mexico is tipped to be seventh largest economy in the world in 2050 by PwC. The South American nation currently boasts a GDP nearing $1.5 trillion.

Despite challenges, it is one of the world’s largest economies, and its currency, the Australian Dollar, is the premiere currency of the Asia-Pacific region. 11. BrazilGDP: $1.92 trillionBrazil ranks 11th in our list of the 50 largest economies in the world in 2023. The size of the Brazilian economy is closing in on the $2 trillion mark.

Better, the recent market turbulence has pushed some stocks to lower levels, presenting an opportune time to acquire them at discounted prices. Of course, among the group of overlooked stocks with potential, many investors focus on are value traps. Or, companies that appear cheap, or attractive, based on where they previously traded. However, for various fundamental or accurate reasons, such stocks often continue lower as investors look to other alternatives in given sectors.That said, there are certain companies I’d put in the overlooked stocks with potential bucket, particularly in sectors that haven’t benefited as much from certain growth trends such as AI right now. Here are three such overlooked stocks I think are worth considering right now.PAYXPaychex$113.09INTUIntuit$446.12WDAYWorkday$209.65InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPaychex (PAYX)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comPaychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) is a software company specializing in HR services. Their offerings include payroll management, benefits administration, insurance services, and compliance support for businesses.In addition, Paychex will increase its quarterly dividend by 13% to 89 cents per share, starting with the May 2023 payment. This move will result in a $1.2 billion dividend payout to shareholders for fiscal year 2023. The company refrains from buying back its stock unless it’s for dilution purposes, with $327.1 million remaining for repurchase from its $400 million authorization.While PAYX stock has declined along with the broader market, there are factors to consider. For one, despite concerns of an economic slowdown, employment remains robust, with the U.S. unemployment rate at a low 3.5%. Two, labor demand remains high, and a temporary dip in economic output is unlikely to significantly impact the country’s favorable employment outlook. And three, the current price of PAYX presents an opportunity with a 2.8% dividend yield.Story continuesIntuit (INTU)Man holding stacks of money. Unknown Millionaire-Maker StocksSource: Epic Cure / ShutterstockNext up, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) is a top player in financial software and services, known for TurboTax and QuickBooks. TurboTax is widely favored by U.S. consumers for tax preparation, while QuickBooks assists small businesses and self-employed individuals in managing income and expenses. With over 70% market share in both categories, Intuit maintains a dominant position.Even better, Intuit expands its customer connections by providing additional services alongside its core products. Small businesses can benefit from Intuit’s payroll, payment processing, and marketing software, for example. This widens Intuit’s addressable market, estimated at $253 billion. In addition, while the company is facing increased competition in these sectors, Intuit’s established dominance in tax preparation and accounting software creates the potential for upselling to its existing user base.Also, with substantial investments in artificial intelligence, the company revealed during its fiscal Q3 2023 earnings call that its platforms, such as Mailchimp and Credit Karma, generate a staggering 58 billion machine learning predictions each day. This AI integration enables Mailchimp users to enhance their email marketing campaigns and empowers Credit Karma to provide tailored credit strategies and product recommendations to users monitoring their credit ratings.Workday (WDAY)Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) is a leading cloud-based software provider, offering businesses innovative solutions for human capital management, financial management, and analytics. In fact, the company’s cutting-edge cloud software empowers organizations to enhance workforce management, streamline financial processes, and make informed decisions.In addition, Workday serves a significant number of Fortune 500 clients and recently surpassed 10,000 customers in Q4 2023. Also, with a 19.6% year-over-year revenue increase and a non-GAAP basic net income per share of $1.00, Workday expects a 20% CAGR with projected FY2024 revenue of $6.5 billion. Also, the company recognizes a substantial market opportunity, estimating HCM and finance sectors at $52 billion and $73 billion respectively. As organizations continue to modernize their HR and finance operations, Workday remains a top SaaS stock choice.Despite macroeconomic uncertainty, Workday remains confident in its position as a preferred provider of finance and HR software for companies driving digital transformation. Here, too, the company’s investments in artificial intelligence and machine learning will further enhance its offerings and market presence when economic conditions improve.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

That’s roughly the perspective of Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson, who has not been a fan of bidding up what could be a potentially overheated market.Instead, Wilson believes that for those that wish to stay in the equities sector, investors should focus on securities with defensive characteristics, operational efficiency, and earnings stability. For this list of bargain stocks in a hot market, that’s exactly what I’m offering with the below ideas.Specifically, I filtered out publicly traded companies for their Piotroski F-Score, which considers profitability, leverage (liquidity), and operating efficiency. Generally speaking, a score between 7 through 9 indicates good value. On that note, below are the top-value stocks in a bull market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCigna (CI)Cigna logo displayed on a modern smartphone. CI stock.Source: Piotr Swat / ShutterstockA global health service company, Cigna (NYSE:CI) ranks among the best undervalued stocks to buy thanks to its secular relevancy. Historically, the healthcare segment offers several ideas for defensive play since the demand for it remains reasonably stable irrespective of market cycles. However, the market doesn’t see it that way, with CI stock losing over 17% of its equity value. For astute investors, though, this fallout could be an upside opportunity.According to data from investment resource Gurufocus, the market prices Cigna shares at a forward multiple of 10.81. As a discount to projected earnings, Cigna ranks better than 66.67% of sector rivals. Moreover, CI trades at a trailing multiple of 12.12. In contrast, the sector median value stands at 21.71 times. As well, CI ranks among the bargain stocks in the hot market thanks to its Piotroski F-Score of 8. This stat suggests high operating efficiency, an implication confirmed by Cigna’s return on equity (ROE) of 14.91% (above 68.42% of competitors).Story continuesArcher Daniels Midland (ADM)BSFC Stock. Healthy food including salmon, almonds, garlic, broccoli, avocado, and lettuceSource: Shutterstock.comAt the most basic level, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) makes a great case for the best undervalued stocks to buy under present conditions thanks to overriding relevance. As a multinational food processing and commodities trading firm, Archer Daniels essentially enjoys a permanently relevant profile. However, the market has other ideas, sending ADM lower by slightly over 19% on a year-to-date basis.Such red ink might be overdoing it. Either way, ADM on paper represents one of the value stocks in a bull market. Specifically, the market prices ADM at a forward multiple of 10.44. As a discount to projected earnings, Archer Daniels ranks better than 81.25% of companies listed in the consumer packaged goods industry. Also, ADM features a price-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.56, far lower than the sector median of 1.7 times.According to Gurufocus, Archer Daniels features a Piotroski F-Score of 7, which is a solid rating. Helping to confirm Archer’s efficiency is the company’s ROE, which comes in at 18.37%. This stat ranks better than 85% of its peers, making ADM one of the undervalued stocks to buy.ICL Group (ICL)A tractor spreading fertilizer over a farm field.Source: Fotokostic / Shutterstock.comA company thrust into cynical relevance due to geopolitical flashpoints, ICL Group (NYSE:ICL) is a multinational manufacturing company. Primarily, the entity develops produces, and markets fertilizers, metals, and other special-purpose chemical products, per its public profile. With global food crises becoming a prominent risk factor, ICL is one of the unignorable entities among the best undervalued stocks.As with the other enterprises on this list, the market doesn’t see it that way (for now). Since the Jan. opener, shares plunged slightly over 24%. Nevertheless, recent trades suggest a turnaround might be in order. Either way, because of the fallout, ICL trades at a trailing multiple of 3.95, according to Fintel. That matches up with info from Gurufocus, making ICL significantly undervalued.In addition, ICL also prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 23.6% (on a per-share basis), beating out 69.3% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period impresses at 50.5%. Overall, ICL’s Piotroski F-Score lands at 9 out of 9. You really can’t get better than that.Murphy USA (MUSA)A photo of a row of gasoline pump handles at a pump with the sun shining on them. Gas prices dropping.Source: ThePowerPlant/ShutterStock.comAs an operator of a chain of discount retail gasoline stations, Murphy USA (NYSE:MUSA) ranks among the best undervalued stocks because of its everyday utility. True, economic conditions might impact fuel demand. However, people still need to get around. Additionally, with companies beginning to recall their workers back to the office in earnest, MUSA might become a cynical beneficiary.Plus, on paper, Murphy USA ranks as one of the high potential undervalued stocks. Mainly, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 30.5%, beating out 88.87% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period impresses at a sterling 56.9%. Despite this outperformance, MUSA trades at a trailing sales multiple of 0.28. As a discount to revenue, the company ranks better than 75.84% of the competition.Notably, the company’s Piotroski F-Score lands at 7 out of 9, which is a decent score. Just as well, Murphy’s ROE pings at 85.22%, outflanking 97% of its peers. Thus, it’s a great idea for bargain stocks in a hot market.Integra Lifesciences (IART)surgeons operating on a patientSource: Dmytro Zinkevych / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Princeton, New Jersey, Integra Lifesciences (NASDAQ:IART) is a global leader in regenerative tissue technologies and neurosurgical solutions dedicated to limiting uncertainty for clinicians. As an advanced medical technology firm, Integra enjoys relevance in any market cycle. However, IART is one of the riskiest ideas on this list of value stocks in a bull market, shedding 27% YTD.Still, for those that don’t mind ramping up their risk-reward profile, IART could be intriguing. First, Gurufocus labels Integra as significantly undervalued. Most noticeably, the market prices IART at a forward multiple of 12.79. As a discount to projected earnings, Integra ranks better than 96.94% of companies listed in the medical devices sector.Second, the company’s Piotroski F-Score stands at 9 out of 9, indicating superior operational efficiency. In addition, Integra’s ROE comes in at 10.13%, ranked better than 73.26% of its peers. As such, it’s one of the best undervalued stocks for speculators.Photronics (PLAB)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockAs a technology firm, Photronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) might not seem an ideal play among the best undervalued stocks. Moreover, tech plays usually tend to be cyclical, which wouldn’t be ideal as a defensive proposition. However, Photronics’ semiconductor photomask provider business offers myriad applications and broad utility. As a result, shares skyrocketed over 36% since the beginning of this year.Despite the strong performance in the charts, PLAB makes a compelling case for value stocks in a bull market. For instance, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 19.2%, above 68.43% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same frame clocks in at 38.7%, above 72.27%. Nevertheless, PLAB still trades at a trailing sales multiple of 1.61, below the sector median of 2.72 times.Lastly, Photronics benefits from a Piotroski F-Score of 8 out of 9. Combined with an ROE of 14% (ranked above 70.32% of sector players), PLAB makes for an intriguing case for undervalued stocks to buy.TD Synnex (SNX)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing. cheap tech stocksSource: Peshkova / ShutterstockAnother tech enterprise, TD Synnex (NYSE:SNX) is a Fortune 200 company, according to its public profile. It’s a leading provider of a comprehensive range of distribution, systems design, and integration services for the technology industry to a wide range of enterprises. Thanks to its broad footprint, SNX makes for an enticing case for the best undervalued stocks. Since the January opener, shares slipped nearly 4%.Nevertheless, the red ink might offer an attractive entry point for astute contrarians. Currently, the market prices SNX at a forward multiple of 8.01. As a discount to projected earnings, TD Synnex ranks better than 91.53% of sector rivals. Operationally, the company posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 20.4%, beating out 86.9% of its peers. Despite this outperformance, SNX trades at only 0.14 times trailing sales, well below the sector median of 1.36 times. On a final note, TD Synnex’s Piotroski F-Score clocks in at 7 out of 9. At the same time, its ROE pings at 8.59%, beating out 60.57% of other competitors.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

22,c673b9b9-ffc5-3a6e-89a9-131aaa815ba8,SNPS,2023-06-19,Get Out Now! 3 Tech Stocks That Are Poised to Plunge,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-3-tech-stocks-poised-130038899.html,1686574838,STORY,"['NVDA', 'FICO', '^GSPC', 'SNPS']","[It’s hard to believe, less than halfway into 2023 that investors are talking about tech stocks poised to plunge. That’s right; Wall Street is getting nervous about the tech rally we’re currently enjoying. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) chief global markets strategist Marco Kolanovic appeared on a CNBC interview on June 7, suggesting that tech stocks have gone too far. “It’s hard to say that it cannot go more, but we think it’s in a little bit of a bubble domain already,” Insider.com reported the strategist’s comments from the interview.According to Yardeni Research, the S&amp;P 500 tech sector is up 32.7% year-to-date through June 7, tied with communication services for the top-performing sectors in the index. Semiconductors, technology hardware, storage and peripherals, and systems software are the top three tech sub-sectors. They’re up by 61.4%, 35.9%, and 34.2% respectively.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsI have a simple method to choose three overvalued tech stocks to sell. I’ll select one from each of the top-performing sub-sectors. Yardeni says the average forward price-to-earnings ratio of the S&amp;P 500 tech sector is 25.7x. This is up from around 18x at the year’s start. So, I’ll choose three stocks with a forward P/E in the late 20s or 30s.Nvidia (NVDA)Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware and softwareSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.comNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the top-performing S&amp;P 500 tech stock in 2023. It’s up 170% YTD and 107% over the past year. According to Finviz.com, that puts it first or second out of 74 index stocks.Now, I wouldn’t go so far as to say its shares will plunge — I believe CEO Jensen Huang is one of America’s most brilliant minds — but its stock has come a long way in a short time.In late April, when Nvidia was trading at around $277, I said it was a stock to buy before it became the next trillion-dollar company. That’s a 40% gain in less than six weeks. I’ll take that every day and twice on Sundays. It wasn’t hard to see that Nvidia’s focus on artificial intelligence (AI) would benefit its long-term growth. However, the share price was helped by unbelievably optimistic Q3 2024 revenue guidance of $11 billion, $3.8 billion higher than the analyst estimate.    Story continues“For any investor calling this an AI bubble… we would point them to this Nvidia quarter and especially guidance which cements our bullish thesis around AI and speaks to the 4th Industrial Revolution now on the doorstep with AI,” Fortune reported Wedbush analyst Dan Ives’ comments in late May.Nvidia’s stock may fall back to the low $300s by the end of the summer. That would be a 20-25% correction. This makes it one of those tech stocks poised to plunge. Long-term, however, the 49 analysts covering its stock have a median target price of $455. Even with a pullback, I could see NVDA blowing through that by the first half of 2024.Fair Isaac (FICO)Graphic of skull on computer hardware with red glow beneath hardware. Tech stocks to sellSource: shutterstock.com/solarsevenWhenever I see the stock symbol FICO, I think of my credit score. While that’s part of Fair Isaac (NASDAQ:FICO), it has become a data analytics company through its FICO platform used by consumers and businesses worldwide.In the quarter ended March 31, the company had revenue of $380.3 million, 6.5% higher than $357.2 million a year ago. The company has two reportable segments: Scores (52% of revenue) and Software (48%).The Scores segment caters to both B2B and B2C. It divides its $198.5 million revenue into 73% for B2B and 27% for B2C. The Software segment, incorporating the FICO platform, separates its income between on-premise and SaaS. These account for 85% of the $181.8 million Q2 2023 revenue. The remaining 15% comes from professional services.Clearly, it has three substantial revenue streams. Both segments yield solid operating margins. Yet, the sales growth is not extraordinary. The Scores segment saw an 8.1% revenue increase in the second quarter. The Software segment, on the other hand, had a 4.8% rise year-over-year.Yet, it trades at 33.2x its forward earnings and 13.6x sales, 33.2x its forward earnings, and 13.6x sales, which are much higher than their historical norms. This means the company is one of those tech stocks that are poised to plunge. FICO stock is up nearly 30% YTD and 358% over the past year. The shares are trading within $35 of their all-time high.  The business is good, but the stock is due for a 10-20% correction before the end of 2023. Synopsys (SNPS)A hexagonal grid with different tech-related icons; Tech stocks illustration. Best Tech stocksSource: whiteMocca / ShutterstockOne way you can tell Synopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) and these other two stocks have gotten ahead of themselves is by their share prices. They’re all triple digits, with Fair Isaac closing in on $800. One of the reasons its stock is up 37% in 2023 and 383% over the past five years is the company’s electronic design automation (EDA) software that helps engineers design chips. Of course, it doesn’t hurt that everyone and their dog has jumped on the AI bandwagon. In March, the company launched a suite of AI-powered EDA tools to reduce designing and manufacturing chip development time. Chip design has become increasingly complex. Using AI in the chip design process will reduce the need to add engineers to accelerate the process. “Using AI-driven verification with Synopsys VCS, part of Synopsys.ai EDA suite, we’ve achieved up to 10x improvement in reducing functional coverage holes and up to 30% increase in IP verification productivity demonstrating the ability of AI to help us address the challenges of our increasingly complex designs,” Takahiro Ikenobe, IP Development Director, Shared R&amp;D Core IP Division at Renesas, stated in Synopsys’s March 29 press release. Naturally, this emphasis on AI has led to higher revenues. In Q2 2023, its Design Automation segment (EDA software) revenues grew 13.4% over last year to $927.6 million, or 66.5% overall. The segment’s operating margins were a healthy 38.8%, down slightly from Q2 2022. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:PM) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Philip Morris International The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Philip Morris InternationalThe Executive Chairman of the Board, Andre Calantzopoulos, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$8.0m worth of shares at a price of US$100 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$94.89. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Philip Morris International insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider Ownership Of Philip Morris InternationalLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Philip Morris International insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$230m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Philip Morris International Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Philip Morris International shares in the last quarter. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Philip Morris International insiders selling. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision.

That means it’s necessary to identify undervalued sleeper stocks that aren’t necessarily unknown, but that also aren’t yet in high demand. EVs have already reached a critical mass: They aren’t a fad, they are here to stay. That means investing in up-and-coming EV stocks can and will yield strong returns. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPolestar (PSNY)Close up Polestar logo with electric car in store. Polestar (PSNY) is a Swedish automotive brand owned by Volvo Cars and GeelySource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.comPolestar (NASDAQ:PSNY) is currently going through growing pains that present an opportunity to investors in PSNY stock. The company delivered a record 51,491 vehicles in 2022. That had many investors riding high last year and brought share prices higher with it. But in 2023, Polestar is facing inevitable growing pains that have taken some of the shine off its shares. A big part of the problem is that the production starts of Polestar’s 3 SUV has been delayed. The result is that Polestar now anticipates delivering between 60,000-70,000 vehicles in 2023. That would still represent 36% growth at the upper end. It’s just that the Polestar 3 will now begin production in early 2024. The Polestar 4 remains on schedule for a Q4 production start in China and early 2024 elsewhere. The company, like so many others, is focused on efficiency this year. It has instated a hiring freeze and other cost-cutting measures. That’s all good and well, but investors should also note that the company already posted a very minimal loss in Q1. It’s pretty well run as it is. Fisker (FSR)The Fisker logo hangs on display at the November 2011 International Auto Show.Source: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.comStory continuesFisker (NYSE:FSR) has just entered the sales stage. The company delivered its first vehicle on May 25. That means investors will have a much better idea of its top-line performance in a few months. Right now, we only know that Fisker is spending a lot of money to get operations going while receiving a few hundred thousand per quarter in revenues. Q2 will basically be two-thirds of a normal quarter for the company in terms of sales. Yet investors only know that Fisker expects to produce between 1,400-1,700 vehicles in Q2. We have no idea how many deliveries it expects. That is an important factor in forecasting sales. Anyway, Fisker has entered the production stages. Up to 36,000 Ocean SUVs will be produced in 2023. The company now has to focus on balancing deliveries and liquidity concerns. Fortunately, the company has $652 million in cash and equivalents and expects $610 million in total expenses at most this year. Magna International (MGA)A Magna International (MGA) sign is on the front of a Magna building in Ontario, Canada.Source: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.comInvestors should really consider Magna International (NYSE:MGA) stock because it is already in the middle of a great experiment that can propel it much higher. The problem — if it can be called that — is that investors have shiny object syndrome. What I mean is that Magna International has fallen out of the limelight. The company successfully began production of the Ocean SUV for Fisker on time on Nov. 17 of last year. This is essentially a test trial for Magna International. The company generally acts as a third-party manufacturer for lower volume, niche models. It has now effectively become a contract manufacturer in the EV space. What that means is that Magna International may already be set up to be the go-to solution for outsourced EV manufacturing. If the Fisker Ocean proves to be a quality vehicle then MGA stock will suddenly have a lot more upside. The positive news is that based on the target price, MGA stock already has approximately 20% upside. That also doesn’t take into account the dividend yielding 3.5% currently. Toyota (TM)Toyota (TM) logo on the building of a dealership during daylightSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.comWhen it comes to legacy manufacturers and EVs, Toyota (NYSE:TM) stock hardly gets the recognition it deserves. Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) tend to get much more press. That’s arguably a function of Toyota’s laggard status. It had remained stalwart in a hybrid-first strategy under the leadership of Akio Toyoda. But Toyoda, the grandson of the founder, stepped down in January. New CEO Koji Sato intends to release 10 new battery electric vehicles by 2026. That brings Toyota into the all-electric fold and makes it competitive with other EV giants. Tesla sold 1.3 million EVs in 2022. Toyota expects to sell 1.5 million by 2026. Current expectations are that GM and Ford will be producing similar volumes by that time, perhaps more. But who would you trust to build the higher-quality vehicle? I know I’d bet on Toyota 10 times out of 10 to do so. And that’s going to matter over the long run just as it has with those brands’ respective fossil fuel vehicles. FREYR Battery (FREY)Person holding smartphone with logo of Norwegian battery company Freyr AS (FREY) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comFREYR Battery (NYSE:FREY) stock could hold the answer to the question of how environmentally friendly EV batteries really are. FREYR Battery markets itself as “clean battery solutions.” And some of its operations are located in Norway, which is one of the greenest countries in the world. The company is producing current-generation lithium-ion batteries fueled by hydroelectric and wind energy. All of those factors combine to potentially make FREYR Battery a real green solution. It provides a strong counter to arguments related to CO2 emissions and EV batteries. FREYR Battery is building parallel operations that include a U.S. manufacturing base, Giga America, and a Norway manufacturing base, Giga Arctic. The solution allows the company to judge the efficacy of both in parallel and adjust accordingly. Right now, Giga America is receiving greater attention due to the Inflation Reduction Act’s EV provisions. In time, FREY stock should grow as it represents a partnership between a leading green nation and U.S. aspirations to build partnerships in EVs with politically stable nations. Aptiv (APTV)An Aptiv (APTV) office building in Poland.Source: shutterstock.comAptiv (NYSE:APTV) supplies automotive technology and was formerly known as Delphi Systems under General Motors. The company has deep experience in the integration of software and automotive systems. It is particularly focused on autonomous driving safety, making it especially relevant as EVs gain wider acceptance. That wider acceptance will partially hinge on the development of autonomous driving in EVs. Aptiv has a real opportunity to establish itself as an authority in that realm. Back in 2019, Aptiv formed a joint venture with Hyundai focused on Level 4 and Level 5 self-driving technology. Share prices have gone up and down since then, but the positive news is that there’s plenty of upside now.Aptiv’s sales and net income both continue to grow. Those high-level figures provide a reasonable snapshot of overall health. So, Aptiv continues to do well and grow despite overarching concerns about the economy. The greater the level of autonomous driving adoption, the better for Aptiv. Blink Charging (BLNK)a blink charging station, BLNK stockSource: David Tonelson/Shutterstock.comBlink Charging (NASDAQ:BLNK) is an EV stock that gets overshadowed by bigger-name competitors in the space. But for aggressive investors seeking high growth, Blink Charging offers more. Let’s put some numbers to that growth just to give you an idea of how fast Blink Charging is growing. Total revenues increased by 121% year-over-year, reaching $21.67 million in Q1. Service revenues more than tripled during that period. And network fees jumped by 911%. However, net losses also nearly doubled, up 97% to $29.8 million. There’s clearly risk inherent in investing in Blink Charging stock. One obvious risk is interest rate risk as it pertains to growth shares like BLNK stock. They fall when rates rise and do well when rates stabilize or fall. Rate hikes are coming nearer to an end, so that works in Blink Charging’s favor. If more investors become aware of the growth metrics underpinning the company, those two factors could conspire to send BLNK shares higher very quickly. On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

It’s enough raw data that even Mr. Spock would have trouble calculating the odds in his head.Spock would turn to the Enterprise computer, which we haven’t got – but we do have the Smart Score, a sophisticated data parsing and collation tool, powered by AI-driven algorithms. The Smart Score gathers data on those thousands of stocks, and then rates each stock against a set of 8 separate factors that have been shown to match up with future outperformance. In the end, each stock gets a single-digit score on a scale of 1 to 10 – with a ‘Perfect 10’ indicating a stock that, quite logically, deserves a second look.So, let’s do that. We’ve opened up the TipRanks database and pulled up the details on 3 of these top-rated, ‘Perfect 10’ stocks, and gone on to find out what the analysts have to say about them. Here they are, with the analyst commentaries.Phillips 66 (PSX)The first name on our list is Phillips 66, one of the world’s major oil companies. This firm, with its $44.5 billion market cap, has been reaping the gains from oil’s post-pandemic rise and saw its annual revenues jump from $111 billion in 2021 to $170 billion last year. Phillips generates these numbers by bringing crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas products – mainly liquids – to the refineries, and then marketing a wide range of refined hydrocarbon products, including automotive and fuels, fuel and lubricating oils, petrochemicals, and other industrial chemicals.The company currently has 13 active refineries, and markets its fuels under several brand names, including the widely known Conoco, 76, and the eponymous Phillips 66. In fact, the company’s shield logo is one of the more widely recognized branding symbols on US highways. Phillips products are used both in and out of the transportation sector, in the aviation industry, in industrial chemicals, in agriculture, and in the pharmaceutical business.Story continuesIn its most recent quarterly report, for 1Q23, Phillips showed a slowdown in revenue generation, with the $35.1 billion top line slipping from the $36.6 billion reported in the year-ago period. At the same time, the revenues beat expectations by $562.74 million. The bottom-line earnings, reported as a non-GAAP EPS of $4.21, were 65 cents per share better than the forecasts.Phillips finished Q1 with deep pockets, including $7 billion in cash and liquid assets, as well as $6.2 billion in ‘committed capacity’ from its credit facilities. In the quarter, the company generated $2.5 billion in operating cash flow, of which $1.2 billion was free cash flow. Some $1.3 billion was returned to shareholders during the quarter, through both dividend payments and repurchases.The div payments deserve a closer look. Phillips increased its payment earlier this year, and the last payment sent, on June 1 for $1.05 per common share, represented the second payment at the higher rate. The current dividend, at $4.20 annualized, is yielding 4.3%.On the Smart Score, PSX gets a boost from its fundamental factors, which include a 47.6% return on equity for the trailing 12 month period, as well as from 100% positive news sentiment and 95% positive sentiment from the financial bloggers.Analyst Jason Gabelman, from TD Cowen, is bullish here, noting Phillips’ overall strong performance in a vital industry. He writes, “We expect refining operations to improve and its non-refining exposure to once again become a more appreciated differentiator. Refinery operations weakened in 2021-22 given elevated planned and unplanned maintenance. We anticipate operations to move back to levels consistent with pre-Covid performance, near best-in-class, including $7/bbl opex and 93% refinery utilization.”“Moreover,” Gableman went on to add, “as industry refining margins continue to normalize from peak-cycle 2022 over the next couple years, we anticipate PSX higher non-refining earnings mix and growth to become a more appreciated factor.”Gabelman’s Outperform (Buy) rating comes along with a $123 price target implying an upside of 27% for the year ahead. (To watch Gabelman’s track record, click here.)The Strong Buy consensus rating on PSX shares is based on 10 recent reviews, with a breakdown of 8 to 2 in favor of Buys over Holds. The stock’s $97.13 trading price and $121.10 average price target suggest a one-year upside potential of 25%. (See Phillips 66’s stock forecast.)GFL Environmental (GFL)For the second stock on our list, we’ll turn to a sector that most people don’t think about, but wouldn’t want to live without – waste management services. GFL, a Toronto-based company, is active across Canada, serving commercial, industrial, institutional, municipal, and residential customers. The company’s activities include disposal of liquid and solid waste, including general garbage, recyclables, commercial dumpster collection, construction debris, automotive fluids, hazardous wastes – and that’s only the beginning of the list. GFL even works with soil reclamation.Waste management – or garbage collection, as we usually think of it – is big business, far bigger than most of us ever imagine. GFL has a market cap of $13.76 billion in US currency, and saw more than C$6.76 billion ($5.11 billion) in revenue last year. The company works from a network of facilities that include everything from material recovery plants to traditional landfill, and organic processing stations to soil remediation sites.In the first quarter of this year, GFL boasted revenues of C$1.8 billion ($1.36 billion), beating the Street’s C$1.68 billion ($1.27 billion) forecast. The company’s bottom line of C$0.08 per share came in C$0.11 ahead of expectations. The firm’s revenue generation is on a generally upward trajectory, growing 22% from 2021 to 2022, and the 1Q23 top line was up 28% from the prior-year period.The Smart Score here shows several points for investors to consider. Technical factors are solid; the 12-month-change momentum came in at 50.88%, and the simple moving average (20 days over 200 days) is positive. The financial bloggers are 100% bullish, and the hedge funds tracked by TipRanks increased their holdings here by 743,000 shares last quarter.With all of these sound metrics, what caught the eye of 5-star analyst Michael Doumet, of Scotiabank, was this company’s fast growth. Doumet says, “GFL’s growth story is well understood: it is executing the playbook its larger peers executed decades ago (but is doing so, when industry pricing discipline is improved)… GFL’s attractive market selection (i.e., &gt;65% in secondary/less competitive markets) provides the basis for above-market margin expansion, and its ability to further densify its existing operating regions provide it with meaningful runway to execute accretive M&amp;A. De-leveraging to below 4x net debt before the end of 2023, with three planned divestitures (expected to be completed before the end of Q2/23), and more so beyond, could aid in a positive re-rate.”Looking ahead, Doumet puts an Outperform (Buy) rating here, with a C$58 (US$43.87) price target that suggests an upside of 17.7% for the next 12 months. (To watch Doumet’s track record, click here.)It’s clear, from the unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating based on 10 positive analyst reviews, that Wall Street is bullish on this stock. The shares are selling for US$37.28, and the US$43.81 average price target implies a gain of 17% on the one-year time horizon. (See GFL’s stock forecast.)Tecnoglass, Inc. (TGLS)Last on our list, Tecnoglass, is a leader in a specialty market within the construction materials sector. The company provides architectural glass, windows, and related aluminum products used in the construction industry, and its products can be found in everything from single-family homes to multi-family apartment dwellings to commercial buildings. The firm is based in Colombia, and holds the #1 position in the Latin American market for architectural glass – and the #2 position in the US market.Tecnoglass boasts a massive production facility in its home country, a 4.1 million square foot, vertically integrated, state-of-the-art factory that is capable of meeting the needs of more than 1,000 global customers. While Tecnoglass is active around the world, and leads its market in Latin America, some 90% of its revenue come from sales to the US construction market, especially in the fast-growing state of Florida. We should note that Florida is closely linked to Latin America, by a combination of geography and immigration.The US real estate market – particularly the residential market, was hot in 2022, and Tecnoglass saw a sharp rise in revenues and earnings. At the top line, the company’s 2022 revenue was up 44% year-over-year to hit $716.6 million. In the last quarterly report, for 1Q23, the upward trend continued. The company reported a top line of $202.6 million, up 50% y/y and beating the forecast by $11.6 million. The non-GAAP EPS figure, of $1.08 per share, was 18 cents per share better than had been expected – and was more than double the 53-cent EPS figure reported in the year-ago quarter.When we look at Tecnoglass’s Smart Score, we find powerful momentum from the technical factors – a 12-month change of 183%. The news sentiment is 100% bullish, as are the financial bloggers. Positive crowd wisdom and increasing hedge activity round out the Perfect 10; last quarter, the hedges increased their holdings of TGLS by 292,400 shares.These strong growth figures caught the eye of Stanley Elliott, 5-star analyst from Stifel. Elliott writes of Tecnoglass, “TGLS has experienced robust growth driven by market share gains, new product line expansions (entered residential in 2017), and geographic expansion, all trends we expect will continue into the foreseeable future. Further, TGLS has exposure to relatively attractive portions of the end market, with nearly 90% of sales in Florida and nearly 30% from R&amp;R. Shares currently trade at a discount to its closest peer, which we believe provides an attractive entry point opportunity.”These comments support Elliott’s initiation of coverage with a Buy rating and $60 price target indicating confidence in a 26% one-year gain. (To watch Elliott’s track record, click here.)While there are only 4 recent analyst reviews of this stock, they are all positive – giving TGLS its Strong Buy consensus rating. The shares have an average price target of $54.75 and a trading price of $47.56, suggesting a 15% upside for the year ahead.

31,27895c02-2ade-3acc-95b8-54e6c06ab003,GD,2023-06-19,Is General Dynamics (NYSE:GD) Using Too Much Debt?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-dynamics-nyse-gd-using-140011744.html,1687096811,STORY,['GD'],"[Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We note that General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) does have debt on its balance sheet. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. Check out our latest analysis for General Dynamics How Much Debt Does General Dynamics Carry?You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that General Dynamics had US$10.5b of debt in April 2023, down from US$11.5b, one year before. However, it does have US$2.04b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$8.46b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is General Dynamics' Balance Sheet?Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that General Dynamics had liabilities of US$15.5b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$17.5b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$2.04b as well as receivables valued at US$11.1b due within 12 months. So its liabilities total US$19.9b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.While this might seem like a lot, it is not so bad since General Dynamics has a huge market capitalization of US$59.5b, and so it could probably strengthen its balance sheet by raising capital if it needed to. But we definitely want to keep our eyes open to indications that its debt is bringing too much risk.Story continuesIn order to size up a company's debt relative to its earnings, we calculate its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) divided by its interest expense (its interest cover). Thus we consider debt relative to earnings both with and without depreciation and amortization expenses.General Dynamics's net debt to EBITDA ratio of about 1.6 suggests only moderate use of debt. And its strong interest cover of 12.4 times, makes us even more comfortable. While General Dynamics doesn't seem to have gained much on the EBIT line, at least earnings remain stable for now. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine General Dynamics's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the last three years, General Dynamics recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 91% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That puts it in a very strong position to pay down debt.Our ViewHappily, General Dynamics's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. And that's just the beginning of the good news since its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow is also very heartening. When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like General Dynamics is pretty sensible with its use of debt. While that brings some risk, it can also enhance returns for shareholders. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for General Dynamics   you should know about.Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today.Have feedback on this article?

32,a961368a-0124-378a-b80d-610fee86eee7,NOV,2023-06-19,There's Been No Shortage Of Growth Recently For NOV's (NYSE:NOV) Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/theres-no-shortage-growth-recently-130507589.html,1687093507,STORY,['NOV'],"[If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So on that note, NOV (NYSE:NOV) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for NOV:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.063 = US$497m ÷ (US$10b - US$2.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, NOV has an ROCE of 6.3%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Energy Services industry average of 9.8%. See our latest analysis for NOV roceIn the above chart we have measured NOV's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering NOV here  for free.The Trend Of ROCEWe're delighted to see that NOV is reaping rewards from its investments and has now broken into profitability. While the business is profitable now, it used to be incurring losses on invested capital five years ago. Additionally, the business is utilizing 56% less capital than it was five years ago, and taken at face value, that can mean the company needs less funds at work to get a return. This could potentially mean that the company is selling some of its assets.On a side note, we noticed that the improvement in ROCE appears to be partly fueled by an increase in current liabilities. Effectively this means that suppliers or short-term creditors are now funding 23% of the business, which is more than it was five years ago. It's worth keeping an eye on this because as the percentage of current liabilities to total assets increases, some aspects of risk also increase.Story continuesOur Take On NOV's ROCEIn summary, it's great to see that NOV has been able to turn things around and earn higher returns on lower amounts of capital. Astute investors may have an opportunity here because the stock has declined 62% in the last five years. So researching this company further and determining whether or not these trends will continue seems justified.On the other side of ROCE, we have to consider valuation. That's why we have a FREE intrinsic value estimation on our platform  that is definitely worth checking out.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

An FDA official, Dr. Peter Marks, indicated that the FDA may consider selecting the XBB.1.5 subvariant as the preferred target.The VRCPAC endorsement comes a month after an advisory group to the World Health Organization (“WHO”) recommended the next wave of COVID vaccines to provide protection against the XBB lineages. Earlier this month, the European Medicines Agency also backed WHO’s recommendation. All these agencies observed that though the currently authorized bivalent vaccines provide protection against the XBB lineages, the protection wanes with time.COVID vaccine makers Pfizer PFE/BioNTechBNTX, Moderna MRNA and Novavax NVAX are currently updating their own vaccines to target the XBB lineages. During the VRBPAC meeting, Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and Novavax presented their pre-clinical findings supporting the use of their own vaccines which target the XBB.1.5 variant. The preclinical data from these manufacturers indicate that a monovalent vaccine is more effective against a bivalent vaccine.While Pfizer/BioNTech expects to make their updated vaccine ready for supply by the end of next month, Moderna stated that it is prepared to supply a new variant-containing vaccine for fall 2023. Novavax, on the other hand, stated that it is currently manufacturing its protein-based monovalent XBB.1.5 COVID vaccine candidate at a commercial scale, which is intended to be in the market during the 2023 fall vaccination campaign. However, it is to be noted that these vaccines are yet to be authorized/approved for use by the FDA.Story continuesIn April, the FDA amended the emergency use authorization (“EUA”) granted to the mRNA-based vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.Following the EUA amendment, the current bivalent vaccines developed by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna would be used for all doses administered to individuals aged six months and older. Subsequently, the monovalent/original vaccines developed by these companies are no longer authorized for use in the United States. This was done with the intent to simplify the COVID immunization schedule for the majority of the country’s population.Novavax’s vaccine is currently authorized for use in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older for use as a primary two-dose regimen. The Novavax vaccine is also authorized for use as a booster dose in adults aged 18 years and older.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Primarily, the debt deal bodes relatively well for consumer sentiment. Basically, you don’t want to make too many bold decisions with a debt cloud hanging over your head.Also, one of the safe stocks post-debt ceiling drama to consider involves pet projects that cater to political interests. The Democrats generally want to build out various infrastructure projects. In particular, the debt ceiling deal helps accelerate renewable energy investments. The Republicans, they managed to fully fund national defense expenditures while also cutting non-defense spending. Thus, on paper, companies tied to the military may represent some of the best stocks after the debt ceiling debate.AMZNAmazon$126.57NEENextEra Energy$73.98LMTLockheed Martin$459.87Amazon (AMZN)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comPrimarily, the inclusion of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) on this list of stocks to buy after debt ceiling resolution centers on clarity. Should the U.S. renege on its financial obligations, the unprecedented nature of this action (or lack of action) would create many ambiguities. That’s not something the market enjoys. It’s certainly not something consumers enjoy, particularly as a failed compromise might have impacted livelihoods.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsHowever, with the two parties basically agreeing to kick the can down the road until Jan. 2025, AMZN offers its candidacy for best stocks after the debt ceiling. Fundamentally, e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales has picked up considerable momentum. In the second quarter of 2022, this stat sat at 14.5%. As of Q1 2023, it increased to 15.1%. Therefore, the drama fading should help lift consumer sentiment.Also, Amazon represents a growth machine that benefits from broader political stability. On a per-share basis, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 21.9%, above 83.69% of the competition. Therefore, AMZN makes a great case for high-potential stocks after the debt ceiling resolution.Story continuesNextEra Energy (NEE)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comFor NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE), its inclusion for stocks to buy after the debt ceiling resolution aligns with political dynamics. According to The Wall Street Journal, the debt ceiling bill “…makes some of the most far-reaching changes to the country’s landmark environmental law in decades, potentially accelerating new renewable-energy investments championed by the Biden administration.” I see this as good news for NEE stock.Per the WSJ, the bills “…tightens the scope of environmental reviews required under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970 and allows more projects to win approval without having to undergo the most complex types of reviews.” With the conflict in Eastern Europe also pressuring the drive for energy alternatives, NextEra could be a major beneficiary. Thus, NEE is one of the post-debt ceiling stocks to consider.To be fair, NextEra as a utility company doesn’t offer sterling financials. For example, its balance sheet presents some risks, especially with its lowly cash-to-debt ratio of 0.03 times. However, because it’s a powerful utility firm, it hits home regarding consistent profitability. For that, it’s one of the safe stocks post-debt ceiling drama.Lockheed Martin (LMT)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comA controversial idea for some investors because of its defense applications, Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) nevertheless represents one of the stocks to buy after debt ceiling resolution. In terms of relevance, LMT is a big winner. Politically speaking, both President Joe Biden and various high-profile Republicans have spoken highly of our servicemembers. Therefore, getting the debt deal passed enables clarity, especially for defense spending.Another reason why LMT ranks among the high-potential stocks after debt ceiling centers on the broader geopolitical environment. Increasingly, nations adversarial to the U.S. have tested its resolve. One can also argue that other countries have toyed with the Biden administration to find any vulnerabilities. Therefore, as one of the spears in the national defense architecture, Lockheed stands as a cynical beneficiary.Also, those looking for bargains among the best stocks after the debt ceiling should consider the defense contractor. Currently, the market prices LMT at a forward multiple of 17.24. As a discount to projected earnings, Lockheed ranks better than 63.46% of the competition.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Masco The MethodWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$855.9mUS$793.4mUS$847.7mUS$853.0mUS$861.6mUS$873.2mUS$886.9mUS$902.3mUS$919.0mUS$936.7mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x9Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 1.01%Est @ 1.34%Est @ 1.57%Est @ 1.73%Est @ 1.85%Est @ 1.93% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.4% US$782US$663US$647US$595US$550US$509US$473US$440US$409US$381(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$5.4bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$937m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (9.4%– 2.1%) = US$13bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$13b÷ ( 1 + 9.4%)10= US$5.3bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$11b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$55.5, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Masco as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.228. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for MascoStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Building market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Although the valuation of a company is important, it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. For Masco, we've compiled three additional items you should look at:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 2 warning signs for Masco (1 is a bit concerning!) we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for MAS's future outlook?

One, increased consumer spending on physical products, and two, continued AI proliferation. The three high-growth sectors I’ll profile in this column are poised to benefit from these trends.Notably, the trend of increased spending on physical products was, I believe, foreshadowed by macroeconomic data released on June 5. On that day, the Institute for Supply Management reported a decline in non-manufacturing PMI from 51.9 in April to 50.3 last month.Meanwhile, “orders for non-defense capital goods excluding aircraft rose 1.3% in April,” coming on the heels of a 1.4% increase in the same metric in March. The gains suggest US factories are gearing up to increase output of consumer goods in anticipation of rising demand in H2 2023. Thus, analysts and companies indicate that demand for consumer electronics has likely bottomed and will rebound in the second half.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsOf course, AI’s tremendous power has taken the business world and consumers by storm and will continue to do so.With that said, here are my three top sectors for investment for the second half of 2023.E-Commercee-commerce stocksSource: ShutterstockE-commerce will benefit from increased consumer buying activity in the second half of this year.Why? Well, the sector is poised to get a big boost from the proliferation of AI. The technology will boost e-commerce revenue by targeting consumers with personalized ads and product suggestions. Additionally, the technology will reduce costs for suppliers, enabling e-commerce firms to offer better prices, increasing profits along the way.Investors will see e-commerce companies benefit from autonomous vehicles, drones, and robots enabled by AI. What’s more, the repetitive routes that e-commerce companies utilize are tailor-made for autonomous vehicles. Experts have highlighted significant demand for autonomous trucks in optimizing supply chains and reducing delivery expenses.Story continuesAccordingly, among my favorite e-commerce stocks to buy right now are Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Coupang (NYSE:CPNG), and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD).Roboticsa computer rendering of Miso Robotics's ""Flippy"" robotSource: Miso RoboticsI believe that, as excitement over the capabilities of AI greatly increases, the utilization of AI-powered robotics will surge. Increased AI investments will enhance robot capabilities, driving higher adoption and utilization across firms. These trends should start becoming evident in the second half of the year. As a result, I believe that robotics is one of the top high-growth sectors in which to invest at this point.Already, many more industries are starting to utilize robots than in the past, with health care, aerospace, and even food and beverage firms using robots on a wider scale. Tech giants like Amazon and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) are leading the way with widespread robot usage, inspiring other firms to follow suit.Indeed, according to Investopedia, “market research analysts have forecast the robotics market will expand to $214.7 billion by 2030, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of almost 23%.1.”Currently, some of my favorite picks in the robotics space are ABB (NYSE:ABB) and Nuance Communications (NASDAQ:NUAN).Semiconductorssemiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockSemiconductor, or chip, makers have a wide range of massive, positive catalysts going forward. Among these catalysts are the huge demand for chips needed to create AI systems, and tremendous increases in the amount of chips used in automobiles.Further, on the AI front, data centers are going to need to utilize more chips in order to generate the computing power and network bandwidth that are required to process AI workloads.Indeed, many chip makers beyond Wall Street’s favorite name in the sector, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), are going to benefit from these strong trends. For example, Qualcomm’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) chips appear to have more “power efficiency” than those of Nvidia. Consequently, Qualcomm’s offerings are well-positioned to be used to power AI systems after they’re launched.Moreover, Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), whose equipment is used to make chips, is going to get a big lift from surges in the sheer number of chips needed to create and power AI systems and automobiles.Finally, Intel ‘s (NASDAQ:INTC) chips appear to be well-suited for generating “some AI capabilities,” while the company appears to be poised to manufacture many chips for Nvidia.Accordingly, given the proliferation of the Internet of Things and artificial intelligence, these stocks are likely to continue to surge higher from here.As of the date of publication, Larry Ramer owned shares of INTC.

To skip our detailed analysis, head directly to the 10 Largest Economies in the World in 2023.Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the market value of all finished goods and services produced in a country within a specific time period. The GDP can help gauge the health and size of a country’s economy. The world’s total output was estimated to be above $100 trillion in 2022. A report by the United Nations has projected global GDP to grow at 2.3% in 2023 and 2.5% in 2024. Prospects of economic recovery from the effects of Covid-19 pandemic remain dim amid rising interest rates, high inflation, and global uncertainties. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has further complicated matters.The United States is the largest economy in the world, which is expected to grow by 1.1% in 2023. China’s GDP growth is forecasted at 5.3%, while Europe’s economies are projected to grow by a mere 0.9% this year.A report released by the McKinsey Global Institute highlighted the impact of corporations on the global economy in the 21st century. It was found that the business sector contributed 72% of the gross domestic product (GDP) in OECD member nations. Companies that have more than $1 billion in annual revenue contribute the major chunk in that percentage. In 2017, about $14 trillion of the United States’ then GDP of $20 trillion was coming from the corporate sector. Cargill, which is the largest privately held corporation in the U.S., had a revenue of $165 billion in 2022 – a staggering amount that is greater than the GDP of some entire nations. Publicly listed companies like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) also play a significant role in retaining the U.S.’s status of the largest economy in the world.Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) recorded a revenue of $394 billion in 2022. Earlier this year in March, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported a 9% increase in profits for the first quarter of 2023 - $18.3 billion, or $2.45 per share. In the defense sector, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) is the largest defense contractor in the world that produces billions of dollars worth military equipment for countries around the world. You can read more on Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) in Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023.Story continuesThe last couple of decades, however, have witnessed the beginning of a radical shift in global economic power from advanced countries towards emerging markets. Economic growth in the developing and emerging countries has been 5.8%, on average, since the year 2000, which is considerably higher than the mean 1.8% seen in the advanced nations during the same period. Economies of the Emerging 7, or E7 countries, were half the size of the G7 countries in 1995, and in 2015, both groups were relatively the same size. By 2040, the E7 economies are expected to be twice the size of G7. This is discussed in detail in our article, the 25 Most Powerful Countries in the World in 2023.Asian CenturyThe 21st century has also been dubbed by economic experts as the Asian Century. China and India are already among the top five largest economies in the world. China is the second largest economy in the world after the United States. India now boasts an economy nearing $4 trillion and hosts global tech giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Twitter that employ thousands. According to the World Economic Forum (WEF), Asia, which is home to nearly half of the world’s population, is likely to generate more than 50% of the world’s GDP by 2040. The continent accounts for nearly one-third of the world’s total trade, up from about a quarter a decade ago. China and India have been forecasted by the PwC to become the two largest economies of the world in 2050, going past the United States. European Union’s share of the global GDP is likely to reduce to a mere 9%, with France expected to be out of the top 10, and Italy out of the top 20 largest economies in the world. Indonesia is also projected to be among the top seven largest economies of the world in 2050. Vietnam and Philippines are expected to take strides as well in the coming decades. Pakistan may become the sixth largest economic power by 2075, according to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS).MethodologyWe have used nominal GDPs of countries to rank the 50 largest economies in the world in 2023. Data has been sourced from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The GDP numbers are from 2022.Here are the largest economies in the world in 2023:50 Largest Economies in the World in 2023dibrova/Shutterstock.com50. PortugalGDP: $252 billionWe begin our list with Portugal, a southern European country that borders Spain. The country’s economy has bounced back from the pandemic-induced recession. The growth has been driven by strong domestic demand and resumption of tourism in the country. Portugal’s GDP is expected to grow by 2.4% in 2023.49. IraqGDP: $270 billionIraq recorded a GDP growth of 8% in 2022. One of the main reasons for this was the country's 12% increase in oil output, as noted by IMF, and high oil prices around the world, which provided much needed respite to the Iraqi economy.48. FinlandGDP: $281 billionFinland had a GDP of $281 billion in 2022. The country's 60% of exports are to members of the European Union, with Germany and Sweden being its largest trade partners. Finland experienced a mild recession in 2022, because of which, economic growth is expected to remain low in the first half of 2023.47. Czech RepublicGDP: $290 billionCzech Republic made the list of the largest economies in the world in 2023 due to the size of its GDP, which was measured at $290 billion in 2022. Economic growth, however, is expected to decline, from 2.5% in 2022 to 0.2% in 2023. Inflation is expected to decelerate from 14.6% in 2022 to 11.9% in 2023. It is also one of the 20 largest economies in Europe.46. ChileGDP: $301 billionChile had a GDP of $301 billion and a growth rate of 2.4% in 2022. The economy is expected to grow slightly in 2023, driven by exports, especially lithium and copper. Inflation has been projected by the World Bank to remain high in the short term. Poverty will remain around 11.5%.45. RomaniaGDP: $302 billionRomania had a robust GDP growth of 4.2% in 2022, with the size of its economy measured at $302 billion by the IMF. This was driven by increased investments and private consumption. The country has a GDP per capita of $14,643. More than 1,800 Romanians work for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). In 2022, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced to open its first data center in Romania.44. ColombiaGDP $344 billionColombia’s economy grew at 7.3% in 2022 but has overheated due to activity beyond its potential, said the World Bank. It is projected to slow down and grow by a mere 1.7% in 2023. However, growth is expected to increase to 2% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2025. Crude petroleum, coal, and coffee are the country’s main exports.43. IranGDP: $352 billion Despite economic sanctions and an inflation rate of 42.5%, Iran’s economy is projected to grow by 2.2% in 2023. However long-term prospects of the economy look gloomy with no revival of a nuclear deal in sight.42. Hong KongGDP: $361 billionHong Kong’s economy shrank by 4.1% in the last three quarters of 2022, but has staged a recovery in 2023, driven by an increase in tourism and local spending. The government’s GDP growth forecast for 2023 is between 3.5-5%, and Hong Kong is well on track to achieve it.41. PakistanGDP: $376 billionPakistan is the fifth most populous nation in the world, with its youth bulge being the driving force of the economy. However, security and political turmoil in the last decade has pegged the country back from reaching its full potential. In 2023, Pakistan risks facing default with its foreign exchange reserves critically low and revenues shrinking. You can read more on it in our list of the top companies in Pakistan.40. DenmarkGDP: $391 billionDenmark received a ‘stable’ outlook from Fitch and was forecast to narrowly avoid technical recession in 2023. The OECD has projected a growth rate of 0.1% this year and for inflation to fall from 8% to under 3% by 2024. It has also been regarded as one of the best countries to start a business, owing to its relatively low corporate tax rate of 22%. In addition, Copenhagen is considered the logistics hub in the Nordic region, providing access to 100 million Scandinavian customers within 24 hours. For this reason, the country attracts a lot of shipping businesses catering to Nordic countries.39. PhilippinesGDP: $404 billionPhilippines is on track to become an upper middle-income economy, according to the country director for Asian Development Bank (ADB). Its economy is expected to grow 6% in 2023 and climb further by 6.2% in 2024. PwC’s report titled ‘The World in 2050’ has projected that Philippines will be among the 20 largest economies in the world by 2050.38. South AfricaGDP: $406 billionScheduled power cuts that started in 2007 have constrained South Africa’s economic growth. This has disrupted economic activity by increasing operating costs for businesses. The Covid-19 pandemic further exacerbated the country’s woes. According to the World Bank, there were half a million fewer jobs in 2022 than in 2019. Despite these challenges, South Africa remains an economic power in the African continent.37. VietnamGDP: $407 billionVietnam’s GDP grew by 8% in 2022. That has slowed down in 2023 to 3.3% in the first quarter. This is due to the ongoing recession in the European Union and the United States – two key trade partners that account for 40% of Vietnam’s exports, according to S&amp;P Global. However, Vietnam is expected to resume rapid economic growth as it remains a key southeast Asian manufacturing hub.36. MalaysiaGDP: $408 billionThe Malaysian economy continues to thrive and recorded a GDP growth of 5.6% in the first quarter of 2023, which was higher than some of the other prominent countries in the neighborhood, such as Indonesia, China, and Vietnam. Malaysia’s GDP is projected to rise from $408 billion in 2022 to $780 billion by 2032 – an increase of 90% in a decade.35. BangladeshGDP: $460 billionBangladesh’s economy is expected to grow by 5.3% in 2023, which is the third highest growth rate among South Asian countries after Maldives and India. In 2021, the country surpassed India on per capita income, and has an 80% higher per capita GDP than Pakistan – the country it took independence from in 1971.34. SingaporeGDP: $467 billionSingapore is a high-income economy and boasts a gross national income per capita of over $64,000 according to the World Bank. Singapore is a major international financial hub, and its currency, the Singapore Dollar, is among the 15 Most Powerful Currencies in the World – accounting for nearly 1.8% of all foreign exchange trading daily. The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) has announced building a forex trading hub in Singapore in collaboration with JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE:JPM).33. AustriaGDP: $472 billionStrong domestic demand is likely to help Austria recover from its current economic downturn. According to the OECD, Austria’s GDP growth is expected to be 0.2% in 2023, and then 1.6% in 2024. Economic forecasts suggest real wages to rise and inflation to ease in the ongoing fiscal year.32. EgyptGDP: $475 billionEgypt had a GDP of $475 billion in 2022 with an economic growth of 6.6%. However, this growth is expected to decline in 2023 to 4.5% according to the World Bank. Inflation is expected to remain in double digits, surpassing the government’s target range between 5-9%.31. NigeriaGDP: $477 billionAfrica’s biggest economy Nigeria has the largest gas reserves in the continent, and proven crude oil reserves of 37.1 billion barrels. World Bank has projected the Nigerian economy to grow by an average of 2.9% between 2023 and 2025. The country had a GDP of $477 billion in 2022.30. United Arab EmiratesGDP: $507 billionThe United Arab Emirates economy is the second largest in the Arab world. The GDP was estimated to have grown by 7.6% in 2022 – the highest expansion in 11 years – and growth prospects are expected to remain above 7% in 2023 as well. The country has recovered sharply from the slowdown induced by Covid-19 and the government plans to double the size of the economy by 2031.29. IsraelGDP: $523 billionIsrael ranks among the countries that spend the highest on research &amp; development and is widely recognized in the world as a leader in innovation. In 2022, it had a nominal GDP of $523 billion, and a GNI per capita of about $50,000.28. IrelandGDP: $530 billionIreland had the fastest growing economy in Europe in 2022 with a GDP growth of 12.2%, driven by higher private consumption, investments by multinationals, and continued growth in exports. According to the IMF, it had a GDP of $530 billion in 2022.27. ThailandGDP: $536 billionAfter easing travel restrictions in May 2022, Thailand has seen a surge in international tourism arrivals. This has resulted in rebounding the country’s economy and helped it recover from effects of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Thai economy has grown by 2.7% in the first quarter of 2023, compared with 1.4% in the final quarter of 2022.26. NorwayGDP: $579 billionNorway had a GDP of $579 billion in 2022. The country derives much of its wealth from energy resources and is one of the world’s largest exporters of oil. Norwegian oil giant Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR) is one of the leading suppliers of energy to Europe and operates in 36 countries.25. BelgiumGDP: $582 billionBelgium hosts the headquarters of NATO and the European Union, making it one of the most politically influential countries in the world. It is a developed economy and had a GDP of $582 billion in 2022. According to OECD’s economic outlook for Belgium, the country is forecast to have a GDP growth of 0.9% in 2023 which will rise to 1.4% in 2024. Inflation this year is set to decrease due to falling energy prices.24. SwedenGDP: $586 billionSweden is a Scandinavian country with a GDP of $586 billion in 2022, ranking 24th on our list based on economic data released by the IMF. However, the country is going through recession and the economic outlook for 2023 was described by the Swedish government as ‘gloomy’ in as early as October last year. According to reports, the economy is set to contract by 1% instead of the projected 0.7% figure.23. ArgentinaGDP: $632 billionArgentina is the third largest economy in South America behind Brazil and Mexico but is going through one of the worst economic crises in its history. Annual inflation rate soared past 100% in April 2023 – the third highest in the world after Venezuela and Zimbabwe. The country’s central bank has hiked interest rates to 97% with the hope that this measure will incentivize investments in the local currency.22. PolandGDP: $688 billionPoland has been one of the most affected countries due to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine because of a large influx of refugees and increased energy prices, which have taken a toll on the Polish economy and dimmed hopes of a post-pandemic recovery. Poland’s GDP growth has crashed from 5.1% in 2022 to a projection of 0.7% in 2023. However, EU forecasts expect economic growth to rebound in 2024 to 2.7%.21. TaiwanGDP: $762 billion Taiwan, located at the junction of the East and South China Seas, had a GDP of $762 billion in 2022. In 2021, its GNI per capita was reported at just under $35,000. Taiwan’s economic growth has remained consistently high for several decades now and is referred to as one of the four ‘Asian Tigers’ alongside Singapore, South Korea, and Hong Kong.20. SwitzerlandGDP: $807 billionSwitzerland is one of the largest economies in Europe and is known for its banking and finance sector. The Swiss Franc is the 8th most traded currency in the world in the foreign exchange market. Switzerland is one of the world’s wealthiest countries and acts as a ‘safe haven’ for financial investors during times of instability.19. TürkiyeGDP: $906 billionWith an output of over $900 billion, Türkiye’s economy is the 19th largest in the world in terms of nominal GDP. The country is a member of the G20 and OECD. Despite the fact that the Turkish Lira has lost 60% of its value against the U.S. Dollar since 2021, the Turkish economy remains strong and grew by 5.2% in 2022. However, the devastating earthquakes that occurred this year inflicted direct losses exceeding $34 billion, adding pressures to the country’s macro-financial situation.18. NetherlandsGDP: $994 billionNetherlands’ economy is close to touching $1 trillion. Despite having a population of only 17 million, it is one of Europe’s strongest economies. Dutch multinational company Koninklijke Philips N.V. (NYSE:PHG), or Philips, is headquartered in Amsterdam. The economy, like other countries in the region, is likely to slow down, from a GDP of 4.3% in 2022 to 0.8% in 2023. 17. Saudi ArabiaGDP: $1.1 trillionSaudi Arabia is the 17th largest economy in the world with a GDP of over $1 trillion. The kingdom is a permanent and founding member of OPEC, and one of the biggest oil exports globally. Saudi Arabia’s share of oil exports in total exports increased from 71% in 2021 to 79% in 2022. The Saudis are leveraging their economic power to modernize their military as well. The country was the fifth biggest defense spender in 2022 having spent a whopping $75 billion on military expenditure that year. You can read more on this in our article, the 25 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2023. 16. IndonesiaGDP: $1.31 trillion Indonesia with a GPD of $1.31 trillion in 2022 is the biggest economy in southeast Asia and one of the emerging market economies. It is also part of the G20. Indonesia is expected to be the fourth largest economy in the world in 2050 as per projections by PwC. 15. SpainGDP: $1.4 trillionSpain is an economic powerhouse in Europe with a GDP of $1.4 trillion. The country’s economic growth however is likely to decline from 5.5% in 2022 to about 1% in 2023. Investors are confident of a rebound soon because the Spanish economy has not been hit as badly as some other European nations from Russia’s war on Ukraine. This is due to Madrid’s focus on specialized production and less reliance on the Ukrainian and Russian economies.14. MexicoGDP: $1.41 trillion Mexico is tipped to be seventh largest economy in the world in 2050 by PwC. The South American nation currently boasts a GDP nearing $1.5 trillion. It has a growing influence in North America and is one of the biggest exporters in the Latin America region. Tourism is thriving in the country; over 18 million visitors flocked to Mexico in 2022.13. South KoreaGDP: $1.65 trillionSouth Korea is Asia’s fourth largest economy by nominal GDP and among the fastest growing emerging markets in the world. It registered a GDP growth rate of 2.6% in 2022, which is expected to decline in 2023 to 1.6% due to recession in the U.S. and EU, and a slowdown in the electronics industry. Last year, South Korea had a GDP of $1.65 trillion.12. AustraliaGDP: $1.7 trillionAustralia experienced its slowest GDP growth in over a year and a half in the first quarter of 2023. The GDP rose by only 0.2% as high inflation and interest rates impacted consumer spending. Earlier this year, KPMG had also forecasted the Australian economy to slow down in 2023, but keep away from recession. Despite challenges, it is one of the world’s largest economies, and its currency, the Australian Dollar, is the premiere currency of the Asia-Pacific region. 11. BrazilGDP: $1.92 trillionBrazil ranks 11th in our list of the 50 largest economies in the world in 2023. The size of the Brazilian economy is closing in on the $2 trillion mark. Given its substantial land, resources, and population, the South American nation is poised for further economic growth in years to come.

The program has since incurred $7 billion in losses.Airbus teamed with Lockheed in 2018 for the second phase, called KC-Y.The U.S. Air Force expects to decide later this year how many tankers to buy after the KC-46's initial production run ends in 2029 and whether it will hold a competition.However, officials are keen to speed up development of a next-generation tanker it hopes to buy in the mid-2030s and could halve the number of jets purchased in KC-Y.The new plan could diminish the Lockheed-Airbus team’s business case, which people familiar with the matter said was contingent on production of about 100 LMXTs.NO FINAL DECISIONThat would allow Airbus to launch A330 production in the United States – a detail seen as critical for obtaining support on Capitol Hill - and hire 1,300 workers across Lockheed and Airbus plants in Alabama and Georgia.Story continuesOver the past year, Air Force leaders have repeatedly said a sole-source contract to Boeing is the likely outcome, although a final decision has not been made.But Larry Gallogly, Lockheed’s director of LMXT business development, said Lockheed and Airbus ""are most definitely still in this competition."" The companies announced a third American supplier, engine-maker General Electric, on June 6.Lockheed and Airbus sought a program of at least 120 aircraft, but “the business case can certainly close below that,” Gallogly said.Boeing Defense CEO Ted Colbert said the KC-46 ""has proven to be highly capable"" and is ready for the threats of the 2030s.A Boeing win would ensure 767 widebody production extends into the mid-2030s, while a Lockheed-Airbus victory would hand Airbus its first aircraft contract with the U.S. Air Force after attempting to penetrate the U.S. defense market for two decades.Both Airbus and Boeing carry battle scars from the previous competition, which Airbus lost after a decade-long contest that included a corruption scandal that put a Boeing official in prison and a legal protest that overturned Airbus’s initial win.The KC-46 has weathered scrutiny from Congress after technical flaws pushed the program years off schedule. The House Armed Services Committee's draft defense bill would cap the KC-46 purchase at 179 planes, but the service could easily overcome that limit by providing cost estimates.Advocacy for the LMXT could fall to Representative Jerry Carl, an Alabama Republican and member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee. The panel is set to debate defense appropriations on Thursday, but it is unclear whether Carl will offer an amendment forcing the Air Force to open the contract to competition, as he did in a failed attempt last year.Carl's office did not respond to a request for comment.(Reporting by Valerie Insinna and Tim Hepher; Editing by Mark Potter)]"

Chief Executive Tony Douglas said the owners would impose strict financial expectations, which he did not specify.Douglas was speaking at an event to present the airline on the eve of the Paris Airshow. It is launching at a time when airlines are under pressure to meet industry emission targets, with some facing legal pressure over alleged greenwashing.""Ultimately it will be commercial aviation sustainability that will differentiate the winners and the losers, and anyone who doesn't take it seriously will probably fail for sure,"" Douglas said.The creation of a second Saudi national airline was announced alongside a provisional order for up to 72 Boeing 787s in March, as oil producer Saudi Arabia diversifies its economy.Douglas ruled out any further aircraft announcements at this week's show.However, industry sources said Riyadh Air was likely to sign a deal with General Electric for engines to power the recently ordered Dreamliners.Riyadh Air declined to comment. GE, which competes with Britain's Rolls-Royce to power the wide-body jets, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Douglas said Riyadh Air continued to conduct a contest between Airbus and Boeing for narrowbody jets.The airline plans to show a 787 this week painted in the airline's new indigo livery.Douglas declined to give details of the airline's cabin product which he said would be rolled out progressively.But he said it would involve an ""obsessional"" level of attention to detail, aided by systems to track passenger preferences closer to Amazon or Spotify than typical airlines.Story continuesRiyadh Air is launching flights in 2025 in a region whose carriers have well-established brands for high service levels.Qatar Airways last year won Skytrax airline of the year for the seventh year in a row and Emirates last month topped the Business Traveller Middle East awards for a tenth time.Douglas said it was easier to incorporate the latest digital customisation from scratch without starting with legacy systems. That echoes claims by Air India, whose systems are so antiquated that its new CEO has saidits relaunchamounts to a clean sheet.Asked whether Riyadh Air would serve alcohol in its cabins amid Saudi Arabia's strict laws on drinking, Douglas said the airline would always follow any laws that applied.

That’s roughly the perspective of Morgan Stanley’s Mike Wilson, who has not been a fan of bidding up what could be a potentially overheated market.Instead, Wilson believes that for those that wish to stay in the equities sector, investors should focus on securities with defensive characteristics, operational efficiency, and earnings stability. For this list of bargain stocks in a hot market, that’s exactly what I’m offering with the below ideas.Specifically, I filtered out publicly traded companies for their Piotroski F-Score, which considers profitability, leverage (liquidity), and operating efficiency. Generally speaking, a score between 7 through 9 indicates good value. On that note, below are the top-value stocks in a bull market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCigna (CI)Cigna logo displayed on a modern smartphone. CI stock.Source: Piotr Swat / ShutterstockA global health service company, Cigna (NYSE:CI) ranks among the best undervalued stocks to buy thanks to its secular relevancy. Historically, the healthcare segment offers several ideas for defensive play since the demand for it remains reasonably stable irrespective of market cycles. However, the market doesn’t see it that way, with CI stock losing over 17% of its equity value. For astute investors, though, this fallout could be an upside opportunity.According to data from investment resource Gurufocus, the market prices Cigna shares at a forward multiple of 10.81. As a discount to projected earnings, Cigna ranks better than 66.67% of sector rivals. Moreover, CI trades at a trailing multiple of 12.12. In contrast, the sector median value stands at 21.71 times. As well, CI ranks among the bargain stocks in the hot market thanks to its Piotroski F-Score of 8. This stat suggests high operating efficiency, an implication confirmed by Cigna’s return on equity (ROE) of 14.91% (above 68.42% of competitors).Story continuesArcher Daniels Midland (ADM)BSFC Stock. Healthy food including salmon, almonds, garlic, broccoli, avocado, and lettuceSource: Shutterstock.comAt the most basic level, Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) makes a great case for the best undervalued stocks to buy under present conditions thanks to overriding relevance. As a multinational food processing and commodities trading firm, Archer Daniels essentially enjoys a permanently relevant profile. However, the market has other ideas, sending ADM lower by slightly over 19% on a year-to-date basis.Such red ink might be overdoing it. Either way, ADM on paper represents one of the value stocks in a bull market. Specifically, the market prices ADM at a forward multiple of 10.44. As a discount to projected earnings, Archer Daniels ranks better than 81.25% of companies listed in the consumer packaged goods industry. Also, ADM features a price-earnings-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.56, far lower than the sector median of 1.7 times.According to Gurufocus, Archer Daniels features a Piotroski F-Score of 7, which is a solid rating. Helping to confirm Archer’s efficiency is the company’s ROE, which comes in at 18.37%. This stat ranks better than 85% of its peers, making ADM one of the undervalued stocks to buy.ICL Group (ICL)A tractor spreading fertilizer over a farm field.Source: Fotokostic / Shutterstock.comA company thrust into cynical relevance due to geopolitical flashpoints, ICL Group (NYSE:ICL) is a multinational manufacturing company. Primarily, the entity develops produces, and markets fertilizers, metals, and other special-purpose chemical products, per its public profile. With global food crises becoming a prominent risk factor, ICL is one of the unignorable entities among the best undervalued stocks.As with the other enterprises on this list, the market doesn’t see it that way (for now). Since the Jan. opener, shares plunged slightly over 24%. Nevertheless, recent trades suggest a turnaround might be in order. Either way, because of the fallout, ICL trades at a trailing multiple of 3.95, according to Fintel. That matches up with info from Gurufocus, making ICL significantly undervalued.In addition, ICL also prints a three-year revenue growth rate of 23.6% (on a per-share basis), beating out 69.3% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period impresses at 50.5%. Overall, ICL’s Piotroski F-Score lands at 9 out of 9. You really can’t get better than that.Murphy USA (MUSA)A photo of a row of gasoline pump handles at a pump with the sun shining on them. Gas prices dropping.Source: ThePowerPlant/ShutterStock.comAs an operator of a chain of discount retail gasoline stations, Murphy USA (NYSE:MUSA) ranks among the best undervalued stocks because of its everyday utility. True, economic conditions might impact fuel demand. However, people still need to get around. Additionally, with companies beginning to recall their workers back to the office in earnest, MUSA might become a cynical beneficiary.Plus, on paper, Murphy USA ranks as one of the high potential undervalued stocks. Mainly, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate clocks in at 30.5%, beating out 88.87% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period impresses at a sterling 56.9%. Despite this outperformance, MUSA trades at a trailing sales multiple of 0.28. As a discount to revenue, the company ranks better than 75.84% of the competition.Notably, the company’s Piotroski F-Score lands at 7 out of 9, which is a decent score. Just as well, Murphy’s ROE pings at 85.22%, outflanking 97% of its peers. Thus, it’s a great idea for bargain stocks in a hot market.Integra Lifesciences (IART)surgeons operating on a patientSource: Dmytro Zinkevych / Shutterstock.comHeadquartered in Princeton, New Jersey, Integra Lifesciences (NASDAQ:IART) is a global leader in regenerative tissue technologies and neurosurgical solutions dedicated to limiting uncertainty for clinicians. As an advanced medical technology firm, Integra enjoys relevance in any market cycle. However, IART is one of the riskiest ideas on this list of value stocks in a bull market, shedding 27% YTD.Still, for those that don’t mind ramping up their risk-reward profile, IART could be intriguing. First, Gurufocus labels Integra as significantly undervalued. Most noticeably, the market prices IART at a forward multiple of 12.79. As a discount to projected earnings, Integra ranks better than 96.94% of companies listed in the medical devices sector.Second, the company’s Piotroski F-Score stands at 9 out of 9, indicating superior operational efficiency. In addition, Integra’s ROE comes in at 10.13%, ranked better than 73.26% of its peers. As such, it’s one of the best undervalued stocks for speculators.Photronics (PLAB)AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip. Tech science background. Integrated communication processor. 3D illustration representing semiconductor stocksSource: ShutterstockAs a technology firm, Photronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) might not seem an ideal play among the best undervalued stocks. Moreover, tech plays usually tend to be cyclical, which wouldn’t be ideal as a defensive proposition. However, Photronics’ semiconductor photomask provider business offers myriad applications and broad utility. As a result, shares skyrocketed over 36% since the beginning of this year.Despite the strong performance in the charts, PLAB makes a compelling case for value stocks in a bull market. For instance, the company’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 19.2%, above 68.43% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same frame clocks in at 38.7%, above 72.27%. Nevertheless, PLAB still trades at a trailing sales multiple of 1.61, below the sector median of 2.72 times.Lastly, Photronics benefits from a Piotroski F-Score of 8 out of 9. Combined with an ROE of 14% (ranked above 70.32% of sector players), PLAB makes for an intriguing case for undervalued stocks to buy.TD Synnex (SNX)Tech stocks: Double exposure of man's hands holding and using a phone and financial graph drawing. cheap tech stocksSource: Peshkova / ShutterstockAnother tech enterprise, TD Synnex (NYSE:SNX) is a Fortune 200 company, according to its public profile.

Thanks to its broad footprint, SNX makes for an enticing case for the best undervalued stocks. Since the January opener, shares slipped nearly 4%.Nevertheless, the red ink might offer an attractive entry point for astute contrarians. Currently, the market prices SNX at a forward multiple of 8.01. As a discount to projected earnings, TD Synnex ranks better than 91.53% of sector rivals. Operationally, the company posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 20.4%, beating out 86.9% of its peers. Despite this outperformance, SNX trades at only 0.14 times trailing sales, well below the sector median of 1.36 times. On a final note, TD Synnex’s Piotroski F-Score clocks in at 7 out of 9. At the same time, its ROE pings at 8.59%, beating out 60.57% of other competitors.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. However, after briefly looking over the numbers, we don't think ANSYS (NASDAQ:ANSS) has the makings of a multi-bagger going forward, but let's have a look at why that may be.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for ANSYS, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.11 = US$650m ÷ (US$6.5b - US$651m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, ANSYS has an ROCE of 11%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 9.9% generated by the Software industry. Check out our latest analysis for ANSYS roceIn the above chart we have measured ANSYS' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.The Trend Of ROCEWhen we looked at the ROCE trend at ANSYS, we didn't gain much confidence. Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 11% from 16% five years ago. However it looks like ANSYS might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Bottom LineIn summary, ANSYS is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet. Although the market must be expecting these trends to improve because the stock has gained 86% over the last five years. However, unless these underlying trends turn more positive, we wouldn't get our hopes up too high.If you're still interested in ANSYS it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation  to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.While ANSYS isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Corporation (NYSE:VFC) Improve Its Returns?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/v-f-corporation-nyse-vfc-140928005.html,1687097368,STORY,['VFC'],"[While some investors are already well versed in financial metrics (hat tip), this article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE) and why it is important. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand V.F. Corporation (NYSE:VFC).Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for V.F How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for V.F is:4.1% = US$119m ÷ US$2.9b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.04 in profit.Does V.F Have A Good ROE?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, V.F has a lower ROE than the average (18%) in the Luxury industry classification.roeThat certainly isn't ideal. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A company with high debt levels and low ROE is a combination we like to avoid given the risk involved. To know the 4 risks we have identified for V.F visit our risks dashboard for free.The Importance Of Debt To Return On EquityVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. Thus the use of debt can improve ROE, albeit along with extra risk in the case of stormy weather, metaphorically speaking.Story continuesV.F's Debt And Its 4.1% ROEV.F clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.27. Its ROE is quite low, even with the use of significant debt; that's not a good result, in our opinion. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

Indeed, scenario analysis can be important, to see how much downside potential certain holdings may have. And while predicting the future is essentially impossible, knowing which stocks are poised to plunge, if nothing changes, is important.One clear sign that things are not headed in the right direction for companies is deteriorating analyst ratings. Analysts aren’t great at predicting the future. However, they tend to work closely with companies, holding deep insights into the firms they are tasked with covering. This can help uncover unseen issues that more casual observers simply cannot.In any case, the stocks below do suffer from weakening ratings. Worsening ratings often coincide with problematic fundamentals. Those too are present in the shares represented below.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWFCWells Fargo$41.58VNOVornado Realty Trust$15.61EDConsolidated Edison$92.61Wells Fargo (WFC)Wells Fargo (WFC) bank sign in yellow and red with wagon logo. The sign is flanked by tall grassSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is the fourth largest bank in the United States. For that reason, it might be surprising to find the company on this list of stocks to sell. Indeed, in the wake of the regional banking collapse, investors fled to larger banks for their perceived safety. Wells Fargo certainly benefited from that trend, improving the bank’s fundamentals in the near-term.Additionally, Wells Fargo’s fundamentals have shown relatively consistent improvement over the past quarter, overall. Revenues grew, net income increased, all while the bank increased provisional losses as risks became more evident. None of these factors suggests that Wells Fargo is particularly worthy of selling. Nor have analysts soured on WFC stock recently.However, the problem is that Wells Fargo is arguably the least-trusted major bank, and that’s saying something. In December the company was ordered to pay $2 billion in order to redress improper home foreclosures, illegally repossessed vehicles, and improper fees. The judgment also included a $1.7 billion civil penalty. The company has a history of problems, which is why I would sell it despite the perception that it’s a good bank due to its size. There are simply too many other great options in this sector to buy right now.Story continuesVornado Realty Trust (VNO)a person in a suit holds a tiny house to represent reits to buySource: ShutterstockVornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) is a commercial real estate stock with heavily-concentrated exposure to office space across New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. The thesis with this one is simple – it makes sense to sell VNO stock, due to the reasonable concerns around the commercial real estate sector, and indications a potential collapse could be underway.The company is sending out alarm signals that investors would be wise to yield. Vornado Realty Trust announced that it will be postponing dividend payments until the end of 2023. There’s little indication that it will restart paying dividends at that point. Unfortunately, the firm’s dividend was one of the primary reasons to own its stock. Previously, VNO stock paid out a whopping 11% yield. But that’s the bargain investors will face in the REITs space – the riskiest options will pay out the riskiest dividends, which could get cut when times get tough.Further, Vornado’s net income declined five-fold in Q1. All of the signs are screaming loudly and clearly that Vornado Realty Trust is in deep trouble, and investors would therefore be wise to stay far away.Consolidated Edison (ED)Con Edison electricity gas and steam power company truck vehicle van parked on Manhattan street.Source: BrandonKleinPhoto / Shutterstock.comConsolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) is an interesting stock simply because it should be much less risky. It is a utility company ,and utility companies are generally low risk. Yet, there are signals that Consolidated Edison shares are likely to move downward for the foreseeable future.For one, the company’s share price and analyst ratings are mismatched. Analysts are underweight the stock, yet ED shares trade above the average analyst target price. In short, analysts covering the company believe it should be priced lower than it currently is.The company sent a seemingly contradictory message in its May earnings report for Q1. Management boasted about investing in the clean energy future, while simultaneously selling off the firm’s clean energy business. While that led to strong earnings during the period it’s also difficult to reconcile the message. Is Consolidated Edison going to bring green energy to New York City or not? The company is a sell not necessarily because of this clear contradiction, but also because it is poorly-rated and overbought.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

So, when we ran our eye over Amphenol's (NYSE:APH) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Amphenol is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.20 = US$2.6b ÷ (US$15b - US$2.4b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, Amphenol has an ROCE of 20%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 13% earned by companies in a similar industry.

If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is Amphenol's ROCE Trending?Amphenol deserves to be commended in regards to it's returns. The company has consistently earned 20% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 79% in that time. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If Amphenol can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.The Bottom LineAmphenol has demonstrated its proficiency by generating high returns on increasing amounts of capital employed, which we're thrilled about. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 94% return if they held over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.Story continuesOn a separate note, we've found   1 warning sign for Amphenol   you'll probably want to know about.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

""So the commitments that businesses are going to make on Monday are absolutely essential.”She says 110 million people have been displaced worldwide, with an estimated 12 million from Ukraine, nearly half of whom are living in Europe after the continent's largest movement of refugees since World War II.The hiring push in Europe was organized by the Tent Partnership for Refugees, a nonprofit founded by Chobani CEO Hamdi Ulukaya that connects businesses and refugees, and is being unveiled at a gathering in Paris. The group's first summit in the U.S. last year led to commitments to hire 22,725 refugees.In the new round, Amazon leads the pack, vowing to hire at least 5,000 refugees over the next three years in Europe, followed by Marriott and Hilton with 1,500 each, Starbucks and ISS with 1,000 each, and smaller commitments from brands like Adidas, Starbucks, L’Oreal, PepsiCo and Hyatt.“This is good for us as a company because the opportunity to add diversity to our workforce will continue to make us a stronger company,"" said Ofori Agboka, Amazon vice president overseeing human resources. ""With diversity brings innovation, creativity, different insights.”He said the vast majority of jobs will be hourly roles at fulfillment and storage centers and in transport and delivery.Story continuesAmazon announced 27,000 job cuts earlier this year, part of a wave of layoffs after tech companies ramped up hiring during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those layoffs primarily affected salaried office jobs, Agboka said.Daria Sedihi-Volchenko fled Kyiv last year and now works in Warsaw, Poland, as a senior program manager for an Amazon Web Services program providing free tech training for Ukrainians. She says about 40% of those in the program have no tech background.“I went through the same way as many of our learners ... are going through,” she said. “I had to learn, and I took a commitment on my interview. I said that ‘OK, if we can agree and I can start working for you, I promise to learn Polish and I promise to learn technical skills.’”More than a year ago, Sedihi-Volchenko woke up to explosions from Russia's invasion.“I was terrified.

""And so we are hiring aggressively to make sure we can accommodate our guests as demand ramps up.”Marriott's jobs will largely be hourly positions like housekeepers, kitchen staff and front desk attendants.European nations have welcomed Ukrainians, and while Clements applauded opening schools, workplaces and other opportunities to them, she said the same should be offered to others fleeing conflict and crises in places like Syria, Sudan and Afghanistan.Sedihi-Volchenko knows the challenges ahead for refugees, even as some companies offer help with language skills, counseling and training.

71,ae70930a-7494-303f-b81e-66ce53717a6b,MAR,2023-06-19,"Institutional firms are pulling back from the U.S. housing market—just look at Starwood’s decision to shop 2,000 single-family rentals",Fortune,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/institutional-firms-pulling-back-u-212534339.html,1687123534,STORY,"['MAR', 'AMH', 'INVH']","[Starwood Capital CEO Barry Sternlicht doesn't hold back on his Federal Reserve criticism: On multiple occasions he's told CNBC anchors that the central bank's aggressive interest rate hikes could soon spur a deep recession.It's easy to see why Sternlicht is so openly critical of the Fed: Starwood primarily invests in real estate, where the Fed's interest rate hikes have already caused a great deal of economic pain.Last week, Bloomberg reported that Starwood Real Estate Income Trust plans to shop more than 2,000 single-family rentals. Starwood—which declined Fortune's interview request—hasn't publicly explained its motive for pulling back from the residential housing market, where its REIT owns over 3,200 single-family homes. That said, it's clear that the decision to shop these 2,000 homes comes as Starwood faces an uptick in redemption requests and endures pain in the commercial real estate sector.At first glance, one might assume Wall Street types would pull back from the commercial real estate space—where office values are sinking fast—and instead pile into the residential housing market—where national home values are rising again after passing through a mild home price correction last fall.However, institutional firms are also timid on the residential front. According to an analysis conducted by John Burns Research and Consulting, institutional investors—those owning over 1,000 homes—bought 90% fewer homes in January and February than they did in the first two months of 2022.Why are institutional investors pulling back so fast from the U.S. housing market?It boils down to the fact that the financial return on each additional home added just isn't that great right now after factoring in interest rates, house prices, and rents. Not to mention, some big investors like Yieldstreet think that national house prices, despite jumping a bit this spring, are poised for another step down.Story continues“We’re pretty much on pause across all [homebuying] strategies,"" Tejas Joshi, director of single-family residential at Yieldstreet, which owns over 700 single-family homes, recently told Fortune. ""I don’t think [house] prices have bottomed yet… On average, we have another 5% decline nationally, and it’ll vary by market. Peak-to-trough, [we’re expecting] 12% to 15% [national] decline.""View this interactive chart on Fortune.comNot only are institutional investors buying fewer homes, some are reducing their overall single-family portfolios.Look no further than Invitation Homes, the largest owner of U.S. single-family rental homes, which recently became a net seller. In the first quarter of 2023, Invitation Homes bought 194 homes while it sold off 297.A year earlier, in the first quarter of 2022, Invitation Homes—which Blackstone helped to grow before divesting in 2019—bought 822 single-family homes and sold off only 147.View this interactive chart on Fortune.comInvitation Homes isn't alone: American Homes 4 Rent was also a net seller in the first quarter.In the first quarter of 2023, American Homes 4 Rent sold off more single-family homes (666) than it bought (312). That net decline saw the Las Vegas–based company's portfolio shrink from 58,993 rental homes across the country to 58,639 homes.A year earlier, in the first quarter of 2022, American Homes 4 Rent bought 1,131 homes and only sold off 171 homes.Want to stay updated on the housing market?

The film opened in just three major international markets and will expand to other countries in the coming weeks.""The Flash,"" the latest DC superhero movie from Warner Bros , also underwhelmed at the box office. It topped the domestic charts with an estimated $55.1 million, according to researcher ComScore, at the low end of pre-weekend forecasts.Analysts had predicted that ""Elemental"" would open with at least $31 million at domestic theaters. The $30 million estimate, which will be finalized on Monday, would rank just ahead of the $29.1 million for 1995's ""Toy Story,"" Pixar's first movie. ""Toy Story"" became a global blockbuster that spawned multiple hit sequels.The studio is looking to rebound from the box office disappointment of its 2022 release ""Lightyear,"" the origin story of ""Toy Story"" hero Buzz Lightyear. The movie brought in an earthbound $226.7 million in global ticket sales, a fraction of the $1 billion take for 2019's ""Toy Story 4.""The director and producer of ""Lightyear"" were laid off last month, Reuters first reported, as Disney shed 7,000 jobs across the company in a cost-cutting effort.""Elemental"" is set in Element City, where Fire, Water, Earth and Air characters live together. An unexpected friendship between Fire and Water borrows from director Peter Sohn’s relationship with his Italian-American wife, which he initially hid from his parents.Story continuesTony Chambers, head of theatrical distribution at Disney, said he was disappointed by the domestic ticket sales for ""Elemental,"" which received positive feedback from movie critics and audiences and was heavily marketed. Audiences gave the film an ""A"" rating in polling by CinemaScore.Chambers noted that both live-action and animated films based on original stories and characters have struggled at theaters since the COVID-19 pandemic. Franchises based on well-known intellectual property (IP), such as current hit ""Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,"" are drawing mass audiences.""Original IP has a harder time cutting through in the market,"" Chambers said. ""At this point in time, it's a very busy marketplace.""During the pandemic, former Chief Executive Bob Chapek decided to release three Pixar movies - ""Soul,"" ""Luca"" and ""Turning Red"" - exclusively on the Disney+ streaming service.That taught audiences to expect Pixar movies would be available to watch at home, said Jeff Bock, senior box office analyst at Exhibitor Relations Co.At theaters, ""they're going to go back to the drawing board, and in this case what the drawing board means is sequels,"" Bock said, pointing to next year's ""Inside Out 2"" and the planned ""Toy Story 5.""

Start your 7-day trial to get on board.Federal court temporarily halts Microsoft-Activision buyoutA federal court in California ruled in favor of a request from U.S. antitrust regulators to place a temporary block on the completion of Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) $69 billion merger with Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:NASDAQ:ATVI).The Federal Trade Commission has argued that the deal, the largest ever in the video games industry, would grant Microsoft the ability and a heightened incentive to restrict Activision's content in ways that significantly reduce competition - a viewpoint that the two companies disagree with.In early December, the FTC, responsible for enforcing antitrust law, had already approached an in-house administrative judge to block the transaction on antitrust grounds. Their contention was that it would grant Microsoft's Xbox exclusive access to Activision games, leaving Nintendo consoles and Sony's (NYSE:SONY) PlayStation at a disadvantage.Despite the news, Microsoft shares were up 5.5% for the week; Activision ticked up fractionally.Broadcom/VMware $61B deal likely receives EU approval VMware (NYSE:VMW) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) shares surged 4% and 6% last Monday after Reuters reported that Broadcom is likely to receive conditional approval from the EU antitrust authority for its planned purchase of VMware, citing sources familiar with the matter.The approval from the European Commission is contingent upon Broadcom implementing measures to ensure interoperability with competitors, sources said.Both Broadcom and the EU antitrust watchdog declined to provide any comments on the matter.Story continuesiRobot stock jumps 21% after UK CMA approves Amazon’s acquisition The U.K. Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) approved Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) $1.7 billion acquisition of iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT), after which iRobot shares jumped more than 21% on Friday.After an investigation, the CMA has determined that the deal does not raise competition concerns in the U.K. However, the acquisition is still under review by regulators in other jurisdictions. The U.S. FTC has requested documents from both companies to further assess the purpose and rationale of the deal. iRobot has stated that the companies will cooperate with the FTC investigation, which typically takes about a year.Nasdaq agrees to buy Adenza for $10.5BNasdaq Inc. (NASDAQ:NDAQ) said it inked a deal to acquire Adenza, which provides risk management and regulatory software to the financial services industry, from private equity giant Thoma Bravo.The deal, will have Nasdaq pay $5.75B cash and 85.6 million common shares, or approximately $10.5B total. Nasdaq says the deal will help accelerate ""Nasdaq’s strategic vision to become the trusted fabric of the world’s financial system.""The stock part of the consideration represents approximately 14.9% of Nasdaq's total outstanding shares, and will make Thoma Bravo a strategic shareholder of the company.Shares of Nasdaq lost some 1.8% for the week.Patterson-UTI to combine with NexTier in merger of equalsPatterson-UTI Energy (NASDAQ:PTEN) shares jumped more than 12% on Thursday following the announcement that it had entered into a merger agreement with NexTier Oilfield Solutions (NYSE:NEX) to combine in an all-stock merger of equals.Under the terms of the $5.4B deal, NexTier shareholders will receive 0.7520 shares of Patterson-UTI common stock for each share of NexTier common stock.

Many speculative stocks are shooting up. New investment themes such as artificial intelligence are generating attention, and bullishness is running rampant. That’s all fine and well, but the macroeconomic backdrop remains challenging. As such, it could be a good time to look at these undervalued stable blue-chip stocks as a safer investment.It sometimes pays to play defense when other traders are starting to get greedy. Whether or not the recent bull run continues, these solid blue-chip buys will keep on humming.As another perk, these high-yield blue-chip stocks all offer dividend yields of at least 4% today. That gives investors a steady paycheck from these holdings regardless of what happens within the broader market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPfizer (PFE)blue Pfizer logo on the windows of a corporate building PFR stockSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.comPharmaceutical giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) is in a bit of an odd place right now. The firm saw its revenues more than double in recent years thanks to its successful development of various Covid-19 vaccines and therapeutics.Now that demand has sharply declined for Covid-19 related products, however, Pfizer’s revenues and profits have dropped. Unsurprisingly, Pfizer stock has fallen in-line with its reduced revenues.The funny thing, however, is that Pfizer stock is now merely flat since the initial onset of the pandemic back in 2020. Though revenues decline, Pfizer is far larger now than it was in 2019. Specifically, Pfizer earned $41 billion in revenues in 2019. The company is expected, by contrast, to earn $68 billion in revenues in both 2023 and 2024.Clearly, Pfizer has enjoyed a great deal of growth outside of just Covid-19 vaccines. Shares are going for just 12 times forward earnings and offer a 4.2% dividend yield. Investors have overreacted to the decline in pandemic-related revenues, making PFE stock a blue-chip bargain today.Unilever (UL)The blue Unilever sign next to the desk inside de head office in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.Source: BYonkruud / Shutterstock.comStory continuesUnilever (NYSE:UL) is a leading multinational consumer staples company. It primarily focuses on food and consumer wellness with product lines including nutritional products, ice creams, beauty, personal care, and cleaning supplies.Unilever had been fairly stagnant in recent years, with revenues coming in flat prior to 2020. Since then, however, things have inflected upward, with the company’s revenues jumping from $58 billion in 2019 to more than $64 billion last year.The company has seen some pressures on the cost side with the recent waves of inflation and supply chain issues throughout the economy. However, these issues appear to be letting up as commodity prices start to normalize. Analysts see steady mid-single digits earnings growth in the years to come, and that’s not bad for a firm starting out at just 17 times forward earnings in a defensive recession-proof industry.There is also a catalyst for change. When activist investors forced out the firm’s prior CEO, Unilever announced that Hein Schumacher will become the new CEO starting in July 2023. Schumacher previously headed a large dairy company and could give Unilever a fresh perspective and business strategy.Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) is the largest publicly-traded self-storage real estate investment Trust (REIT) in the country.Self-storage is an interesting asset class. Unlike most REITs, self-storage can thrive during times of economic uncertainty. In 2009, for example, self-storage stocks such as PSA did comparatively well. This makes sense as the rash of foreclosures and economic volatility caused many to move from one housing situation to another.Demographics are also at play. The millennial generation is entering their prime years for settling down and establishing their households. This may lead to a lot of moving around and a reliance on Public Storage units in the interims. As if that weren’t enough, hybrid work and e-commerce are both creating additional demand for storage space.Public Storage should be in fine shape regardless of a potential recession. That being the case, it’s somewhat surprising that PSA stock has fallen by a third from its peak. The firm should be holding up better than most of its REIT peers. However, due to this steep sell-off, PSA stock is back to 17 times forward funds from operations (FFO) and offers a 4.1% dividend yield.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in UL stock.

Intel confirmed the company’s “intention to expand manufacturing capacity in Israel,” where it is already active, but didn’t specify the terms or provide other details.The facility will be for wafer fabrication, a segment in which Israel is already one of Intel’s four major providers, according to a person familiar with the plans who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly.The expansion will further an effort by Intel Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger to locate more manufacturing outside of Asia, which dominates chip production. He’s also striving to restore the chip pioneer’s technological leadership after companies like Nvidia Corp. and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. eclipsed its capabilities.While Netanyahu put the value of the deal at $25 billion, which he said was the largest foreign investment in Israel and an “expression of confidence” in the nation’s economy, the person familiar said the total included a previous, $10 billion investment announced in 2021.Read More: Intel, Micron Spending Spree Shows Diplomacy Bearing FruitAccording to Israeli officials, the project will add thousands of jobs to the almost 12,000 workers now employed by Intel in the country. The new plant — to join an existing one in Kiryat Gat, south of Tel Aviv — is slated to begin operations by 2027 and remain active until at least 2035, the ministry said. As part of the agreement, Intel will pay a 7.5% tax rate in Israel instead of the 5% it pays now.Story continuesSunday’s announcement caps a busy time for the chip industry. Intel on Friday announced a $4.6 billion facility in Wroclaw, Poland. Another US chipmaker, Micron Technology Inc., is close to an agreement to commit at least $1 billion toward setting up a semiconductor packaging factory in India, Bloomberg News reported the same day, citing people familiar with the matter. The development plans highlight the global race to diversify supplies of critical components amid US tensions with China.Read More: Micron Nears $1 Billion Investment in India Chip Packaging PlantCompanies are also taking advantage of subsidies from foreign governments eager to make sure the supply of chips in their own territories is safe and attracts jobs. As part of the agreement with Israel, Intel is likely to be eligible for a significant government grant representing 12.8% of its total investment.The US is doling out roughly $52 billion in incentives as part of the Chips and Science Act passed last year. And Europe is making a similar effort. Intel is set to receive almost $11 billion in subsidies from the German government for a chip manufacturing complex in the eastern part of the country, Bloomberg reported last week.The company also continues to expand in Leixlip, Ireland, spending an additional 12 billion euros ($13 billion). It plans to double the manufacturing space there to bring so-called Intel 4 process technology to Europe and offer more foundry services — contract production for other companies. Once complete, this expansion will bring Intel’s total investment in Ireland to more than 30 billion euros.Intel’s Gelsinger is making bold expansion bets at a time when the storied chipmaker is struggling. The personal computer market is mired in a slump, and the company’s peers have pushed into its lucrative data-center turf. Nvidia, whose chips help power artificial intelligence computing, is now the star of the semiconductor industry. After passing Intel in market capitalization in 2020, Nvidia now has a valuation of more than $1 trillion — compared with about $150 billion for Intel.In Israel, Intel also has been working to complete the acquisition of the country’s Tower Semiconductor Ltd., a deal announced more than a year ago. Intel is counting on that $5.4 billion transaction to help bolster its position in the chip foundry industry — where TSMC dominates.Intel has been operating in Israel since 1974 and has R&amp;D centers in Haifa, Jerusalem, Yakum and Petah Tikva, as well as an existing factory in Kiryat Gat, which the company calls its “most advanced manufacturing facility.” Intel’s Jerusalem facility is the global development center for Mobileye, its autonomous driving business.Read More: Intel, Micron Spending Spree Shows Diplomacy Bearing FruitSanta Clara, California-based Intel said its intention to expand “is driven by our commitment to meeting future manufacturing needs and supporting Intel’s IDM 2.0 strategy, and we appreciate the continued support of the Israeli government.”The strategy, unveiled after Gelsinger took the helm in 2021, was touted as an “evolution of Intel’s integrated device manufacturing model” that would see the company become a provider of foundry capacity in the US and Europe, as well as an expanded use of external foundries for some of its products.--With assistance from Debby Wu, Jillian Deutsch and Gwen Ackerman.(Updates with more on CEO’s plans in third paragraph.)Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekRace-Based Affirmative Action Is Over.

But the long term shareholders of Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. (NYSE:FIS) have had an unfortunate run in the last three years. Sadly for them, the share price is down 59% in that time. And over the last year the share price fell 40%, so we doubt many shareholders are delighted.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. Check out our latest analysis for Fidelity National Information Services There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over the three years that the share price declined, Fidelity National Information Services' earnings per share (EPS) dropped significantly, falling to a loss. This was, in part, due to extraordinary items impacting earnings. Due to the loss, it's not easy to use EPS as a reliable guide to the business. But it's safe to say we'd generally expect the share price to be lower as a result!The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Fidelity National Information Services' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Fidelity National Information Services, it has a TSR of -57% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market gained around 20% in the last year, Fidelity National Information Services shareholders lost 39% (even including dividends). However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 8% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 1 warning sign  with Fidelity National Information Services , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.Fidelity National Information Services is not the only stock insiders are buying.

The delivery price of a Big Mac would rise to 590 yen ($4.16) from 540 yen, it said in a press release.The yen has fallen to 141.81 to the dollar, from around 133 at the beginning of the year.($1 = 141.8000 yen)(Reporting by Anton Bridge, Editing by Chang-Ran Kim and Angus MacSwan)]"

Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. That's why when we briefly looked at McDonald's' (NYSE:MCD) ROCE trend, we were very happy with what we saw.Understanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for McDonald's, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.22 = US$11b ÷ (US$52b - US$4.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Thus, McDonald's has an ROCE of 22%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Hospitality industry average of 9.1%. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for McDonald's compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.So How Is McDonald's' ROCE Trending?It's hard not to be impressed by McDonald's' returns on capital. The company has employed 53% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 22%. Returns like this are the envy of most businesses and given it has repeatedly reinvested at these rates, that's even better. You'll see this when looking at well operated businesses or favorable business models.In Conclusion...McDonald's has demonstrated its proficiency by generating high returns on increasing amounts of capital employed, which we're thrilled about. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 101% return they've received over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.Story continuesOne more thing, we've spotted   2 warning signs  facing McDonald's that you might find interesting.If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.Have feedback on this article?

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Coca-ColaIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman &amp; CEO, James Robert Quincey, sold US$9.6m worth of shares at a price of US$64.33 per share. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$61.67. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.In total, Coca-Cola insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insiders At Coca-Cola Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Coca-Cola shares. In total, insiders dumped US$12m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.Does Coca-Cola Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Coca-Cola insiders own about US$1.8b worth of shares (which is 0.7% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Coca-Cola Tell Us?Insiders haven't bought Coca-Cola stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Zooming out, the longer term picture doesn't give us much comfort. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. While conducting our analysis, we found that Coca-Cola has 2 warning signs and it would be unwise to ignore these.Of course Coca-Cola may not be the best stock to buy.

Better, the recent market turbulence has pushed some stocks to lower levels, presenting an opportune time to acquire them at discounted prices. Of course, among the group of overlooked stocks with potential, many investors focus on are value traps. Or, companies that appear cheap, or attractive, based on where they previously traded. However, for various fundamental or accurate reasons, such stocks often continue lower as investors look to other alternatives in given sectors.That said, there are certain companies I’d put in the overlooked stocks with potential bucket, particularly in sectors that haven’t benefited as much from certain growth trends such as AI right now. Here are three such overlooked stocks I think are worth considering right now.PAYXPaychex$113.09INTUIntuit$446.12WDAYWorkday$209.65InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPaychex (PAYX)man's hand holding wads of cash. stocks to buy. Stocks With 1000% UpsideSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comPaychex (NASDAQ:PAYX) is a software company specializing in HR services. Their offerings include payroll management, benefits administration, insurance services, and compliance support for businesses.In addition, Paychex will increase its quarterly dividend by 13% to 89 cents per share, starting with the May 2023 payment. This move will result in a $1.2 billion dividend payout to shareholders for fiscal year 2023. The company refrains from buying back its stock unless it’s for dilution purposes, with $327.1 million remaining for repurchase from its $400 million authorization.While PAYX stock has declined along with the broader market, there are factors to consider. For one, despite concerns of an economic slowdown, employment remains robust, with the U.S. unemployment rate at a low 3.5%. Two, labor demand remains high, and a temporary dip in economic output is unlikely to significantly impact the country’s favorable employment outlook.

Chief Executive Tony Douglas said the owners would impose strict financial expectations, which he did not specify.Douglas was speaking at an event to present the airline on the eve of the Paris Airshow. It is launching at a time when airlines are under pressure to meet industry emission targets, with some facing legal pressure over alleged greenwashing.""Ultimately it will be commercial aviation sustainability that will differentiate the winners and the losers, and anyone who doesn't take it seriously will probably fail for sure,"" Douglas said.The creation of a second Saudi national airline was announced alongside a provisional order for up to 72 Boeing 787s in March, as oil producer Saudi Arabia diversifies its economy.Douglas ruled out any further aircraft announcements at this week's show.However, industry sources said Riyadh Air was likely to sign a deal with General Electric for engines to power the recently ordered Dreamliners.Riyadh Air declined to comment. GE, which competes with Britain's Rolls-Royce to power the wide-body jets, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Douglas said Riyadh Air continued to conduct a contest between Airbus and Boeing for narrowbody jets.The airline plans to show a 787 this week painted in the airline's new indigo livery.Douglas declined to give details of the airline's cabin product which he said would be rolled out progressively.But he said it would involve an ""obsessional"" level of attention to detail, aided by systems to track passenger preferences closer to Amazon or Spotify than typical airlines.Story continuesRiyadh Air is launching flights in 2025 in a region whose carriers have well-established brands for high service levels.Qatar Airways last year won Skytrax airline of the year for the seventh year in a row and Emirates last month topped the Business Traveller Middle East awards for a tenth time.Douglas said it was easier to incorporate the latest digital customisation from scratch without starting with legacy systems. That echoes claims by Air India, whose systems are so antiquated that its new CEO has saidits relaunchamounts to a clean sheet.Asked whether Riyadh Air would serve alcohol in its cabins amid Saudi Arabia's strict laws on drinking, Douglas said the airline would always follow any laws that applied.

(NYSE:EL). The company's stock saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Estée Lauder Companies’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies Is Estée Lauder Companies Still Cheap?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 66.81x is currently well-above the industry average of 22.26x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Given that Estée Lauder Companies’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What kind of growth will Estée Lauder Companies generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. Estée Lauder Companies' earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? EL’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe EL should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on EL for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for EL, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Estée Lauder Companies as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

Indeed, scenario analysis can be important, to see how much downside potential certain holdings may have. And while predicting the future is essentially impossible, knowing which stocks are poised to plunge, if nothing changes, is important.One clear sign that things are not headed in the right direction for companies is deteriorating analyst ratings. Analysts aren’t great at predicting the future. However, they tend to work closely with companies, holding deep insights into the firms they are tasked with covering. This can help uncover unseen issues that more casual observers simply cannot.In any case, the stocks below do suffer from weakening ratings. Worsening ratings often coincide with problematic fundamentals. Those too are present in the shares represented below.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWFCWells Fargo$41.58VNOVornado Realty Trust$15.61EDConsolidated Edison$92.61Wells Fargo (WFC)Wells Fargo (WFC) bank sign in yellow and red with wagon logo. The sign is flanked by tall grassSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comWells Fargo (NYSE:WFC) is the fourth largest bank in the United States. For that reason, it might be surprising to find the company on this list of stocks to sell. Indeed, in the wake of the regional banking collapse, investors fled to larger banks for their perceived safety. Wells Fargo certainly benefited from that trend, improving the bank’s fundamentals in the near-term.Additionally, Wells Fargo’s fundamentals have shown relatively consistent improvement over the past quarter, overall. Revenues grew, net income increased, all while the bank increased provisional losses as risks became more evident. None of these factors suggests that Wells Fargo is particularly worthy of selling. Nor have analysts soured on WFC stock recently.However, the problem is that Wells Fargo is arguably the least-trusted major bank, and that’s saying something. In December the company was ordered to pay $2 billion in order to redress improper home foreclosures, illegally repossessed vehicles, and improper fees. The judgment also included a $1.7 billion civil penalty. The company has a history of problems, which is why I would sell it despite the perception that it’s a good bank due to its size. There are simply too many other great options in this sector to buy right now.Story continuesVornado Realty Trust (VNO)a person in a suit holds a tiny house to represent reits to buySource: ShutterstockVornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) is a commercial real estate stock with heavily-concentrated exposure to office space across New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. The thesis with this one is simple – it makes sense to sell VNO stock, due to the reasonable concerns around the commercial real estate sector, and indications a potential collapse could be underway.The company is sending out alarm signals that investors would be wise to yield. Vornado Realty Trust announced that it will be postponing dividend payments until the end of 2023. There’s little indication that it will restart paying dividends at that point. Unfortunately, the firm’s dividend was one of the primary reasons to own its stock. Previously, VNO stock paid out a whopping 11% yield. But that’s the bargain investors will face in the REITs space – the riskiest options will pay out the riskiest dividends, which could get cut when times get tough.Further, Vornado’s net income declined five-fold in Q1. All of the signs are screaming loudly and clearly that Vornado Realty Trust is in deep trouble, and investors would therefore be wise to stay far away.Consolidated Edison (ED)Con Edison electricity gas and steam power company truck vehicle van parked on Manhattan street.Source: BrandonKleinPhoto / Shutterstock.comConsolidated Edison (NYSE:ED) is an interesting stock simply because it should be much less risky. It is a utility company ,and utility companies are generally low risk. Yet, there are signals that Consolidated Edison shares are likely to move downward for the foreseeable future.For one, the company’s share price and analyst ratings are mismatched. Analysts are underweight the stock, yet ED shares trade above the average analyst target price. In short, analysts covering the company believe it should be priced lower than it currently is.The company sent a seemingly contradictory message in its May earnings report for Q1. Management boasted about investing in the clean energy future, while simultaneously selling off the firm’s clean energy business. While that led to strong earnings during the period it’s also difficult to reconcile the message. Is Consolidated Edison going to bring green energy to New York City or not? The company is a sell not necessarily because of this clear contradiction, but also because it is poorly-rated and overbought.On the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

To clarify, I’m not calling for an imminent collapse. Rather, the point is to be prepared ahead of time in case circumstances go awry.While the economy added more jobs than anticipated, it’s important to point out that the number of people unemployed for 15 to 26 weeks increased by 179,000 to 858,000. As CNN stated, the data may indicate that it’s taking longer for people to find work. Given the layoffs that continue to this day, it’s not a bad idea to consider safe stocks for recession.On a more tactical note, the correction that the cryptocurrency market suffered recently suggests that risk-on sentiment may be fading. To avoid bidding up overheated ideas, investors may want to consider the below defensive stocks for recession.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsCOSTCostco$520.97AWKAmerican Water Works$146.03BGBunge$93.79Recession-Proof Stocks: Costco (COST)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7For Costco (NASDAQ:COST), its inclusion as one of the best recession-proof stocks to buy centers on its core consumer demographic. Essentially, Costco members make more money (presumably because they’re more educated) and happen to be younger than some of their big-box retailer counterparts. Put another way, the warehouse-style retailer can grow with its consumer. Thanks to the higher average income, they’re also more insulated economically.Plus, another reason why COST ranks among the best stocks for economic downturn focuses on its operational resilience. On a per-share basis, Costco’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 14%, above nearly 80% of its peers. Also, its EBITDA growth rate during the same period comes in at 15.4%, above 65.6% of sector rivals.As well, Costco enjoys consistent profitability. Its trailing-year net margin stands at 2.55%, beating out 61.72% of its competitors. Overall, it’s one of the stocks to buy before a recession thanks to a higher degree of predictability.Story continuesAmerican Water Works (AWK)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comPrimarily for American Water Works (NYSE:AWK), the inclusion of the entity on this list of recession-proof stocks is all about natural monopolies. As a utility firm providing water management services, American Water organically commands a steep barrier to entry. Therefore, would-be competitors don’t even try. In fairness, AWK slipped nearly 5% since the Jan. opener.However, the red ink could allow a relative discount for one of the defensive stocks for recession. Admittedly, the financials don’t seem that enticing. For example, the company’s balance sheet seems rough, particularly with a low cash-to-debt ratio of 0.02 times. Also, AWK trades at a forward multiple of 30.65, which stands on the high side.That said, American Water also benefits from a captive or hostage audience. With the aforementioned natural monopoly, its consumers have little choice but to pay up. Unsurprisingly, then, one of AWK’s core strengths lies in its consistent profitability and an ultra-high net margin of 21.4%. Cynically, then, it’s one of the top safe stocks for recession.Bunge (BG)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comFinally, Bunge (NYSE:BG) makes the list of recession-proof stocks to buy because of an unignorable reality. No matter how advanced we become as a civilization, we will always need nutritional sustenance. As an agribusiness and food company, Bunge basically benefits from permanent relevancy. Now, that doesn’t mean it’s always a top buy. However, it’s a great idea to pick up if you anticipate a downturn.Yes, so far this year, BG slipped 2% and on a trailing-year basis, it’s down nearly 9%. Frankly, the red ink won’t change the thesis that if the market favors risk-off assets, BG would be one of the best stocks for an economic downturn.As well, the softness in the charts makes Bunge undervalued. Presently, the market prices BG at a forward multiple of 8.35. As a discount to projected earnings, Bunge ranks better than 88.84% of the competition. Also, it’s worth pointing out that the company features a three-year revenue growth rate of 14.7%, outflanking 73.86% of its peers. Also, its book growth rate pings at 18.7%, above 81.36% of rivals.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

But demand is exploding worldwide as automakers gear up to churn out electric vehicles to cut greenhouse gas emissions. The country sits on top of the world's largest known deposits of lithium and Boric's announcement in April gave Codelco responsibility for negotiating deals with new companies as well as current lithium miners Albemarle and SQM .The goal is to get the companies to enter voluntary state-controlled partnership before their existing contracts expire. At the same time, Codelco wants to boost its output of copper which has slumped to its lowest in a quarter-century.Some analysts have questioned whether the copper company with no experience as a lithium miner can tackle both challenges at once. But industry insiders told Reuters Codelco will probably focus its own resources on copper while negotiating contracts for lithium operations and letting other miners do the work.""It could be Codelco only contributes capital,"" said one of the sources with knowledge of executive decision making, a strategy which could see the state firm hold a majority stake in future projects but leave operations to private partners.Chile could end up recreating the model Indonesia used with Freeport-McMoRan, where the firm gave up majority control to the state but remained the operator, a former Codelco senior executive said.""Codelco can resolve the lithium issue with relatively few people,"" added the person, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the ongoing talks. ""Codelco may have 51% but I don't think it will be the operator.""Story continuesLithium, evaporated from brine ponds in Chile's high-altitude salt flats, is coveted by Tesla, BMW and every other global car maker. It is also sought by governments from Berlin to Beijing, that need it to power the shift to renewable energy.Two Codelco sources with knowledge of resource planning and strategy said the lithium units were being run by compact teams and there was no plan for major hiring as talks with SQM and Albemarle moved forward.The sources said the lithium strategy was being led by executives including Jaime San Martin, manager of new business development, known by some within Codelco as ""lithium man"". Finance VP Alejandro Rivera is also closely involved.BALANCING COPPER AND LITHIUMCodelco Chairman Maximo Pacheco told Reuters that while the firm had set up two lithium subsidiaries Salares de Chile and Minera Tarar, it would first see how talks went before making any recruitment drives.""Based on that and the progress of the negotiations we're having to build these public-private alliances, we're going to define the organization of human and capital resources,"" he said on the sidelines of an event near capital Santiago.Codelco has already started talks with SQM, whose existing lithium contract expires in 2030. Albemarle has said it is waiting to begin negotiations until closer to its contract's expiration date in 2043.Pacheco and other executives said lithium plans would not weigh on copper, but outside experts were skeptical.Juan Carlos Guajardo, head of consultancy Plusmining, said building up Codelco's lithium expertise from almost zero would nonetheless take up resources.""The agreements will require high involvement of top management as they are strategic decisions,"" Guajardo said. ""But I think lithium is an excellent opportunity for Codelco to help them navigate their very difficult copper situation.""Codelco must also revive production of the red metal that has flagged to a 25-year low. Challenges keep mounting as the Andre Sougarret, the company's CEO, suddenly resigned last Tuesday, citing ""complexities"" within the company.

The update resolves a software flaw that allowed drivers to dismiss warnings of an unsecured door, according to Elektrek.The notice also shared the number of units covered by the recall: a total of 36.The number aligns with the number of trucks PepsiCo currently says they own. “We have the 15 in Modesto that we’re launching...and then we have 21 in Sacramento,” Mike O’Connell, Pepsi’s vice-president for supply chain, told CNBC in February.Last week’s recall is the second involving the Tesla Semi. In mid-March, the NHTSA issued a notice covering 35 units produced between Nov. 30 and Feb. 28. Elektrek notes that the two recall notices implies that Tesla managed to produce just one truck in the 15-day window.It’s possible Tesla produced Semis not covered in the recall notice, and that the company has ramped up production since mid-March. Yet the numbers suggest that the company is far from its original target of 50,000 trucks produced in North America by the end of 2024.(To compare, companies bought 254,000 ""Class 8"" vehicles—a category of heavy truck that includes the Tesla Semi—in the U.S. in 2022, according to the National Automobile Dealers Association.)Story continuesTesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Tesla produced almost 441,000 cars globally in the first quarter of 2023.The company is investing more in truck production, spending $3.6 billion to expand its facilities in its Nevada Gigafactory. A new production line in Nevada plans to produce five trucks a week, reported Elektrek in March.Yet Musk himself is downplaying his earlier target for Semi production. At a conference in Texas last week, the Tesla CEO forecast that the carmaker won’t be able to make large volumes of the Semi until the end of next year. He cited issues with battery supply.“The future is a massive increase in electricity demand, and it’s going to take everything that we’ve got just to keep up with it,” he said.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

115,26d6bb19-19fc-34a0-8abd-f0abf668ac82,PEP,2023-06-19,3 Stocks That Are Screaming Buys as Inflation Slows Down,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-screaming-buys-inflation-110029758.html,1686654029,STORY,"['TGT', 'AAPL', 'PEP']","[This is certainly not a market many would categorize as one with numerous screaming buys to go after. Indeed, the macro backdrop remains uncertain, with geopolitical tensions high and a Federal Reserve intent on keeping interest rates high to battle inflation. That said, the Fed’s fight against inflation is resulting in some ground being gained, and stocks to buy amid slowing inflation. In fact, right now, many inflation metrics are coming down. Plus, considering the lagging effect of some of the data, it’s possible we could actually be in the midst of a lower-inflation environment. Thus, it actually may be possible for the unicorn-like soft landing to really take place, given the strength of the labor market of late.Restrictive monetary policy has hampered demand, though the supply of many goods in the economy remains tight. This has led to a rather robust period, relative to expert expectations, of late. If this continues, and inflation continues to move in the right direction, there are some stocks I’d call screaming buys right now. Here are three stocks to buy amid slowing inflation I have an eye on.PEPPepsiCo$181.90TGTTarget$126.48AAPLApple$183.79InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsPepsiCo (PEP)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) has managed to post substantial revenue increases in recent quarters. This is impressive, considering the company’s established position in a mature market. In April, management disclosed that organic revenue soared by 14% in Q1, prompting an upward revision of Pepsi’s 2023 sales forecast. Pepsi now anticipates an additional 8% revenue increase on top of last year’s 14% surge.Despite a slight decline in overall sales volumes, higher prices for snacks and beverages contributed to positive performance. Food segment volume decreased by 3%, while beverage volume increased by 1%. CEO Ramon Laguarta expressed satisfaction, highlighting the resilience of Pepsi’s categories and geographies. Thus, inflation hasn’t impacted this consumer discretionary name as much as many expected. We all seem to want our inexpensive treats, and PepsiCo is a company that provides these in droves. Story continuesThe company also recently announced a 10% dividend increase and raised its full-year organic growth guidance. With a strong brand and an impressive track record of 51 consecutive years of increasing annual payouts, this food and beverage conglomerate presents an appealing investment opportunity. Dare I say it, this could be a screaming buy, if we see the so-called soft landing everyone is looking for materialize.Target (TGT)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comDespite being a prominent big-box retail giant, Target (NYSE:TGT) has experienced a contrasting performance compared to the soaring stock market. The company’s shares have decreased significantly during the previous week, losing nearly 8%.While Target has successfully decreased inventory levels, the company is currently encountering challenges from various angles. Inventory shrinkage, which includes theft, is anticipated to impact profits negatively by over $500 million this year. Additionally, according to an analyst from KeyBanc, the resumption of student loan payments later in the year might diminish the spending capacity of Target’s customer base.However, Target has experienced a remarkable increase in dividends of more than 150% during the previous ten years, together with a large decrease in the number of shares outstanding, leading to a steady rise in earnings per share. Target has maintained a phenomenal growth rate of over 40% over the past ten years notwithstanding an earlier fall in profitability, demonstrating its ability to operate well throughout times of slowing in the economy. Thus, this is more of a screaming buy in weak economic periods, putting this stock on my radar right now.Apple (AAPL)Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words ""buy"" and ""sell"" displayed on the screen.

See our latest analysis for Union Pacific What's The Opportunity In Union Pacific?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 13.10% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Union Pacific today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $180.96, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Union Pacific’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Union Pacific look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares.
