If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on navigating retirement living in the US, you may go to 5 Best Cities to Retire in the Midwest.', 'When retirement rolls around, so does a list - of often very pressing - questions. Among these, one of the most important is deciding the location of your retirement. Are you going to stay put? Move states? Or perhaps venture further and switch countries completely? What your answer to this question is will have a major influence on how your retirement years play out.\xa0', ""“Where you live could actually probably be the biggest retirement decision you make because of the differences in taxes in different states. When you're updating your numbers, not only think about updating your financial savings numbers, but think about spending. Spending is all about really making sure that you understand how the inflationary environment is impacting what your monthly spend is and what it'll be in the future.” -Rhian Horgan, CEO and Founder, Silvur, a retirement planning application. "", 'For a large section of American retirees, thinking about moving for retirement is already a top priority. CNBC reports findings from a recent AARP survey, stating that about 38% of Americans aged 50 and older have sought professional help when planning their retirement. Of the work that these professionals do, some of the key areas focus on financial planning and where - in terms of geography - an individual’s retirement savings would best pan out.\xa0', 'Some of the most popular investment management and financial planning companies that assist Americans on the road to retirement are The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Mercer International Inc. (NASDAQ:MERC), and BlackRock, Inc.(NYSE:BLK). While the way that these companies assist clients differs - for instance, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) offers clients a complimentary financial plan to aid with their retirement milestones, whereas Mercer International Inc. (NASDAQ:MERC) offers portfolio development - the end goal for each is to put the retiree in the best possible financial position.\xa0', 'For senior citizens who do decide to move for retirement, reaching this decision is only the first step. The next question that arises is where. While exact figures are not available, we know that upwards of 450,000 Americans have chosen to retire abroad - based on the number of Social Security payments that are being received outside of the United States, as reported by the Wall Street Journal.\xa0', 'Many more yet, decide to simply move cities and states for retirement. In 2023 alone, over 338,000 US residents moved within the country for retirement. These numbers, shared by Hire A Helper’s latest report on migration trends, depict a growing trend of venturing outside of one’s hometown when retirement comes knocking. While you might not think so, the main driving factor behind these moves is not simply the urge to explore a new place or get out and about.\xa0', 'Instead, it’s more practical pushing factors such as cost of living, weather, and even healthcare that often force an individual to think twice about where they are going to retire. Of course, America is vast, and making this decision can be nothing short of puzzling. The American Midwest continues to be a popular retirement destination with Iowa even being included in the most popular states to retire to in the US.\xa0', 'To facilitate present and future retirees in contemplating a retirement move to the Midwest, we have compiled the following list of the 15 best cities to retire in the Midwest.', 'Steven Frame / Shutterstock.com', 'To compile this list of the 15 best cities to retire in the Midwest, we consulted several sources including our list of 20 Best Cities to Retire for 2024, Kiplinger, GOBankingRates, Stacker, The Travel, and FinanceBuzz. The United States Census Bureau defines the following states as Midwestern: Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, and Wisconsin. Once a list of places was compiled using these sources, we then ranked them across multiple factors, namely, their average figure for a one-bedroom rental, their average monthly grocery bill for a single person, their livability scores, and their median house price. For this article, rental prices were taken from Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:Z) and Zumper, grocery figures were taken from the Economic Policy Institute, livability scores were taken from Area Vibes, and median house prices were taken from Redfin Corporation (NASDAQ:RDFN). Once these rankings were assigned, places that did not have one-bedroom rental listings were removed. A cumulative score was then assigned to each city, with the 15 highest-scoring cities making our list of the 15 best cities to retire in the Midwest.', 'For cities that gained an equal score, their rent figures were used as a tie-breaker. The resulting list is presented in ascending order, with the highest-ranked place being presented last.\xa0It is important to remember that personal preference plays a big part. The best course of action is to visit the place you plan to move to, converse with locals, take advice from a financial consultant, and only then make your final decision.\xa0', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

And it\'s true that you\'ll have to pay much more for quality businesses today than you would have shelled out back in early 2023.', 'That\'s the price an investor must pay for a brighter sentiment on Wall Street. As billionaire Warren Buffett pointed out in 2008, ""If you wait for the robins, spring will be over.""', 'Still, there are always relative values in the market, especially if your investing time frame stretches across decades. Let\'s look at two attractively priced ""tech"" stocks (see below for an explanation of why ""tech"" is in quotes).', ""Unlike software rival Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) isn't in the $3 trillion market valuation club right now. That's mainly because the iPhone maker's shares have underperformed the market by a wide margin in recent months. The stock is up just 16% in the past year compared to Microsoft's 66% spike."", 'That gap sets up a potentially attractive buying opportunity for patient investors.', ""Sure, Apple is going through a bit of a slump right now. Sales barely grew last quarter, rising just 2% year over year compared to Microsoft's 16% surge. Growth prospects don't look particularly encouraging for the next year or so, either. Most Wall Street pros are looking for about a 6% sales uptick next year following modest declines in fiscal 2024."", ""Consider the value you get from owning Apple during this time of elevated pessimism, though. The stock is valued at just 7 times annual sales compared to Microsoft's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 14. Apple prioritizes ample cash returns, too, with $27 billion heading directly to shareholders last quarter alone in the form of share buybacks and dividends."", ""These cash returns, which mainly arrive through buybacks, should continue helping earnings per share outpace sales growth in 2024 and beyond. That will be a nice buffer for shareholders as they wait for Apple's new product releases -- along with its push into more services -- to reaccelerate growth."", 'I know it might seem like a stretch to call Walmart (NYSE: WMT) a tech stock, but hear me out. The retailer just finished a fantastic year that saw e-commerce grow by 23% to cross $100 billion in annual sales. For context, Amazon grew its product sales by 5% in 2023, up to $256 billion; eBay reported $73 billion of annual sales volume.', ""Walmart is also getting more revenue growth from other tech sources like its surging digital advertising business. It's little surprise, then, that profit margins are rising. The chain achieved 10% higher operating income last year, outpacing Walmart's 6% revenue uptick."", 'Even with strong growth in its tech-focused segments, traditional retailing will be the main show at Walmart for the foreseeable future. The good news is that this division is firing on all cylinders, too. Customer traffic was up a healthy 4% year over year in the holiday period, customer satisfaction levels are rising, and the chain is snapping up market share in groceries and consumer discretionary products, including from higher-income shoppers.', ""You can own Walmart stock for a P/S below 1, or about the same valuation that you would pay for Target stock right now. That price seems like a great deal for a quickly growing e-commerce business that's supported by a dominant brick-and-mortar enterprise."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

In recent months, her plan to turn Under Armour around was becoming increasingly clear.', 'Linnartz added key talent to the roles of chief commercial officer, chief communications officer (one-time comms person to former PayPal CEO Dan Schulman), chief product officer, chief design officer (celebrated fashion designer John Varvatos), chief supply chain officer, president of Americas, president of EMEA, and chief marketing officer.', 'Her “Protect This House 3” strategy focused on improving product design, expanding in the lucrative athleisure market, and returning to growth in the US.

You can also take a detailed look at the 5 Countries with Most Personal Space.', 'In a world where personal space is often a precious commodity, understanding the dynamics of countries with the most generous allowances for personal space offers valuable insights into cultural norms, social behaviors, and even economic patterns. Personal space, defined as the physical distance individuals prefer to keep between themselves and others, varies significantly across different cultures and societies.', 'The concept of personal space is deeply intertwined with cultural norms and societal values. In countries where personal space is highly valued, such as Romania and Hungary, individuals tend to maintain a greater physical distance from others in social interactions. This preference reflects a cultural emphasis on autonomy, privacy, and mutual respect. Conversely, in cultures where personal space is less prioritized, such as South Korea and Mexico, people may feel more comfortable with closer proximity during interactions.', 'The allocation of personal space can also influence economic behavior and consumption patterns within a country. In cultures where personal space is highly valued, individuals may be more inclined to spend leisure time in spacious public areas, such as parks or gardens, rather than crowded urban spaces. This preference for open, uncluttered environments may also extend to recreational activities, with outdoor pursuits such as hiking or camping being particularly popular. Research from the Outdoor Industry Association shows that outdoor recreation contributes significantly to the economy, with outdoor recreation generating $459.8 billion in consumer spending in the United States alone in 2019.', 'Moreover, research tells that the allocation of personal space can have significant implications for economic behaviors and consumer preferences within a country. For instance, in countries where personal space is highly valued, individuals may prefer spacious living accommodations, leading to a higher demand for larger homes or apartments. This increased demand can stimulate the real estate market and drive property prices higher. Additionally, businesses in these countries may need to consider personal space preferences when designing retail spaces, ensuring that customers feel comfortable and respected during their shopping experiences.', 'For example, Real estate prices tend to be higher in countries where personal space is highly valued. According to the World Bank, the average price per square meter of an apartment in Canada is $4,709, reflecting the demand for spacious living accommodations. Similarly, luxury brands also often perform well in countries with a strong emphasis on personal space. According to a report by Bain & Company, global luxury goods sales reached €281 billion in 2019, with countries like Germany and Canada contributing significantly to this market.', 'A real estate investment trust, Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR), owns and operates over 78,000 apartment units across the United States, with an average occupancy rate of around 95%. In countries where personal space is highly valued, such as Canada and Germany, the average monthly rent for a one-bedroom apartment ranges from $1,000 to $2,000, reflecting the demand for spacious living accommodations. Consequently, Equity Residential (NYSE:EQR) experienced increased rental income, with estimated annual revenues ranging from $936 million to $1.87 billion from properties in these countries, due to the preference of more personal space.', 'Similarly, Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) shows that properties with more bedrooms, larger square footage, and ample outdoor space tend to command higher prices and experience faster sales. For example, in 2019, the average floor area of a newly built single-detached home in Canada was approximately 2,064 square feet, compared to 1,022 square feet for a condominium apartment. Real estate companies specializing in luxury properties or suburban developments catering to families seeking more personal space have seen strong performance in the Canadian market.\xa0', 'To shortlist the 20 Countries with Most Personal Space, we consulted the data from World Population Review and CEO World to gain information on countries with most personal space and to learn about the area in centimeters that people require for their personal space. The list of the 20 Countries with Most Personal Space has been ranked in ascending order – from countries with lesser space in centimeters to most personal space measured in centimeters.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

In South Korean society, respecting personal boundaries is considered important, reflecting values of dignity, autonomy, and mutual respect. Whether in crowded markets or tranquil parks, South Koreans maintain a respectful distance from others in social interactions, allowing individuals to feel comfortable and secure. This cultural norm fosters positive social dynamics and contributes to a sense of harmony within South Korean communities.', 'Preferred Personal Space: 98.89', 'Mexico, a vibrant and diverse country in North America, embraces a cultural preference for personal space, with a preferred distance of 98.89 centimeters. Mexicans value their privacy and tend to maintain a respectful distance from others in social interactions, whether in bustling markets or serene plazas. This preference reflects a cultural emphasis on individual autonomy and mutual respect. From lively fiestas to intimate gatherings, Mexicans navigate social interactions with warmth and hospitality, fostering positive social dynamics and contributing to a sense of community and belonging within diverse Mexican regions.', 'Preferred Personal Space: 99.01', 'Canada, known for its natural beauty, multiculturalism, and inclusivity, upholds a cultural preference for personal space, with a preferred distance of 99.01 centimeters. Canadians value their privacy and tend to maintain a respectful distance from others in social interactions, whether in bustling cities or remote wilderness areas. This preference reflects a cultural emphasis on individual autonomy and mutual respect. From friendly gatherings to outdoor adventures, Canadians navigate social interactions with a sense of consideration and inclusivity, fostering positive social dynamics and contributing to a sense of belonging within diverse Canadian communities.', 'Preferred Personal Space: 99.11', 'Brazil, a vibrant and diverse country in South America, values personal space despite its lively atmosphere, with a preferred distance of 99.11 centimeters.

Credit cards might seem like a quick fix for impulse buys, but pause for a second and think: Can you actually afford it? Will your next paycheck cover the fun splurge and your monthly bills too? Credit card companies can be slick – they thrive on your slip-ups and unnecessary spending. Watch out for those sky-high interest rates and tricky fine print that could trip you up in a flash. Stay savvy and steer clear of those credit card traps!', ""Hey there, when you're in your 30s, it's essential to take charge of your family's financial well-being. Your superannuation fund might have some insurance coverage, but it's crucial to figure out what YOU really need. Don't rely solely on default options – do your own research and tailor your insurance to fit your needs. Keep in mind that if you switch jobs and funds, you could lose your insurance, and getting new coverage might cost you more. Here's the kicker: getting long-term disability insurance is way cheaper in your 30s than later in life. So, if you're young and healthy, now's the time to lock in that personal insurance. Waiting until you're older or dealing with health issues could mean paying more or even getting turned down for coverage.

Take a second to think: does your tiny tot really need that high-end accessory?

Keep those emotions in check and make sure your spending matches your financial goals – for you and your little bundle of joy!"", ""When you're in your 30s, watch out for that sneaky consumer debt trap.

Many folks don't even realize the interest rates piling up, turning that $1,000 splurge into a $1,180 headache if you don't pay it off in full. Yikes!"", ""If you're drowning in debt, focus on wiping out the highest interest balances first or think about consolidating to a no-interest card to tackle that debt monster. The key?

In your 30s, it's key to watch where your cash is flowing. Mindless spending can really chip away at your wealth over time. Stick to spending less than you earn – that's the secret sauce to building up your bank balance. Keep an eye on your spending habits, track every penny for a month, and see where you can cut back. Avoid lifestyle creep – that temptation to spend more when you earn more. Instead, focus on striking a balance between enjoying life and saving for the future.

Stay focused on your own path and trust that good planning will get you where you want to be. Enjoy the ride and stay true to your own financial goals!"", ""Hey there in your 30s! If you're not feeling the love for your job or see stagnant growth ahead, it might be time for a career switch. You've got experience under your belt, making you a hot commodity in the job market. Update that resume, explore new opportunities, and get ready to negotiate for a bump in pay and more responsibility. It's your chance to gear up for your top earning years.

Experts always stress the importance of starting early to build that nest egg, aiming for the hefty $1.7 million that folks believe is the magic number by age 65. As Kaleb Paddock, a financial planner, points out, compound interest is your BFF in your 30s. Even small bucks stashed away now can snowball into big savings over time. Unlike simple interest, compound interest multiplies your earnings on your existing returns, helping your money grow faster the longer it stays invested in retirement accounts like a 401(k) or Roth IRA.

Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.', ""So, here's a smart question to wrap up your chat with a potential financial advisor. This question isn't just a final check-in – it's a chance for your advisor to showcase what they bring to the table, beyond what you might have asked about. Keep an ear out for responses that focus on how they can really make a difference in your life and match up with your unique needs. Watch out for advisors who dive into a big spiel about all their talents without linking it back to your personal goals. And be on the lookout for any shade thrown at your current advisor or other contenders – true pros don't need to dim someone else's shine to show off their own lig"", 'Next in line of key questions to ask your financial advisor is about the costs you would incur.', ""So, when you're talking money with your advisor, don't be shy to ask about any extra costs you might bump into. It's all about keeping things clear and avoiding any sneaky surprises down the road. Knowing upfront about potential charges like trading fees, account setup costs, or maintenance charges can help you plan your financial moves wisely. Transparency is key, so make sure you're fully clued in on the whole money picture!"", ""Life milestones are your cue to rethink your wealth management game plan. Whether it's a new heir joining the crew or hitting that golden age of 50, these events come bearing gifts of fresh investment opportunities. Got a fresh-faced addition to the family tree? Time to think about setting up an account for their bright future. Maybe you've hit the jackpot at 50 with the green light to pump up your retirement contributions. And hey, if the clock has ticked its way to 72, those mandatory withdrawals from your nest egg are knocking on your door."", 'Another key question to ask your financial advisor would be related to taxes.', ""Capital gains and losses can totally make or break that tax bill, so it's smart to get ahead of the game. It might even be the season to part ways with some securities at a loss to soften the tax blow. Your advisor can swoop in, assess your portfolio, and dish out the deets on whether that move is your best bet. Tax time is a money tango – so let your advisor lead and make sure you're both dancing to a tax-friendly beat."", ""Hey, so when you're talking to your advisor, don't be shy to ask them about the benchmarks they use for investments. It's important that the benchmarks actually line up with what they're investing in. Sometimes, advisors might talk about beating the S&P 500, but if they've got a whole mix of investments going on, that standard might not really fit the bill. The key is to make sure they're tracking progress in a way that makes sense for your specific investment goals and risk tolerance. It's all about keeping things aligned and making sure your money is working as hard as it can for you! The significance of investment benchmarks is what gets encapsulated in this 11th key question to ask your financial advisor."", ""When you're chatting with your advisor, it's super important to ask about the best options for both your liquid and illiquid funds. Liquid funds are like your go-to piggy bank for emergencies or fun splurges, while illiquid funds are the long-term savings stash you keep locked up for retirement. Understanding how your advisor handles these two types of funds is key. The strategies for short-term and long-term investments are totally different, so your advisor needs to tailor their approach accordingly. They should also know all about your goals and whether you need access to cash pronto or prefer a steadier ride with less ups and downs. It's all about finding the perfect balance for your financial journey!"", ""Is your investment portfolio all dressed up and ready to party in the right places? This question is another key question to ask your financial advisor, especially if you've got assets scattered across different financial hotspots. Rebalancing can get a bit hairy when your investments are all over the map – you don't want to end up with all your eggs in one risky basket. Got a hefty chunk of your net worth sitting in a single stock or drowning in a sea of cash? Time to shuffle the deck and figure out where your money should really be strutting its stuff."", 'Making sure your investment portfolio is firing on all cylinders means paying attention to asset allocation and security selection. Asset allocation is like mixing the perfect cocktail of different assets to balance risk and rewards. Security selection is picking out the star players within that mix. Chatting with your financial advisor about these aspects helps keep your portfolio diverse and in line with your risk tolerance and money goals.', ""Hey, just a heads-up – financial talk can get pretty jargony sometimes. But that doesn't mean your advisor should leave you feeling lost or make you hesitant to ask questions. If you're feeling like the jargon is flying over your head or the vibe is a bit condescending, it's totally okay to ask for a repeat in simpler terms. Your financial journey is about clarity and understanding, so don't settle for anything less!"", ""Want to find the perfect financial advisor match? Start by asking about their investment philosophy which gets answered through this 7th key question to ask your financial advisor. It's like swiping left or right on Tinder, but for your money goals! Make sure their approach lines up with yours – you don't want a financial advisor who's always pushing for a wild ride if you're more into steady growth. By diving into their investment philosophy, you're basically checking if you're vibing on the same money wavelength. You want someone who gets your money style and can tailor their strategies to fit your groove. Matching your investment philosophies is the ticket to a financial partnership that's as smooth as jazz. So, pop the question and watch as you're led to an advisor who speaks your financial language. It's like finding a money soulmate – now that's what I call a financial match made in heaven!"", 'So, don\'t be afraid to ask your advisor if they have any limitations. It\'s not about catching them out – it\'s more about making sure they\'re upfront about what they can handle. You want an advisor who\'s honest about their strengths and willing to point you in the right direction if something\'s outside their wheelhouse. If they claim they can do it all or give you a wishy-washy response, like ""We\'ll figure it out,"" that might be a sign they\'re not being straight with you.

Salesforce controls more than a fifth of the global CRM market, according to Gartner, while its closest competitors only hold mid-to-low-single-digit shares. Veeva is a much smaller company that mainly provides its CRM services to life science companies.', ""Yet Veeva probably wouldn't exist without Salesforce. Veeva was founded by Salesforce's former senior VP of Technology Peter Gassner, who still serves as its CEO, and the company still runs some of its services on Salesforce's platform. But over the past 12 months, Salesforce's stock has soared 74% as Veeva's stock has only rallied 39%. Let's see why the market leader outperformed its niche peer by such a wide margin, and if it's still the better buy."", 'Salesforce is most commonly associated with its CRM platform, but it also provides additional cloud-based sales, marketing, e-commerce, analytics, collaboration, and data visualization services. Most of those businesses struggled over the past two years as the macro headwinds forced companies to rein in their software spending.', ""In fiscal 2022 (which ended in Jan. 2022), Salesforce's revenue rose 25%. But its revenue only grew 18% in fiscal 2023 and increased 11% in fiscal 2024. It expects just 8%-9% growth in fiscal 2025. That slowdown spooked its growth-oriented investors, but the company laid off thousands of employees, cut costs, and paused its big acquisitions to boost its margins. It also launched its first buyback plan to boost its EPS and initiated its first dividend."", ""As a result, Salesforce's adjusted operating margin expanded from 18.7% in fiscal 2022 to 30.5% in fiscal 2024. Its adjusted EPS -- which dipped 3% in fiscal 2022 -- rose 10% in fiscal 2023 and surged 57% in fiscal 2024. Those bottom-line improvements allayed the activist investors who had besieged the company throughout the first half of calendar 2023. Analysts expect its adjusted EPS to grow 19% in fiscal 2025."", ""Salesforce is becoming more of an earnings growth story than a revenue growth one, but it expects the expansion of its Einstein AI services to lock in more customers and widen its moat. That outlook is encouraging, but its stock isn't cheap at 31 times forward earnings, and its forward dividend yield of 0.5% won't attract any serious income investors."", ""Veeva established a first-mover's advantage in the life sciences CRM market, and it also provides additional cloud-based storage and analytics services. But over the past year, it struggled as the macro headwinds drove many of its clients to downsize their sales teams, rein in their spending on new projects, and focus on larger R&D deals that took a longer time to recognize as revenue.

Unlike Salesforce, Veeva didn't aggressively cut costs, initiate big buybacks, or launch a dividend as its growth cooled off -- and its adjusted operating margin actually dipped from 41% in fiscal 2022 to 35.6% in fiscal 2024.

So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. As with many other companies Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) makes use of debt. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?"", ""Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Salesforce ', 'You can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Salesforce had US$9.43b of debt in January 2024, down from US$10.6b, one year before. But it also has US$14.2b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$4.77b net cash.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Salesforce had liabilities of US$26.6b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$13.5b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$14.2b in cash and US$11.4b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$14.6b.', ""Of course, Salesforce has a titanic market capitalization of US$285.5b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time. Despite its noteworthy liabilities, Salesforce boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!"", ""Even more impressive was the fact that Salesforce grew its EBIT by 223% over twelve months. If maintained that growth will make the debt even more manageable in the years ahead. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Salesforce's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", ""Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. While Salesforce has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, Salesforce actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit."", ""We could understand if investors are concerned about Salesforce's liabilities, but we can be reassured by the fact it has has net cash of US$4.77b. The cherry on top was that in converted 251% of that EBIT to free cash flow, bringing in US$9.5b. So we don't think Salesforce's use of debt is risky. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. To that end, you should be aware of the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Salesforce ."", ""When all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

The index is not governed by strict rules, but the selection committee prioritizes well-known companies with sterling reputations and histories of sustained growth.', 'Generally speaking, blue-chip companies produce consistent cash flows, and many divvy up a portion of their profits among shareholders. Indeed, 29 of the 30 companies in the Dow Jones currently pay dividends, and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) is the newest member of that group. The software giant declared its first-ever quarterly dividend in February; shareholders of record as of March 14 will receive $0.40 per share on April 11.', 'However, Salesforce may have another exciting announcement in the near future. This is pure speculation, but with its share price around $300, the company may decide to split its stock this year. Of course, whether that happens or not matters very little. Salesforce would be the same business in either scenario. But what does matter are the circumstances that made the stock split plausible.', 'Specifically, Salesforce last split its stock on April 18, 2013, and its share price has soared 625% since then, compounding at an annual rate of 19.8%. For context, Salesforce more than tripled the return of the Dow Jones during that period. That outperformance hints at a competitive advantage, and investors should strive to own such stocks.', 'Is Salesforce a buy right now?', 'Salesforce provides customer relationship management (CRM) software. Its platform includes productivity applications for sales, marketing, service, and commerce teams, as well as tools for application development, workflow automation, and data analytics. Collectively, those CRM products help businesses build and expand customer relationships over time.', 'Salesforce has dominated the CRM software market for the last 10 years. It accounted for 22.1% of CRM spending through the first half of 2023, more than the next four companies combined, and that dominance was broad based. To elaborate, Salesforce has a strong presence in several subcategories of CRM software, including multichannel marketing, digital commerce, customer service, and sales force automation. Additionally, peer-review-based research firm G2 ranked Salesforce as the best software seller in any product category in 2024, citing its strong foothold in multiple markets and its high customer satisfaction scores.', 'Salesforce reported solid fourth-quarter financial results, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 11% to $9.2 billion and non-GAAP net income increased 36% to $2.29 per diluted share. In the coming quarters, investors can expect similar momentum at a minimum, but growth could accelerate as Salesforce leans into artificial intelligence (AI) with two new products.', 'Data Cloud unifies information from Salesforce applications and third-party platforms like Amazon Web Services and Snowflake. In doing so, it helps businesses build customer profiles that support personalized experiences in every interaction. Data Cloud revenue is not readily apparent in financial filings because it flows through other segments, but CEO Marc Benioff said it has become the fastest-growing product in Salesforce history.', 'Data Cloud revenue increased nearly 90% in the fourth quarter, approaching an annual run rate of $400 million. Investors can expect similar momentum in the coming quarters. Salesforce was recently recognized as the market leader in customer data platforms (CDP), and Benioff believes Data Cloud will ""become the heart and soul"" of its CRM suite because it adds value to every application.', 'Data Cloud also has another key selling point: It provides a foundation for generative AI. Specifically, it not only helps businesses fine-tune large language models from third parties like OpenAI, but also powers Einstein Copilot, the conversational AI assistant Salesforce launched in February. Einstein Copilot can answer questions, summarize information, surface predictive insights, and automate tasks across the CRM platform.', 'Data Cloud and Einstein Copilot represent significant monetization opportunities. Straits Research believes the CDP market will expand at 26% annually through 2032, and Bloomberg Intelligence expects the generative AI software market to grow at 58% annually during the same period.', 'Looking ahead, Grand View Research expects CRM spending to climb at 14% annually through 2030. Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Salesforce to grow sales at 10% annually over the next five years, indicating that analysts anticipate market share losses. But that estimate leaves room for upside. Not only because Salesforce dominates the CRM software market, but also because the company has big opportunities with Data Cloud and Einstein Copilot.', 'That said, the current valuation of 8.6 times sales is tolerable even if the Wall Street consensus is correct. But that multiple could look cheap in hindsight if revenue grows more quickly. Investors that like those odds should consider buying a small position in this newly minted Dow Jones dividend stock today.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Salesforce right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Salesforce, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Salesforce wasn’t one of them.

The company is worth a whopping $2.2 trillion as of this writing, with $1.5 trillion of that value added within the last 12 months alone. Nvidia's recent success boils down to its data center chips designed for processing AI workloads, which continue to attract incredible demand."", ""But despite capturing the lion's share of investors' attention, Nvidia isn't the only opportunity in the semiconductor space. According to The Wall Street Journal, analysts have a consensus overweight (bullish) rating on two other names: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ: ACLS)."", ""Here's why owning shares of AMD and Axcelis might be a fantastic idea, too."", ""AMD's chips power some of the world's most popular consumer electronics, including Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox Series X, and even the infotainment systems in Tesla's electric vehicles. However, investors' attention is now on the data center."", ""The company has begun shipping its latest MI300 lineup of data center chips designed for AI workloads -- hardware that competes with Nvidia's industry-leading H100 graphics processing unit (GPU). The MI300 comes in two configurations: The MI300A combines GPU and CPU hardware to create an accelerated processing unit (APU), whereas the MI300X is a pure GPU."", 'The MI300A was selected by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to power its new El Capitan supercomputer, which is expected to be the fastest in the world when it comes online this year. However, AMD is also experiencing strong commercial demand for the MI300 range from leading data center operators like Oracle, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms.', ""The MI300 will likely send AMD's data center revenue soaring in the next few years. It won't be easy to catch Nvidia in that segment. However, AMD does have a 90% market share in AI-enabled personal computers. Its Ryzen 700 series (Ryzen AI) chips are designed to handle powerful AI workloads on-device, leading to faster response times for the end user because requests aren't traveling back and forth to the data center."", ""Millions of computers from leading manufacturers like Dell, HP, and Asus (among others) have already shipped with Ryzen AI chips. In the recent fourth quarter of 2023, Ryzen AI chips sent AMD's Client segment revenue soaring 62% year over year. The company plans to launch a new processor, which is up to three times faster than previous iterations, so this business is just getting warmed up."", ""Combined with a forecast $3.5 billion revenue contribution from the MI300 series in their first full year of sales, 2024 is set to be AMD's biggest year yet. It's no surprise that the majority of the 50 analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal have given AMD stock the highest possible buy rating."", ""Axcelis Technologies isn't a glamorous producer of GPUs like Nvidia or AMD. In fact, it's relatively overlooked, with The Wall Street Journal tracking just eight analysts who cover its stock. Nevertheless, the majority of them have given it the highest possible buy rating, and it trades at a very attractive valuation right now, which might entice investors to follow the Street's lead."", 'Axcelis manufactures ion implantation equipment, which is critical to the chip fabrication process. Producers of silicon carbide power devices -- which regulate electric power in workloads with high currents -- are a significant source of demand for Axcelis at the moment, thanks especially to the electric vehicle industry. Silicon carbide chemistry is more efficient than traditional silicon chemistry, which leads to more mileage per battery charge and faster charging times.', 'The company is also preparing for growing demand from producers of AI-related semiconductors. Last year, the company noted that AI requires significantly more memory and storage capacity, which could make DRAM and NAND chips more complex to manufacture, and more expensive.', ""Axcelis generated a record $1.13 billion in revenue during 2023, representing a 22.9% year-over-year increase. But here's the kicker: The company ended 2023 with an order backlog worth $1.2 billion, so 2024 is shaping up to be another record year."", ""The stock is up over 400% in the last five years, but it has taken a breather over the last few months, suffering a 44% decline from its all-time high. That might spell opportunity, because based on the company's $7.43 in earnings per share in 2023, the stock now trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.6. That's a 59% discount to the 35.6 P/E ratio of the iShares Semiconductor ETF, so Axcelis' stock is substantially cheaper than the rest of the chip industry, on average."", ""Moreover, when you also consider Wall Street's bullish stance on Axcelis stock, there is a very clear case for buying it right now."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Leading the way were tech titans Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) at $20.7 billion and $14.9 billion, respectively. ', 'Dividend payments are likely to set a new record this year. One catalyst is that fellow tech titan Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) initiated a dividend, which should total more than $5 billion this year. It\'s now the fourth member, along with Nvidia, of the vaunted ""Magnificent Seven"" to join the bandwagon of dividend-paying stocks. ', ""Among the holdouts is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). It's high time for the search giant to start paying dividends. Here's why."", 'Microsoft, Apple, and Meta Platforms can afford to pay massive dividends because they generate huge cash flows. Over the past six months, Microsoft has produced $49.4 billion in operating cash flow. It returned $19.5 billion to shareholders through dividend payments ($10.6 billion) and share repurchases ($8.8 billion). Apple is also a cash flow machine. It generated $39.9 billion in cash from operating activities in its fiscal first quarter. It paid $3.8 billion in dividends and repurchased $20.1 billion in stock. Meanwhile, Meta Platforms produced $40.8 billion in net cash from operating activities last year and used $20 billion to repurchase shares. ', ""Alphabet is just as good at generating cash as its dividend-paying Magnificent Seven peers. Last year, the search giant produced a prodigious $101.7 billion in net cash from operating activities. While the company didn't use any of that money to pay dividends, it did return $61.5 billion to shareholders through repurchases. "", ""However, the company could easily follow Meta's approach when it initiated its dividend earlier this year. CFO Susan Li commented on Meta's new dividend policy on the fourth-quarter earnings conference call:"", ""Aside from organic investments, returning capital to shareholders remains important to us. We believe our strong financial position and performance will enable us to invest in the business while also continuing to return capital to investors over time. We've historically done so through share repurchases, and while we expect to maintain an active share repurchase program, we are modestly evolving our approach going forward by returning a portion of capital through a regular dividend. "", 'Another reason tech titans Microsoft, Apple, and now Meta Platforms are paying dividends is that they have a lot of cash on their balance sheets.', 'Magnificent Seven Dividend Stock', 'Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Short-Term Investments', 'Total Debt Outstanding', 'Net Cash Position', 'Apple', '$172.6 billion', '$108 billion', '$64.6 billion', 'Microsoft', '$81 billion', '$74.2 billion', '$7 billion', 'Meta Platforms', '$65.4 billion', '$18.4 billion', '$47 billion', 'Data sources: Company websites. Data as of the end of 2023. ', ""Apple's net cash position alone could fund its current dividend outlay for more than four years, while Meta's would last nearly a decade."", 'Alphabet has an equally enormous cash position. It ended last year with $110.9 billion of cash, equivalents, and marketable securities against only $13.3 billion in debt. ', ""Like its peers, Alphabet produces more cash than it needs to grow its business. The money it doesn't return to shareholders through buybacks is piling up on its balance sheet. While the company might be strategically holding cash to make a sizable acquisition, that seems unlikely, since mergers and acquisitions aren't a big part of its growth strategy. The company's biggest deal was its $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola Mobility in 2012. Other notable deals were relatively smaller including Nest at $3.2 billion in 2014, Fitbit at $2.1 billion in 2021, and YouTube at $1.7 billion in 2005. Between that and the increased regulatory scrutiny of acquisitions in the tech sector, Alphabet probably won't use its cash position to make a big deal. "", ""That leaves returning it to shareholders as the most likely outcome. On one hand, it's hard to argue with its share repurchase program. Alphabet has reduced its outstanding shares by 10% over the past five years, second only to Apple in this group. Alphabet could buy back even more shares, which wouldn't be a bad idea, since it has the lowest forward P/E ratio in this group at 21. However, a dividend could broaden its appeal to more investors, which could boost its valuation. Meanwhile, paying a dividend would put cash in the pockets of long-term holders, not those selling shares to Alphabet as part of the repurchases. "", ""Microsoft and Apple pay their investors billions of dollars in dividends each year. Meta is joining them this year. It's time for Alphabet to get on board, too. Like its peers, it produces massive cash flows, which are piling up on its balance sheet. It really doesn't have much use for that money, other than returning it to investors. While its buyback is doing a good job, the company can easily squeeze in a dividend to provide its investors with a little income."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

But we are getting ahead of ourselves."", 'The first thing Nvidia has to do is split its stock. Amazon could be added only because it split its stock in June 2022. With a price of nearly $900 a share and the median price of a Dow component around $175 a share, Nvidia would have to issue at least a 5-for-1 stock split to avoid tilting the balance of the index.', ""Another issue is timing. There's no schedule for Dow shakeups. But they don't happen too often. Given Amazon just got added, it's unlikely we'll get another swap for at least a couple of years. Alphabet may be first in line for a swap considering its history, market position, and the fact it already split its stock in July 2022."", 'Deciding which component to replace, the stock split ratio, and the timing of the next index restructuring are all relatively minor challenges in the grand scheme of things. The bigger question is whether Nvidia deserves to be a blue-chip Dow stock or if its growth is fleeting.', ""Nvidia is an unrecognizable business from just a few years ago. And it's all because of data centers."", 'Go back to fiscal 2022, and the Graphics segment a far larger segment than Compute and Networking (led by data centers) for Nvidia, generating nearly double the operating income. But in just two years, Compute and Networking performance exploded. In fiscal 2024, Compute and Networking made up 77.8% of total revenue and 84.5% of segment-operating income, with operating income up nearly seven times in that period.', ""Customers are rapidly building AI models and demanding more and more output from Nvidia's chips. However, the semiconductor industry is cyclical. Right now, demand is outpacing supply, driving prices and margin expansion for Nvidia."", ""For Nvidia to sustain its torrid growth rate, AI has to be worth the expense for businesses. In other words, they have to make money on the solutions. For example, if Apple spends a fortune developing an AI assistant for every iPhone and tries to charge a monthly fee that many customers are unwilling to pay, then it's probably not going to accelerate its spending."", ""Microsoft is having breakout success with its AI solutions, like Copilots for Microsoft 365, GitHub AI, Azure AI for cloud infrastructure, and more. It's working now, but the pace of growth could change based on the market, the economy, and customer reception of these solutions."", 'No one knows when it will happen, but Nvidia will eventually enter a downturn, and its growth will slow. At that point, earnings will fall, and the stock will look more expensive -- as is the nature of cyclical industries. The market may be less willing to pay up for Nvidia during that period.', 'Nvidia has the makings of a Dow stock. But the growth of its data center business has happened in a flash.', 'Before Nvidia gets added to the Dow, the market will need to see how this business does during a downturn and mid-cycle conditions. No company is going to get added to the Dow just because its business is hot right now. If that were the case, PayPal could have been added in early 2021 to replace or pair with Visa. Three years ago, PayPal briefly overtook Mastercard in market cap but is worth around seven times less than Mastercard today. Or Zoom Video Communications could have been added in 2020.', ""There are plenty of periods in the stock market where investors get super excited about a theme and drive valuations higher. I don't think AI is a bubble, and I think much of Nvidia's growth is here to stay. But I do expect the pace of growth to slow and want to get a better look at how Nvidia's data center business performs during that slowdown.

Its social media apps, anchored by Instagram and Facebook, are seeing solid engagement, with over 3 billion users checking in with the apps daily."", ""Investors were more thrilled to see advertising revenue jump to $132 billion in 2023 from $114 billion a year earlier.

Most Wall Street pros are looking for earnings per share to rise about 33% this year, to $20.', ""There's a clear risk of buying this stock during a time of elevated optimism that will necessarily limit your returns. Meta Platforms' shares are priced at 10 times annual sales, or about the highest valuation seen to date. You could have snapped up this business for around 3 times revenue back in early 2023, after all."", ""Yet Meta's stock spike hasn't been powered simply by high expectations around the potential impact from artificial intelligence (AI). There's more substance to this rally. The business is accelerating growth in its user base and in its core advertising business. While it can't keep showing more and more ads to users, Meta has room to continue improving on sales as pricing trends for digital ads strengthen in 2024."", ""There's a good chance that margins will move closer to 50% of sales in the next few years, meanwhile, as its research and development investments start paying bigger dividends. In that scenario, Meta Platforms could easily earn its premium of 33 times earnings and 10 times sales over the coming years.

And new and intriguing use cases continue to join the fold.', 'Microsoft jump-started its creation of generative AI tools with a strategic partnership and stake in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, a move that now seems prescient. Microsoft quickly found ways to integrate AI across a broad cross-section of its most widely used products, making them even more useful.', ""The crown jewel of these efforts is Copilot, Microsoft's AI-powered helper.

Just last week, Evercore ISI analyst Kirk Materne updated his estimates, suggesting Microsoft's generative AI efforts could produce incremental revenue of $143 billion by 2027. For context, Microsoft had total revenue of $212 billion in fiscal 2023 (ended Jun. 30, 2023), suggesting a potential revenue boost of as much as 67% over four years."", 'To be clear, plenty would have to go right for Microsoft to achieve this lofty benchmark, but it helps illustrate the magnitude of the opportunity.', ""Recent results suggest that AI is also having a halo effect on Microsoft Azure, the company's cloud infrastructure business."", ""In its fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023), Microsoft revealed that cloud services revenue climbed 30% year over year -- faster than both Alphabet's Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services (AWS), which grew 26% and 13%, respectively.

Many companies pay and increase their dividends for 10 years, 25 years, and (in the case of Dividend Kings) even 50 years or more."", ""Predicting which companies will increase their dividends is easier than you might think. But sometimes, the timing can be less predictable. Indeed, stocks that I would have featured for this article -- including Domino's Pizza, Waste Management, and Universal Display -- already announced a dividend hike in recent weeks, just before I could highlight them."", ""Here's why it's relatively easy to find dividend-growth companies: Management teams generally like to continue dividend streaks once they get going. And dividends are paid from a company's earnings. Therefore, when companies already pay a dividend and have consistent earnings far above what's needed to cover the dividend, these are good candidates for dividend increases."", 'Coffee giant Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), discount-retail chain Dollar General (NYSE: DG), and swimming pool supply company Pool Corp. (NASDAQ: POOL) are three companies that fit this description right now and could consequently hike their dividends in 2024.', 'With over 38,000 locations around the world and bagged coffee available in grocery stores nationwide, Starbucks is a global brand that needs no introduction.', ""However, many might be surprised to learn how quickly this company is still growing. It opened more than 500 new locations in its fiscal first quarter of 2024 alone -- that's a new Starbucks location every four hours on average."", ""Starbucks doesn't intend to slow down at all. It hopes to have 45,000 locations by the end of fiscal 2025, which means that the pace of new store openings could actually increase from Q1."", 'These new Starbucks locations are a growing source of profits. And this is why I believe the company will have plenty of room to hike its dividend in 2024 and in subsequent years as well.', ""Starbucks has paid and increased its dividend for 13 straight years now -- a streak management is eager to keep going. It last raised its dividend by 7% in September. And it's grown like clockwork over the past decade, as the chart below shows."", 'As recently as October, Dollar General shareholders were experiencing the worst pullback since it went public, down more than 60% from its all-time high. Back then, the market was concerned about slowing store traffic and slumping profits. But the stock is coming back as the company charts a course to overcome its challenges.', 'In its fiscal 2023 (which ended Feb. 2), Dollar General had net sales of nearly $39 billion, which was a slight increase from its fiscal 2022. However, all of its profit metrics took a step back because its had too much inventory, leading to theft and other issues.', ""Dollar General doesn't necessarily expect marked improvement in fiscal 2024. Management is only guiding for 6% net sales growth, most of which will come from opening 800 new stores. And it expects full-year earnings per share (EPS) of $6.80 to $7.55 -- a far cry from its EPS of $10.68 in its fiscal 2022."", 'But Dollar General management is making progress to fix its struggles -- inventory per store was down 1% at the end of fiscal 2023. In the meantime, the company is profitable enough to support the dividend even at these suppressed levels. Its annual dividend is only $2.36 per share as of this writing.', ""Even if Dollar General hits the low end of its EPS guidance in fiscal 2024, it will still have room to hike its dividend. It's raised its dividend for eight straight years now. And with plenty of breathing room, I doubt the company will miss the chance to extend the streak to nine years in the near future."", ""Of these three companies, Pool Corp. is likely the most obscure and that's a shame. Over the last 10 years, shares of Pool are up nearly 600%, trouncing the returns for Starbucks, Dollar General, and the S&P 500."", 'Pool is in an interesting situation right now. It experienced unusually high growth during the pandemic as people upgraded their living spaces with swimming pools. Net sales of nearly $6.2 billion in 2022 were its highest ever. But in 2023, net sales dropped by 10%.', ""It's unusual for Pool's sales to drop. But for perspective, net sales of $5.5 billion in 2023 were still its second highest ever. And for 2024, Pool expects its profits to be stable."", ""That's all Pool needs to hike its dividend for an 11th consecutive year in 2024. In the past year, it's only paid out roughly one-third of its profits as dividends, so it has plenty of breathing room for an increase. And long-term, investors don't need to fret either. The company benefits when pools are installed but continues to profit for years to come with ongoing sales of supplies."", 'I believe Starbucks, Dollar General, and Pool could all be great dividend growth stocks for long-term investors.

This should concern investors, who have more reasons to question whether the coffee stock can beat the market over time.', ""Despite Starbucks' longtime presence, its industry has tremendous room for growth. According to Grand View Research, the specialty coffee market is expected to grow at a compound annual rate of 11% through 2030."", 'Since Starbucks operates in numerous countries, it could be better positioned than any other company to capitalize on this trend. With that, CEO Laxman Narasimhan recently announced at a conference that Starbucks can grow to 55,000 locations by 2030.', ""However, one might also question the company's ability to capitalize on that increased interest, particularly in the U.S. In its home country, Starbucks must compete with numerous independents, chains such as Dunkin' and Dutch Bros, and likely from McDonald's beverage chain CosMc's, which has shown early signs of success."", 'Also, in its second-largest market, China, Starbucks faces off against Luckin Coffee and others. This places more pressure on Starbucks to keep its iconic brand vital and win the never-ending battle to buy from Starbucks rather than peers.', ""With the continued expansion, Starbucks' revenue for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 31) rose 8% yearly to $9.4 billion. That was less than the 12% rise in fiscal 2023, though it included a 5% increase in comparable store sales in fiscal Q1."", 'Moreover, net earnings for fiscal Q1 rose 20% to just over $1 billion as the rise in operating expenses lagged revenue growth. Still, profits rose 26% in fiscal 2023, so profit growth rates may have trended downward.', 'Additionally, its peer, Dutch Bros, grew revenue by 31% in 2023 simply by following its regional-to-national expansion plan. Now that Dutch Bros earns an annual profit, that stock may appear more attractive to investors.', ""That's not to say that Starbucks doesn't shine in some areas. Dutch Bros grew its same-shop sales by only 3%, a lower rate than Starbucks. Additionally, Dutch Bros doesn't pay a dividend, while Starbucks shareholders earn $2.28 per share annually in payouts, a dividend yield of 2.5%. Since this payout has risen yearly since its introduction in 2010, current investors have good reason to stay with the stock."", ""Dutch Bros stock has outperformed Starbucks by a tiny margin, even when including dividends. However, Starbucks' more significant concern is competition against the S&P 500. Unfortunately, investors have to go back more than 10 years to find a period where its total returns outperformed the index. Even though the P/E ratio of 25 is near multi-year lows, that may not be enough to draw investors into Starbucks stock."", 'Under current conditions, investors should probably treat Starbucks stock as a hold. Its massive footprint and powerful global brand bring it stability, and the continued revenue and comparable-store sales growth show that it holds up well against intense competition.', ""Unfortunately, its stability may not address the rising competitive threat from peers like Dutch Bros and a new McDonald's beverage franchise. Nor does it compensate for its underperformance compared to the S&P 500."", ""Additionally, Dutch Bros' regional-to-national expansion likely makes it a more attractive stock to growth investors. While continued expansion and rising dividends should keep current investors in Starbucks stock, new investors are likely better off putting money to work in the S&P 500 or possibly Starbucks' rising competitor."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Starbucks right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Starbucks, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Starbucks wasn’t one of them.

Better yet, you'd like to see the share price move up more than the market average. But Roper Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ROP) has fallen short of that second goal, with a share price rise of 66% over five years, which is below the market return. However, more recent buyers should be happy with the increase of 29% over the last year."", ""So let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Roper Technologies ', ""To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time."", ""Over half a decade, Roper Technologies managed to grow its earnings per share at 6.9% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 11% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth."", 'The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).', ""We know that Roper Technologies has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? If you're interested, you could check this free report showing consensus revenue forecasts."", ""It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Roper Technologies' TSR for the last 5 years was 71%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!"", ""Roper Technologies shareholders have received returns of 29% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the general market return. Most would be happy with a gain, and it helps that the year's return is actually better than the average return over five years, which was 11%.

If you wish to skip our in-depth analysis of the financial advisory services sector, you can go directly to 5 Key Questions To Ask Your Financial Advisor.', ""The Financial Advisory Services Market, valued at a whopping USD 94.8 Billion in 2022, is all set to hit USD 157.7 Billion by 2032 with a cool growth rate of 5.3%. This sector is soaring because small and medium-sized businesses are seeking more advice, there's a surge in high-net-worth individuals, and people are exploring alternative investments like never before. Over in North America, they're ruling the financial advisory services game. The folks there are really into investing and saving, they value financial literacy, and they're all about planning for medical emergencies and retirement."", 'And hey, some big hitters in this market include names like Deloitte, Bank of America, JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Blackrock, Vanguard, McKinsey, BCG, KPMG, EY, and a bunch more. These players are making some serious moves in the financial advisory services world!', 'Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), for instance, is making big moves to hit a whopping $10 trillion in total wealth management client assets. They set up a special division focused on workplaces back in 2019, right after snapping up Solium Capital Inc., a company that handled equity administration and financial services for employers. Since then, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) has been ramping up their offerings in workplace services – think equity deals, financial wellness programs, and retirement services.', ""Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) have even got Graystone Consulting in their corner, a team that helps both workplaces and retirement plans with their investments. Recently, Morgan Stanley's profit took a little dip, dropping by 32% to $1.5 billion in the last quarter of 2023, ending 31 December. But hey, their revenue actually went up by 1% to $12.9 billion compared to the same time last year. And get this – their wealth management sector brought in a cool $6.6 billion, holding steady from the previous year."", ""BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK), on the other hand, is a major player in the financial world, rocking the title of the world's largest asset manager with a jaw-dropping $10 trillion in assets under their management by the end of 2023. BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) recently made a big move by swooping in and snapping up Global Infrastructure Partners for a cool $12.5 billion in January 2024. This ain't just any deal – it's a bold step into alternative assets, with BlackRock diving into investments in ports, power, and digital infrastructure projects all over the globe. Once this deal is done, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) are going to be sitting on around $150 billion in infrastructure assets, from US liquefied natural gas to wastewater services in France to airports in England and Australia."", ""Moreover, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is not messing around when it comes to financial services! They're a top-ranking global player in investment banking, securities, and investment management, serving a wide array of clients ranging from big corporations to regular folks like you and me."", 'Just recently, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) announced some seriously impressive numbers. They pulled in a whopping $46.25 billion in net revenues and raked in $8.52 billion in net earnings for the entire year of 2023. In the last quarter alone, their net revenues hit $11.32 billion and net earnings stood at $2.01 billion. And get this – The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) diluted earnings per common share for the whole of 2023 clocked in at $22.87, while for the fourth quarter of 2023, it was $5.48.', 'With this let’s now move forward to our list of 15 Key Questions To Ask Your Financial Advisor.', 'A successful financial advisor giving advice to a satisfied client in an office.', 'To curate our list of 15 Key Questions To Ask Your Financial Advisor, we researched across the internet to list down the most frequently mentioned questions to ask your financial advisory, from which we narrowed down the 15 Key Questions To Ask Your Financial Advisor. Let’s take a look at them.', 'By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.', ""So, here's a smart question to wrap up your chat with a potential financial advisor. This question isn't just a final check-in – it's a chance for your advisor to showcase what they bring to the table, beyond what you might have asked about. Keep an ear out for responses that focus on how they can really make a difference in your life and match up with your unique needs. Watch out for advisors who dive into a big spiel about all their talents without linking it back to your personal goals. And be on the lookout for any shade thrown at your current advisor or other contenders – true pros don't need to dim someone else's shine to show off their own lig"", 'Next in line of key questions to ask your financial advisor is about the costs you would incur.', ""So, when you're talking money with your advisor, don't be shy to ask about any extra costs you might bump into. It's all about keeping things clear and avoiding any sneaky surprises down the road. Knowing upfront about potential charges like trading fees, account setup costs, or maintenance charges can help you plan your financial moves wisely. Transparency is key, so make sure you're fully clued in on the whole money picture!"", ""Life milestones are your cue to rethink your wealth management game plan. Whether it's a new heir joining the crew or hitting that golden age of 50, these events come bearing gifts of fresh investment opportunities. Got a fresh-faced addition to the family tree? Time to think about setting up an account for their bright future. Maybe you've hit the jackpot at 50 with the green light to pump up your retirement contributions. And hey, if the clock has ticked its way to 72, those mandatory withdrawals from your nest egg are knocking on your door."", 'Another key question to ask your financial advisor would be related to taxes.', ""Capital gains and losses can totally make or break that tax bill, so it's smart to get ahead of the game. It might even be the season to part ways with some securities at a loss to soften the tax blow. Your advisor can swoop in, assess your portfolio, and dish out the deets on whether that move is your best bet. Tax time is a money tango – so let your advisor lead and make sure you're both dancing to a tax-friendly beat."", ""Hey, so when you're talking to your advisor, don't be shy to ask them about the benchmarks they use for investments. It's important that the benchmarks actually line up with what they're investing in. Sometimes, advisors might talk about beating the S&P 500, but if they've got a whole mix of investments going on, that standard might not really fit the bill. The key is to make sure they're tracking progress in a way that makes sense for your specific investment goals and risk tolerance. It's all about keeping things aligned and making sure your money is working as hard as it can for you! The significance of investment benchmarks is what gets encapsulated in this 11th key question to ask your financial advisor."", ""When you're chatting with your advisor, it's super important to ask about the best options for both your liquid and illiquid funds. Liquid funds are like your go-to piggy bank for emergencies or fun splurges, while illiquid funds are the long-term savings stash you keep locked up for retirement. Understanding how your advisor handles these two types of funds is key. The strategies for short-term and long-term investments are totally different, so your advisor needs to tailor their approach accordingly. They should also know all about your goals and whether you need access to cash pronto or prefer a steadier ride with less ups and downs. It's all about finding the perfect balance for your financial journey!"", ""Is your investment portfolio all dressed up and ready to party in the right places? This question is another key question to ask your financial advisor, especially if you've got assets scattered across different financial hotspots. Rebalancing can get a bit hairy when your investments are all over the map – you don't want to end up with all your eggs in one risky basket. Got a hefty chunk of your net worth sitting in a single stock or drowning in a sea of cash? Time to shuffle the deck and figure out where your money should really be strutting its stuff."", 'Making sure your investment portfolio is firing on all cylinders means paying attention to asset allocation and security selection. Asset allocation is like mixing the perfect cocktail of different assets to balance risk and rewards. Security selection is picking out the star players within that mix. Chatting with your financial advisor about these aspects helps keep your portfolio diverse and in line with your risk tolerance and money goals.', ""Hey, just a heads-up – financial talk can get pretty jargony sometimes. But that doesn't mean your advisor should leave you feeling lost or make you hesitant to ask questions. If you're feeling like the jargon is flying over your head or the vibe is a bit condescending, it's totally okay to ask for a repeat in simpler terms. Your financial journey is about clarity and understanding, so don't settle for anything less!"", ""Want to find the perfect financial advisor match? Start by asking about their investment philosophy which gets answered through this 7th key question to ask your financial advisor. It's like swiping left or right on Tinder, but for your money goals! Make sure their approach lines up with yours – you don't want a financial advisor who's always pushing for a wild ride if you're more into steady growth. By diving into their investment philosophy, you're basically checking if you're vibing on the same money wavelength. You want someone who gets your money style and can tailor their strategies to fit your groove. Matching your investment philosophies is the ticket to a financial partnership that's as smooth as jazz. So, pop the question and watch as you're led to an advisor who speaks your financial language. It's like finding a money soulmate – now that's what I call a financial match made in heaven!"", 'So, don\'t be afraid to ask your advisor if they have any limitations. It\'s not about catching them out – it\'s more about making sure they\'re upfront about what they can handle. You want an advisor who\'s honest about their strengths and willing to point you in the right direction if something\'s outside their wheelhouse. If they claim they can do it all or give you a wishy-washy response, like ""We\'ll figure it out,"" that might be a sign they\'re not being straight with you.

The recent news from the sector is almost laughably inconsistent. ', 'On March 6, 2024, this headline caught my eye: “Oil prices spike on crude inventory update and Powell’s rate-cut outlook.” But less than 24 hours later, this headline followed: “Oil prices slip on view US rate cuts could be delayed.', 'But like any commodity, oil prices come down to supply and demand. Or, as the headlines illustrate, it’s the perception of where supply and demand is headed. As traders and investors in the oil and gas sector know, if you’re not in when the sentiment shifts, you’ll miss the biggest gains. ', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'One of those shifts is likely to come when the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates. Since October 2023, crude oil prices have been heading on the perception that the Fed was done raising rates. That means the next move in interest rates would be lower. ', 'That same dynamic is in place today. If you’re a long-term investor, when the rate cut happens isn’t necessarily as important as the reality that, at some point, it will happen. ', 'That will be bullish for oil prices. And that’s why it’s important to take a position in oil and gas stocks now.', 'The good news is that to find the top oil and gas stocks to buy you don’t have to look very far. In fact, most of them are the names you would expect. That’s okay, you need conviction, not special knowledge to benefit from the rise in oil stocks as crude moves to new highs later this year. \xa0 ', 'Source: Golden Dayz / Shutterstock.com', 'The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEARCA:XLE) is an obvious choice as one of the top oil and gas stocks to buy. You’ll find many of the companies on this list among its holdings which is what you would expect from a sector ETF. And over 95% of the fund’s holdings are U.S. companies. ', 'The fund has returned about 37% in the last five years and pays a dividend with a 3.57% yield. As you’ll see, that compares favorably with many of the top big oil stocks, making it suitable for income-oriented investors.', 'And with an expense ratio of just 0.10% investors may wonder, what’s not to like? For that, I might point out the fund’s beta value of 1.36. That suggests that if the price of oil falls, the fund may fall more than several of the individual components. ', 'That’s not an issue if you believe oil prices are going up. But if you believe that macroeconomic factors, such as OPEC+ lifting their production cuts, would lower the price of oil, the XLE won’t be as strong of an investment. ', 'Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com', 'Oil stocks like Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) have been a better trade than investment for growth investors since 2019. However, long-term, income-oriented investors have done well. Despite fluctuations on the top and bottom lines, Exxon Mobil has delivered a share price return of 35.8% in the last five years. And investors also get a dividend with a yield of 3.54%. Put that together and you can see why XOM stock is one of the top oil and gas stocks to buy. ', 'One of the highlights of 2023 for Exxon Mobil was the 18% growth it recorded in its Guyana and Permian operation. This was a record in annual production. ', 'Last year was also a year that saw the beginning of consolidation in the sector. In October, Exxon announced it was acquiring Pioneer Natural Resources (NYSE:PXD) in an all-stock deal for $59.5 billion. The deal is expected to be finalized in the first half of 2024. ', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com', 'Warren Buffett surprised some investors with his significant investment in Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) in 2020. At that time, Buffett expressed his confidence in OXY’s CEO Vicki Hollub. He’s been backing up those words ever since and particularly so in 2023.', 'On three different occasions, Buffett’s hedge fund Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) made significant buys of OXY stock. In fact, the buys became so predictable that investors now see a Buffett buy zone in OXY stock. Berkshire now owns $14 billion of OXY stock which equates to a 27% interest in the company.', 'OXY has been a market laggard for over the last five years with a negative return of 2.65% in that time. However, OXY is well-positioned to spring higher as crude prices move higher. And the company took a signficant step to winning back investors by reinstating its dividend in 2023 and promptly increasing it by 20% in the first quarter of 2024. ', 'Source: JL IMAGES / Shutterstock.com', 'Chevron (NYSE:CVX) is another Buffett favorite and with good reason. The company continues to prioritize shareholder equity through a series of share buybacks and a dividend that yields an eye-popping 4.36% and one that the company has increased for 37 consecutive years.', 'Like Exxon, Chevron is in the middle of a potential acquisition. The company reached an agreement to buy Hess (NYSE:HES) in an all-stock deal worth $53 billion.', 'A dispute has arisen over what company has the rights to an oil block in Guyana that is a centerpiece of the deal. But even before that, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) regulators have expressed skepticism about allowing the deal to go through.', 'Obviously it wouldn’t be optimal for the deal to fall through, but both companies are in solid financial positions that it doesn’t change the long-term reason to own either stock. With crude prices rising, analysts have assigned a consensus price target of $180 which suggests they believe that\xa0CVS stock is undervalued at around 11.4x forward earnings. ', 'Source: Valentin Martynov / Shutterstock.com', 'Schlumberger (NYSE:SLB) is an oilfield services company. It’s also the world’s largest offshore oil driling company. Both of those business units put Schlumberger in a position to capitalize on what is likely to be a super cycle in oil in 2025 and beyond. ', 'One reason behind falling oil prices was an expectation that electric vehicle (EV) ownership would take off. In March 2024, however, the EV revolution is clearly on hold. The reasons for that are for another article, and probably another website. But what investors need to know is that regardless of who occupies the White House in 2025, oil drilling is going to increase.', 'In the fourth quarter of 2023, Schlumberger reported significant growth for its digital offerings as customers are migrating to SLB’s cloud, edge, and AI products.', 'And as oil drilling resumes, offshore drilling will increase because it is less carbon intensive than traditional onshore drilling. That plays into another strength of the company. ', 'Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com', 'You can’t say that Diamondback Energy (NYSE:FANG) is undervalued. Nevertheless, despite being up 28% in the last 12 months and trading near the top of its 52-week range, Diamondback Energy remains one of the top oil and gas stocks to buy for the coming oil bull market. ', 'It’s not completely clear sailing for FANG stock. Like Chevron, Diamondback is facing regulatory scrutiny over its proposed acquisition of Endeavour Energy Resources. The concern is Endeavour’s status as the Permian Basin’s largest privately held oil and gas producer.', 'Despite the noise, analysts continue to bid FANG stock higher. The consensus price target of $194.15 is only about 6.2% higher than its closing price on March 7, 2024. However, since March 1, at least two analysts have increased their price targets at levels above consensus. The largest of these came from Piper Sandler which reiterated its Overweight rating and assigned FANG stock a $227 price target, up from $222. ', 'Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.com', 'On the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call, Devon Energy’s (NYSE:DVN) CEO Rick Muncrief commented on why energy stocks make up just 4% of the S&P 500 weighting despite being responsible for approximately 10% of the index’s earnings.', 'Muncrief cited diplomatically “extreme valuation in tech,” but he also said that analysts are not appreciating how much demand will still exist for hydrocarbons over time.', 'For shareholders of DVN stock, that reevaluation can’t come soon enough. Shares of DVN stock are down over 15% in the last 12 months, making it a huge laggard to the sector. The sell-off hasn’t been completely undeserved. Devon has delivered lower revenue and earnings on a year-over-year basis for the last four quarters. ', 'Nevertheless, at a forward P/E of 8.9x, the stock looks undervalued. Analysts agree. They have a $53.20 price target on DVN stock which would push the stock 15% higher than its closing price on March 6, 2024. Additionally, 22 out of 33 analysts give the stock a Strong Buy or Buy rating. ', 'On the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in CVX.

In the past 52 weeks, NVO has popped up over 92%.', 'These metrics might stop prospective investors in their tracks. Not helping matters is that while analysts do rate NVO stock as a moderate buy, the average price target is $118.86. That implies downside risk of almost 13%. Nevertheless, it’s also important to realize that NVO gained nearly 11% in the pats five sessions.', 'Translation? This idea seems to have legs. Fundamentally, investors have responded vigorously to Novo Nordisk’s phase 1 trial data for Amycretin, the company’s latest weight-loss product. The new drug shows over 13% weight loss in users after 12 weeks of use, a far superior result to Novo’s other drug Wegovy.', 'With 2024 and 2025 revenue projected to hit $41.57 billion and $49.33 billion, respectively, it may be time to readjust expectations northward. Novo is delivering, making NVO one of the top weight-loss stocks.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'If you want a sector-related idea that’s away from the glaring spotlight, Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) could be intriguing. A multinational biopharmaceutical company, is conducting early stage human trials for an experimental obesity drug. In a medical journal, Amgen stated that the therapeutic promoted significant weight loss with an acceptable safety profile.', 'However, the market hasn’t exactly been impressed. Since the beginning of the year, AMGN stock lost more than 8% of equity value. Over the past 52 weeks, it gained over 19% – a solid return but nothing like Novo Nordisk. Still, that’s what makes AMGN intriguing for speculators.', 'Right now, analysts anticipate that 2024 sales will land at $33.02 billion. If so, that would translate to a 17.1% gain from last year’s sales of $28.19 billion. And in 2025, they believe the company can post revenue of $34.16 billion. That would translate to 3.4% growth over projected 2024 sales.', 'To entice prospective investors, the market prices AMGN at 15.19X trailing-year earnings without non-recurring items (NRI).

After combing through publicly available information on the privately traded company, the space market researcher calculated that SpaceX probably nearly doubled its revenue to $8.7 billion in 2023, and generated ""significant"" profits. (Payload didn\'t hazard a guess at a precise profits figure, but Bloomberg reported late last year that profits were on track to reach $3 billion, ""adjusted"" to exclude one-time items.)', 'Not long after publishing its report, Payload pulled its crystal ball out of the closet, dusted it off, and attempted an even more difficult feat: Calculating how much money SpaceX will make in 2024.', 'Payload\'s latest report, titled simply ""Predicting SpaceX\'s 2024 Revenue,"" takes as its starting point SpaceX\'s prediction that it will launch 148 times in 2024. Rounding that number down to a more conservative 140 missions (recall that SpaceX fell just a bit short of its own launch target in 2023 as well), Payload proceeds to break them down by mission type -- and probable revenue.', ""Here's how that looks:"", 'Add it all up, and SpaceX might generate $5.5 billion in revenue from rocket launches this year.', ""And yet, launch is only one part of SpaceX's business these days -- and not even the biggest part. Already, SpaceX's Starlink satellite internet business has become a bigger revenue driver for the space company. In 2024, Payload calculates that between selling terminals and providing Starlink service to its customers, SpaceX will rake in another $6.8 billion."", 'Mix in about $1 billion in extra revenue from assorted other SpaceX ventures -- demonstrating in-orbit refueling procedures for NASA\'s ""Tipping Point"" project, supporting a private astronaut Polaris Dawn mission, recording revenue for its work on the Project Artemis moon landing effort, and providing military communications services via its new Starshield division -- and Payload calculates that SpaceX revenue will pass $13.3 billion this year.', ""According to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence, that's more money than defense contracting giant Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) generated from its space business last year, meaning that 2024 could be the year SpaceX truly becomes a giant itself."", ""That fact alone seems pretty impressive. Just as impressive is the wildfire success of Starlink -- which didn't even exist just four years ago, and is now SpaceX's biggest money-maker. It's still growing, and actually growing faster than SpaceX's launch business. According to Payload's estimates, SpaceX launch revenue is likely to grow 56% year over year in 2024, while Starlink revenue might grow 63%."", 'Most impressive of all, though, is how profitable this business has become. Taking Bloomberg\'s estimate at face value (with support from Payload\'s own description of SpaceX\'s profits as ""significant""), it would appear that in 2023 alone, SpaceX generated an adjusted profit margin of nearly 35%. For comparison, Lockheed Martin\'s space business eked out an operating profit margin of less than 9% last year.', ""In 2024, therefore, assuming levels of profitability similar to what it achieved in 2023, SpaceX revenue of $13.3 billion could grow SpaceX's operating profits past $4.5 billion -- a year-over-year increase of 50%. Placed alongside the company's latest reported private market value of $180 billion, this means SpaceX stock is selling for a rich 40 times forward earnings. (Remember, these are forward adjusted operating earnings. Net income for SpaceX after taxes would presumably be lower than $4.5 billion, and the company's GAAP price-to-earnings ratio accordingly higher.)"", 'Does paying that valuation make sense for investors? Even if you could find a way to invest in privately held SpaceX, should you even want to?', 'I\'m not 100% certain on this point, but based on Payload\'s latest numbers, I\'m leaning toward the ""yes"" camp. For one thing, paying even 40-plus times earnings for a company growing at 50% seems no worse than fair value to me. For another thing, all the data seems to confirm that SpaceX is far and away the most profitable space company out there. And as SpaceX continues to evolve and build its moat -- with Starship, with Starlink, and most recently with its announcement of Starshield for the military -- I see little near-term risk of any competitors catching up.', '""Top dog and first mover"" seems to be a description that fits this company to a ""T."" And I, for one, can hardly wait until SpaceX confirms its long-promised Starlink IPO, and gives investors a chance to own the fastest part of this fast-growing business.', 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team\xa0has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

As Ireland is a member state of the European Union, operating there gives companies ready access to that common market. With Ireland's low corporate tax rate, it's fairly easy for companies looking for that European presence to justify setting up a portion of their operations there. Of course, Ireland's physical separation from the rest of the continent does make things a bit difficult logistically, but many global businesses have found a way to make it work."", ""In honor of St. Patrick's Day, with St. Patrick being the Patron Saint of Ireland, three Motley Fool contributors went looking for companies with a strong Irish presence to help celebrate the day. They picked Diageo (NYSE: DEO), Medtronic (NYSE: MDT), and Accenture (NYSE: ACN). Read on to find out why, and decide for yourself whether their operations on the Emerald Isle help make them worthy of your investment consideration."", 'Chuck Saletta (Diageo): Diageo\'s Guinness brand and the Republic of Ireland share a very important symbol in common -- the ""Brian Boru"" harp. The beer brand first registered that harp as a trademark in 1876, and Ireland later adopted it as its national emblem in 1922. The key difference between the two? The Guinness harp has the sound board on the left-hand side, while the Irish emblem has it on the right.', 'With a tie that deep in Irish culture, it should be no surprise that Diageo still maintains a strong presence in Ireland. The company exports around €1 billion (nearly $1.1 billion USD) of beer and Baileys Irish Cream each year from Ireland. It also buys around €275 million in goods and services from within the country and employs around 1,200 people there .', ""For a sense of just how deep Guinness is integrated into Irish culture, its founder -- Arthur Guinness -- signed a 9,000-year lease back in 1759 on a property at St. James Gate in Dublin. The company still maintains a brewery there, and with over 8,700 years remaining on its lease, it's very likely that Guinness will keep an Irish presence for quite some time to come."", ""Overall, Diageo's commitment to Ireland is strong and dates back hundreds of years. With very well-known Irish-initiated brands and a multi-millennium lease on some pretty important real estate, the company has a very strong incentive to stay in the Emerald Isle for many more centuries."", ""Eric Volkman (Medtronic): Following its acquisition of Irish peer Covidien in 2015, medical device maker Medtronic established its legal headquarters in the country. Medtronic is one of the most prominent companies in its segment, and its relatively large presence in Ireland makes it one of the nation's largest businesses, period."", 'Its operational and executive headquarters are in its native Minneapolis, however, and this positions Medtronic at the heart of the U.S. market. This is advantageous because our population as a whole is aging. And when a population ages, it tends to require more medical care, often involving the myriad devices the company sells.', ""While the company isn't the only medical device maker on the scene, it's well established and is always a major player in its segment."", ""A strong market for its goods and disciplined management combine to make for a business that throws off a lot of cash. The company's free cash flow (FCF) habitually lands in the billions of dollars -- over the past five years its annual FCF figure hasn't dipped below $4.58 billion, and at one point soared just above $6 billion."", ""This pile is more than enough to fund a constantly rising dividend that has been lifted at least once every year for 46 years running, plus relatively modest share repurchase programs. That's a tough one-two combination to pull off even for the most successful businesses, and it's a sign that Medtronic knows how to effectively make a buck in its specialty."", ""Some would consider Medtronic's payout to be in high-yield dividend territory, at a current rate of 3.2%. That's notably above the current 1.4% average of S&P 500 index component stocks."", ""Jason Hall (Accenture): If there are any two things true in business, it's that technological breakthroughs will continue to happen, and companies will need expertise to figure out how to use that technology to improve their business. As the saying goes, you either evolve, or you die. The problem for most companies is that they dedicate their resources to being really good at what their business is, and don't often have the capacity to employ experts to keep them at the leading edge of technologies and innovations that power all the other parts of their business."", ""This is where Accenture comes in. Companies use consultants because they both have an understanding of the industry and competitive landscape of their clients and also are experts in something the company itself isn't. In the case of Accenture, it's technology. With its roots in the late 1970s, the company has a long history of helping its clients evolve and leverage new technologies, and has made those technologies part of its strategy."", ""Over the past decade, that was largely built around mobile computing, the cloud, and analytics. But as we move ahead, AI, robotics, and quantum computing are where Accenture's customers can leverage its expertise. For example, it secured $450 million in new bookings in the first quarter for generative AI. This may not sound like much against its $18.4 billion in bookings in the quarter, but it's a strong start to securing its place in this nascent trend."", ""With corporate headquarters in Dublin, Accenture does benefit from lower corporate taxes. But as it's a truly global tech consulting giant, investors can benefit from its deep history of tech leadership well into the future."", ""This St. Patrick's Day, take a moment to step back from any celebrations to consider the companies that have found a home in the country that is most associated with St. Patrick. As Diageo, Medtronic, and Accenture show, great things can come from small island countries."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Diageo Plc right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Diageo Plc, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Diageo Plc wasn’t one of them.

Just after 10 AM, Rob Turkewitz was sitting in a tony lawyers’ office downtown, waiting for his client John Barnett to testify—and further his crusade for safety in the skies. “My co-counsel Brian Knowles and I were gathered around a conference table alongside Boeing's in-house counsel, and its trial lawyer from Ogletree, Deakens. It was in Ogletree’s offices, much fancier than ours, what you’d call a ‘grand door.’”"", 'Turkewitz wasn’t totally surprised that Barnett was late for this round of depositions. “Downtown Charleston was flooded by one of the worst rainstorms I’ve ever seen,” he recalls. “I’d called John’s room at the Holiday Inn where he was staying at 9 AM to see if he wanted me to pick him up, but he didn’t answer.”', 'Turkewitz was especially buzzed about this session because Barnett was slated to continue the account of the production gaffes he’d allegedly witnessed up-close on the Boeing factory floor, a dramatic narrative that he’d started the previous day. Barnett, 62, had worked from 2011 to 2017 as a quality manager at the North Charleston plant that assembles the 787 Dreamliner. In that role, he’d alerted senior managers to what he called violations of legally required processes and procedures, and maintained that his warnings were being ignored. In the years following his departure, Barnett emerged as arguably the most renowned Boeing whistleblower, recounting the quality abuses he’d claimed to have witnessed to multiple media outlets.', 'Barnett’s charges had drawn fresh attention in the wake of the January 737 MAX door-plug blowout on Alaska Airlines flight 1282 just after takeoff from Portland, Ore., followed by a string of other mishaps on Boeing aircraft. In interviews after the big bang over Portland, Barnett had been scathing in his criticism of Boeing’s safety lapses, and attributed the catastrophe to the types of sloppy practices he said that he’d witnessed and flagged years earlier at the North Charleston plant.', 'In the action that brought Barnett across the table from Boeing’s attorneys in Charleston, he was suing the planemaker in a so-called AIR21 case. His charge: Boeing had violated U.S. Department of Labor statutes stipulating that it’s unlawful to retaliate against a whistleblower. Barnett was seeking compensation for allegedly being forced to retire ten years before he planned to leave Boeing, getting blackballed from the promotions he deserved because of what he argued were justified warnings that his bosses failed to heed, and undergoing harassment on the job that left him suffering from PTSD and panic attacks.', 'The previous day, Barnett had been on a roll as a video camera recorded the event. “John testified for four hours in questioning by my co-counsel Brian,” says Turkewitz. “This was following seven hours of cross examination by Boeing’s lawyers on Thursday. He was really happy to be telling his side of the story, excited to be fielding our questions, doing a great job. It was explosive stuff. As I’m sitting there, I’m thinking, ‘This is the best witness I’ve ever seen.’” At one point, says Turkewitz, the Boeing lawyer protested that Barnett was reciting the details of incidents from a decade ago, and specific dates, without looking at documents. As Turkevitz recalls the exchange, Barnett fired back, ""I know these documents inside out. I’ve had to live it.""', 'That Friday, Barnett’s testimony ended at around 5 PM, and the parties reconvened an hour later. “John was really tired and didn’t want to testify any more that day,” says Turkewitz. “He wanted to drive home to Louisiana starting that evening, as he had planned. He\'d told his mom that he\'d be home on Sunday, and it took him two days to drive home. I suggested that we break for a week or two. But the Boeing lawyers took the position that no more depositions could be taken until Barnett completed his testimony. Turkewitz didn\'t think the judge would stand for that restriction. ""We had a March 30 deadline for completing the depositions, there was a list of 20 witnesses from both sides. On our list were around eight witnesses who\'d worked with John and backed his eyewitness version of events at the plant. We knew Boeing would file a motion for summary judgment, and we wanted to lay out through John\'s testimony that he was subjected to a hostile work environment.” (Boeing did not respond to a request to comment for this story.)', 'For Barnett, passion for the cause surmounted the fatigue from two days of intense questioning. According to Turkewitz, he told the lawyers, ‘Let’s just get it done. I’ve already been waiting for seven years.’” ', 'Shortly after 10 AM, Turkewitz called the Holiday Inn. “I asked if he’d checked out, and they said no,” he recounts. “I asked to be put through to the room, and the phone just kept ringing, so I then asked that they check the room. They Holiday Inn folks said ‘His stuff’s packed up, but he’s not there.’” Turkewitz asked that they look for his car, a “Clemson Orange” Dodge Ram truck. ""The manager came back and told me, \'His truck is still there, and we called EMS. I can\'t tell you anything more.\'"" At that point, the lawyers around the conference table feared that Barnett could have suffered a heart attack.', 'Turkewitz then called the manager back, and she said that she couldn\'t provide any additional information, and that a police officer would give him a call. Around 20 minutes later, at exactly 11:11, he got the call. ""The officer asked whom I was, and how many times I\'d called John that morning,"" says Turkewitz. ""I asked her, \'Is John okay? Can you at least tell us if he\'s alive?"" The officer replied, ""I\'m sorry, but I can\'t provide that information to you."" Recalls Turkewitz, “That’s when I knew that this is not good.”', 'At that point, all four attorneys drove to the Holiday Inn to witness a parking lot crowded with volunteer emergency vehicles and police cars. ""John\'s truck was blocked from view by emergency vehicles. I was asked to keep a distance,"" says Turkewitz. According to press reports, Barnett was found in the Ram with a silver pistol still in his hand, his finger on the trigger. The Charleston County Coroner ruled the cause of death as “a self-inflicted wound,” and a police report disclosed that “a white piece of paper resembling a note” lay in plain view on the passenger seat. Its contents haven’t been disclosed.', ""To Turkewitz and Knowles, Barnett’s lawyers and friends for seven years, the tragedy was incomprehensible. “He was in a good mood the evening before, so looking forward to testifying on Saturday,” says Turkewitz. “Although he was tired, I saw no sign he was in distress.” Turkewitz and Knowles said in a statement, “We didn’t see any indication that he would take his own life. No one can believe it. The Charleston police need to investigate this fully and accurately and tell the public. No detail can be left unturned.” Two detectives from the City of Charleston Police Department are currently conducting an investigation into Barnett's death."", 'The Barnett family, which includes his older brother Rodney, issued a statement reading that “He was looking forward to having his day in court and hoping it would force Boeing to change its culture. He was suffering from PTSD and anxiety attacks as a result of being subjected to a hostile work environment at Boeing, which we believe led to his death.”', ""Boeing released the following statement: “We are saddened by Mr. Barnett’s passing, and our thoughts are with his family and friends.” Boeing didn't provide further comment on Barnett or the issues he raised beyond referring Fortune to that statement."", 'Barnett grew up the youngest of four brothers raised by a loving and firm mother in the Crossroads region of Louisiana.\xa0He lived near Seattle for twenty-five years of his 32 year Boeing career while working at the Everett plant that produced the 747, 767, and 777. After leaving Boeing, he settled back home alongside an extended family that included his brother Rodney and cherished nieces in Pineville, La., a hamlet northwest of Baton Rouge that bills itself as a haven where “southern hospitality abounds.” While in Washington, Barnett relished racing stock cars at the Evergreen Speedway. The lead photo on the funeral home tribute page displays Barnett posing before a lime green roadster, helmet tucked under one arm.', 'Nicknamed “Swamp Dawg” by his racing buddies, Barnett sported a alligator-jaws tatoo on his right upper torso, shoulder-length brown hair, and an adjoining walrus mustache and goatee. A photo posted online shows him joyfully piloting a speedboat in a form-fitting cutoff nylon tee-shirt, sporting aviator shades. Friends and family recall his infectious boisterous laugh, and on the tribute site, his nieces wrote that they’d tagged him as “Funcle,”’ short for “Fun Uncle.” Barnett wed for the second time after moving to Pineville. “He married Diane Johnson, his best friend,” says Turkewitz. “She died of brain cancer 18 months ago.” They met at Boeing, where Diane worked at both the Everett and later the North Charleston plant as a top liaison with the FAA. According to friends, she and John loved donning overalls and getting messy tuning the engine on his hot rods.', 'According to Turkewitz, Barnett was “the most decent person you could imagine. He was constantly doing things for people. He never met a stranger.”', 'During his years in Everett, Barnett was impressed by Boeing’s attention to quality and safety. “When I worked on the 747, 767, and 777 in Everett, those are beautiful planes, and the people there fully understood what it took to build a safe and airworthy aircraft,” Barnett stated for a 2019 story in Corporate Crime Reporter. In 2011, according to Turkewitz, a senior Boeing quality manager specifically recruited Barnett as a prime force in imposing the same types of processes and procedures at the giant new 787 plant in North Charleston that had been so successful in Everett.', ""In the Corporate Crime Reporter interview, Barnett discussed both the vast gulf in culture between North Charleston and Everett, and three major safety issues that he uncovered, and that in his telling, management not only ignored, but punished him for reporting. “The entire team came down…from the military side,” he said, referring to the company's defense business. “Their motto was, we’re in Charleston and we can do anything we want. They started pressuring us not to document defects, to work outside procedures, to allow defective material to be installed without being corrected. They just wanted to push planes out the door and make the cash register ring.” Emblematic of the blowsy mindset, he noted in a later interview, “Was that the whole place smelled of French fries.”"", 'The first problem, he related, involved clusters of razor-sharp, titanium slivers that fell onto the surface that supported the electronic equipment controlling power to the airplane. These more or less three-inch shards peeled off titanium threads when workers installed the titanium bolts that secured the floor board above the surface supporting the power gear in these fly-by-wire planes. Barnett filed a complaint with management. The FAA then performed multiple audits and found the slivers in all ten planes inspected. The FAA blocked Boeing from delivering planes with shards, but according to Barnett did not consider that the scraps posed a safety issue on the 800 planes already delivered (Barnett claimed that the issue could have triggered a catastrophic event).', 'The second issue involved the emergency oxygen equipment. Barnett’s team found that 25% of the systems didn’t work properly, so that when the masks fell from the ceiling in the event of an accident that caused decompression, the cylinders would fail to send oxygen to the passengers. According to Barnett, management stonewalled on his report. He also alerted the FAA. Boeing later disclosed that its own investigation revealed that some of the oxygen masks were not working.', 'Third, Barnett states that Boeing wasn’t keeping proper track of parts shipped from suppliers that it found defective. “Many of them were lost or shown to have been installed on the airplane without being repaired,” he says in the Corporate Crime piece. “We didn’t know where a lot of them went. Some of them were significant structural components…such as on the aft pressure bulkheads.” Barnett says that he filed a whole series of internal warnings on the defective parts problem, first by discussing it with managers, then going to HR, and finally lodging a complaint to the ethics group.', 'After filing his complaints, Barnett was reassigned to a kind of exile to a section called Material Review Segregation Area or MRSA, ironically the storage site for those non-conforming parts. Barnett claims that he fought a rear-guard battle to prevent workers from accessing those defective components (when shipments of new parts were slow, for example) and installing them in the planes. “They isolated me from the other quality managers,” he says. “I was basically by myself. They were constantly denigrating me. I could do nothing right. My complaints seemed to go into a black hole.”', 'Barnett’s managers, in his words, also “reprimanded” him for “documenting process violations,”\xa0and told him that the company didn’t want him putting problems in writing.', '“I was going through health issues and having anxiety attacks,” he explains. “I had gone as far as I could go inside the company. I had to go outside.” In early 2017 while in the wilderness of MRSA, Barnett filed an AIR21 whistleblower complaint with The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). He cited the ignored safety complaints as well as Boeing’s alleged hostility resulting from his drumbeat of warnings. He also charge the Boeing blocked him from being transferred from the North Charleston plant. Weeks later, his health had deteriorated to the point where he resigned. “His doctor told him that if he didn’t quit his job at Boeing, he could die of a heart attack,” says Turkewitz.', 'As it turned out, OSHA found the facts presented in Barnett’s case insufficient to rule against Boeing. “OSHA is handicapped because they don’t have the authority to subpoena documents,” says Turkewitz. In 2021, Boeing issued a statement that read, “Boeing has in no way negatively impacted Mr. Barnett’s ability to continue whatever chosen profession he chooses.” Barnett and his legal team filed an amended complaint to the Department of Labor, still under the AIR21 whistleblower retaliation statute, seeking more than $1 million in damages for lost income from his claim of being effectively forced from his job and denied promotion, and additional compensation for emotional distress, the case in which he’d testified in the days before his death.', ""It's important to emphasize that the two fatal 737 crashes that killed 346 passengers and crew in 2018 and 2019, and the Portland accident, all happened on 737s, not on the 787, the aircraft Barnett worked on in North Charleston. Still, Barnett viewed the 737 program as suffering from precisely the same ills as he says he witnessed on the 787 production. During his last media interview with TMZ in late January, Barnett discussed the quality regime that led to the disaster on Alaska Airlines Flight 1282. “This is not a 737 problem, this is a Boeing problem,” he intoned. “I know the FAA has done due diligence and inspections. My concern is for the condition of the rest of the plane. What I’ve seen with the door plug is what I’ve seen with the rest of the plane in terms of jobs not being completed properly, inspection steps removed, issues being ignored. The 737 and 787 programs have really embraced the theory that quality is overhead and non-value added.”"", 'For Turkewitz, Barnett\'s death is a huge loss in the fight for protecting airborne passengers and crew, as well as a tragedy for his friends and family. ""On that last day, John was looking so forward to getting the case behind him and living a life dedicated to promoting airline safety,"" says Turkewitz. As for the case against Boeing, Turkewitz insists that Barnett’s tragic passing may not mark the death of his late client’s heroic campaign. “We’re planning to substitute John’s estate, his family, for John,” says Turkewitz. The “Funcle” whose elan seemed to fill the pool where he splashed happily with his nieces is gone. But with every new mishap at Boeing, the legacy of this maverick-whistleblower rises in stature.', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Some saw their market caps soar by 1,000%. Those sudden rises were followed by dramatic falls, as many fintech stocks gave back all those gains.', ""This looks like a fantastic time to buy certain fintech stocks -- prominent among them, Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU). While it's not as cheap as some of the other options out there, it is, in my view, arguably the best place to invest $1,000 right now. During the coming years, its shares have tremendous upside potential as the company executes on its growth plans."", ""Fintech businesses are exactly what they sound like: They combine financial services with technology. When they're managed right and offer compelling services, these businesses can grow rapidly for years, if not decades."", 'Consider PayPal. When it went public for the first time in early 2002, its services were revolutionary. Users could transfer money across the world in seconds. They could also use PayPal to safely buy and sell products and services online. At the time, relatively few people felt safe entering their credit card numbers into a computer. PayPal took the worry out of online transactions by creating a technological intermediary. If there was a problem with an order, PayPal could provide recourse.', ""Today, PayPal has more than 400 million active users. That's greater than the population of the U.S. And while its active user base has recently begun to shrink, PayPal enjoyed roughly two decades of consistent user growth. Financial services in general is a big business. When fintech companies like PayPal find ways to disrupt the status quo through clever technology and marketing, investors can generate huge profits."", ""The most promising fintech stock today is Nu Holdings. This company isn't all promise, either. It has a decade-long track record of success, and it built a multibillion-dollar business from scratch."", ""Nu was created in 2013 to disrupt Latin America's banking industry. At the time, the financial services market in the region was controlled by a handful of powerful players. These incumbents had no reason to rock the boat. They charged high premiums for simple services and earned reliable profits along the way without needing to invest in innovation."", 'Nu flipped everything on its head by forgoing physical branches, offering its services directly to anyone with a smartphone. As Doug Leone -- a partner at Sequoia Capital, an early investor in Nu -- explained, ""At first, the competition failed to take Nubank seriously; they didn\'t understand the deep technological work involved in the backend of the deceptively simple user experience, and thought the company was nothing more than an app.""', ""After going from zero customers in 2013 to 95 million today, Nu is clearly more than an app. Its customers not only turn to Nu for credit and debit cards, but also for insurance, personal loans, checking and savings accounts, and even crypto investing. None of the incumbent banks in its markets have come even close to replicating Nu's business model. The company now has technological and reputational advantages that its competitors will find difficult to match for years to come."", 'When it comes to high-quality businesses with durable competitive advantages, Nu is a prime case study.', 'Building off a strong foundation, Nu has two promising pillars of growth that should deliver healthy returns to shareholders during the next decade and beyond.', 'The first pillar of growth will be replicating its business model in new markets. Initially focused on Brazil, Nu expanded into Mexico and Columbia, where it experienced similar success. In its first seven months operating in Mexico, for example, Nu amassed deposits of more than $1 billion. Simply by expanding into nearby countries like Peru, Argentina, Ecuador, and Chile, Nu can increase its potential customer base by up to 100 million people.', ""The second pillar of growth for Nu will involve delivering more products and services to existing customers. To track its success in doing so, the company monitors and publishes its average revenue per active customer (ARPAC). Since its founding, that metric has increased nearly every quarter. That's due to two factors. First, it has launched new financial services like insurance and personal loans. Because Nu's services are accessible via smartphone, new products become immediately available for adoption across its entire user base. Second, the company has gradually acquired a positive reputation, and thus is enjoying stronger engagement from its users.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. So on that note, Molson Coors Beverage (NYSE:TAP) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Molson Coors Beverage is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.072 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$26b - US$4.1b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""So, Molson Coors Beverage has an ROCE of 7.2%.  Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Beverage industry average of 17%."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Molson Coors Beverage ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for Molson Coors Beverage compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Molson Coors Beverage ."", ""Molson Coors Beverage is showing promise given that its ROCE is trending up and to the right. More specifically, while the company has kept capital employed relatively flat over the last five years, the ROCE has climbed 27% in that same time. So it's likely that the business is now reaping the full benefits of its past investments, since the capital employed hasn't changed considerably. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking."", ""To sum it up, Molson Coors Beverage is collecting higher returns from the same amount of capital, and that's impressive. Investors may not be impressed by the favorable underlying trends yet because over the last five years the stock has only returned 28% to shareholders.

In more good news, the share price has risen 11% in thirty days. We note that Royal Caribbean Cruises reported its financial results recently; luckily, you can catch up on the latest revenue and profit numbers in our company report. And shareholders have also done well over the long term, with an increase of 42% in the last three years."", ""With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies."", ' See our latest analysis for Royal Caribbean Cruises ', ""While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational.

Berkshire Hathaway owns a portfolio of about 50 stocks, in addition to several whole companies. Investors looking to beat the market can get great ideas from following Buffett's picks and listening to his many nuggets of wisdom. If you have $300 to invest after paying off debts and saving for an emergency fund, Visa (NYSE: V), Nu Holdings (NYSE: NU), and Floor & Decor (NYSE: FND) are excellent Buffett stocks to buy right now."", ""Visa has carved out a wide niche in credit card processing with one of Buffett's favorite features: a long-term competitive advantage. It's the largest credit card processing network in the world, with more than $15 trillion in trailing 12-month transaction volume and more than 4.3 billion cards worldwide."", ""Equally importantly, it hasn't stopped upgrading for a moment. Although it has a wide economic moat right now, it's not without competition that could easily replace it if it slacks off. Chief Executive Officer Ryan McInerney came onto the job last year, but he's a Visa veteran continuing the company's strategy of forging strong relationships with partner institutions and developing new technology to stay on top of its game."", 'With its dominant position in the global economy, Visa enjoys growth with the economy, making it a top forever stock. In general, its performance mirrors the economy; when people have money to spend, Visa does well, getting a small cut every time a cardholder swipes their card. The inverse of that is true as well, but Visa has been demonstrating strong growth despite current economic volatility. Some of it is a result of the rebound from pandemic-related declines, illustrated by increasing cross-border volume. Total revenue increased 9% year over year in the 2024 fiscal first quarter (ended Dec. 31) to $8.6 billion, and earnings per share (EPS) rose 20% over last year to $2.39.', 'Visa has incredible and unmatched profit margins that reached 57% in the first quarter, meaning it turned more than half of every dollar of revenue into profit. It also pays a dividend that it steadily increases.', 'Visa has been a market-beating stock for years, and it should continue to reward investors.', ""The digital bank Nu Holdings is one of the only growth stocks in the value-oriented Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. It has some standard Buffett-stock characteristics -- it's a financial company with lots of cash. But it's reporting high growth and capturing share in its home market of Brazil, as well as its newer markets in Mexico and Colombia."", ""Revenue increased 57% year over year in the 2023 fourth quarter, and it added 4.8 million new accounts for a total of 94 million. Not only do the new accounts drive higher revenue, but Nu has a strategy of upselling and cross-selling new products, converting lower-paying customers into highly engaged users who spend more time with Nu's products and more money on its platform. Average revenue per active customer (ARPAC) continued to increase sequentially, rising from $8.20 last year to $10.60 this year's fourth quarter."", ""This also feeds into a profitability cycle. Nu wasn't profitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis when it went public in 2021, but it has now reported six consecutive quarters of net income, increasing from $58 million in the 2022 fourth quarter to $361 million last's comparable period."", ""Nu also has excellent credit risk management, which is helping it succeed despite regional economic problems. Brazil's economy has been even more volatile than the U.S.'s, with higher inflation and interest rates that exceed 10%. Nu's deposits increased 38% year over year in the fourth quarter to $23.7 billion, and its interest-earning portfolio increased 91% to $8.2 billion."", 'Nu is becoming one of best growth stocks to own, and it should continue to beat the market for the foreseeable future.', ""Floor & Decor is a fairly small warehouse-style chain of stores that sell flooring products. So what caught Buffett's attention? Sometimes it's the simplest models that offer the greatest potential. Floor & Decor is small, and that's precisely why it looks compelling. It's expanding at a fast rate, but it has years of growth ahead just from opening new stores. Before inflation took off in 2022, it was reporting strong comparable sales (comps) growth, which indicates a viable concept with long-term growth potential. That growth has been slowing, and Floor & Decor is feeling pressure across its business right now. But smart investors see the bigger picture."", ""Sales increased 3.5% year over year for full-year 2023, but comps decreased 7.1%. Operating margin was 7.3%, 2 percentage points lower than the year before, and EPS decreased 18% to $2.28. For 2024, management is projecting a sales increase of about 6.4%, with comps down about 3.5%, and EPS of about $1.95. Fourth-quarter EPS of $0.34, although down from 2022, beat Wall Street's expectations of $0.26 by a meaningful margin."", ""The company opened 31 stores last year, and it's planning to open 30 to 35 new stores this year. It operated 221 stores as of the end of 2023, and believes it can reach 500 stores during the next eight or so years."", 'These new stores provide revenue growth opportunities while comps are pressured. In addition to inflation, which makes it harder for customers to make large purchases like flooring, the home improvement industry has been hurt by rising interest rates and a slow housing market. But this is the kind of cyclical pressure that most companies will feel at different points.', ""Floor & Decor has a long growth runway in new stores, and it operates an efficient model.

In recent months, her plan to turn Under Armour around was becoming increasingly clear.', 'Linnartz added key talent to the roles of chief commercial officer, chief communications officer (one-time comms person to former PayPal CEO Dan Schulman), chief product officer, chief design officer (celebrated fashion designer John Varvatos), chief supply chain officer, president of Americas, president of EMEA, and chief marketing officer.', 'Her “Protect This House 3” strategy focused on improving product design, expanding in the lucrative athleisure market, and returning to growth in the US. Linnartz even channeled her Marriott Bonvoy experience by debuting a UA Rewards program.', ""Amid all the rebuilding, I spent a few hours with Linnartz at Under Armour's Baltimore headquarters a few weeks ago."", 'We had a wide-ranging chat as we walked through the enormous corporate gym, basketball court, and offices.', 'We talked about her vision for Under Armour and why it will win the battle with Lululemon (LULU), and she showed me some great styles coming down the pike.', ""She reflected on her hard work at her family's modest hotel business growing up and expressed excitement about the new headquarters Under Armour would be moving into nearby. The space will signify a new chapter for Under Armour, Linnartz told me."", ""Above all else, Linnartz struck the note I was looking for on culture — leaving me hopeful that Under Armour by 2026 wouldn't be a $2 stock (it's around $8 today)."", '""First and most important thing I deeply believe in is servant leadership. As the CEO, my job is to serve the team and the teammates. And when I have that attitude, then I can be welcomed by the team and I can enable the team,"" Linnartz said.', 'Coming up on her one year mark, she has settled into the CEO role, and investors were beginning to buy in.

Others on the Street told me Plank just can\'t get out of his own way.', 'To say Plank is the cultural opposite of Linnartz is an understatement.', 'Plank deserves full credit for working hard to bring Under Armour to life — the guy was selling T-shirts out of his car in the late 1990s. He is unquestionably an American success story, and to that, I tip my black UA baseball hat.', 'But he is also totally the wrong person to be leading Under Armour into the next decade, in large part because of his checkered resume for driving cultural excellence inside the company.', 'He also missed several key consumer trends, coming late to the sneakers and athleisure parties, essentially handing the market to Lululemon while strengthening Nike (NKE).

A key aspect of my strategy is to grow my passive income streams. I'm working toward generating enough income to offset my recurring expenses."", ""I still have a long way to go, but I'm making steady progress. I'm doing that by investing in high-quality dividend stocks, focusing on those with higher-yielding payouts that steadily rise. I recently bought a few more shares of Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Realty Income (NYSE: O), and Verizon (NYSE: VZ). Here's why I believe they will help me on my journey toward financial freedom."", 'Chevron is an elite dividend stock. The oil giant has increased its payout for 37 straight years. It has grown its dividend faster than the S&P 500 over the last five years and at more than double the rate of its closest peer. Its most recent boost was a solid 8%. ', 'I firmly believe Chevron can continue growing its attractive dividend (it currently yields 4.2%). In recent years, the company has sharpened its investment focus on its highest-return opportunities. That bolsters its view that it can increase its free cash flow per share by more than 10% annually through 2027. This forecast assumes that oil will average around $60 per barrel. It would give the oil giant the cash to continue investing in high-return expansion projects, increasing its dividend, and repurchasing shares at the low end of its $10 billion-$20 billion target range. ', 'Chevron could grow its free cash flow even faster at higher prices (crude is currently over $80 a barrel). Meanwhile, it has agreed to buy rival Hess in a roughly $60 billion deal. That acquisition would enhance and extend its growth outlook into the 2030s. Chevron believes it could double its free cash flow by 2027 at $70 oil if it closes its Hess acquisition. Given these factors, Chevron should have more than enough fuel to continue paying and raising its high-yielding dividend. ', 'Realty Income has lived up to its name over the years. The real estate investment trust (REIT) has supplied its investors with durable dividend income. It pays a monthly dividend, which it has increased 124 times since its public-market listing in 1994, including the last 106 consecutive quarters. It has boosted that payout at a 4.3% annual rate. ', 'The REIT should have no problem continuing to increase its high-yielding payout (currently 6%). It aims to grow its adjusted funds from operations (FFO) per share by 4% to 5% annually. Acquisitions are the main expansion driver. Realty Income invests billions of dollars each year to acquire and develop additional income-producing real estate. The company has lots of financial flexibility to fund new deals thanks to its conservative dividend payout ratio (roughly 75% of its adjusted FFO) and elite balance sheet. ', 'Realty Income has a massive growth runway. The total addressable market for properties it could acquire across the U.S. and Europe is a staggering $13.9 trillion. It has lengthened that runway by expanding into new property verticals like data centers, gaming, and additional European countries. ', 'Verizon is a monster dividend stock. The telecom giant currently yields 6.7%. That hefty payout is on an increasingly firm foundation.', 'The company generates significant cash flow. It produced $37.5 billion in cash flow from operations in 2023, easily covering its $18.8 billion in capital expenditures and $11 billion in dividend payments. That enabled it to generate excess free cash to further strengthen its already solid investment-grade balance sheet. ', 'Verizon should continue producing strong free cash flow in the future. It has invested heavily in building its 5G infrastructure, which should increase its revenue and cash flow. Meanwhile, capital spending is coming down (it should be between $17 billion and $17.5 billion in 2024). The telecom is also working to cut $2 billion to $3 billion in operating costs by 2025, while interest expenses should fall as it repays debt. These catalysts should grow its free cash flow, enabling Verizon to continue raising its dividend, something it has done for 17 straight years. ', ""Chevron, Realty Income, and Verizon check all the boxes for me. The two biggest are that they pay higher-yielding dividends that should continue rising in the future. That's why I recently bought a few more shares. I expect to continue adding to these positions because I believe they'll help me on my quest to reach financial freedom through passive income."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Chevron right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Chevron, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chevron wasn’t one of them.

Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. In this article, we decided to focus on NVIDIA's  ROE."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders."", ' See our latest analysis for NVIDIA ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for NVIDIA is:', '69% = US$30b ÷ US$43b (Based on the trailing twelve months to January 2024).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.69."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don\'t necessarily bear these characteristics.', ""Firstly, we acknowledge that NVIDIA has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 14% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. So, the substantial 39% net income growth seen by NVIDIA over the past five years isn't overly surprising."", ""We then compared NVIDIA's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 29% in the same 5-year period."", ""The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. One good indicator of expected earnings growth is the P/E ratio which determines the price the market is willing to pay for a stock based on its earnings prospects. So, you may want to check if NVIDIA is trading on a high P/E or a low P/E, relative to its industry."", 'NVIDIA has a really low three-year median payout ratio of 5.2%, meaning that it has the remaining 95% left over to reinvest into its business. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company.', ""Besides, NVIDIA has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 0.5% over the next three years. Still forecasts suggest that NVIDIA's future ROE will drop to 51% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to decrease. This suggests that there could be other factors could driving the anticipated decline in the company's ROE."", ""On the whole, we feel that NVIDIA's performance has been quite good. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth.

SoundHound's namesake app is used to identify and discover songs, while its Houndify developer platform enables companies to create their own speech-recognition tools. Super Micro Computer, more commonly known as Supermicro, is a leading producer of AI servers."", ""Both companies have close ties to Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia was one of SoundHound's earliest backers prior to its public debut in 2022, and it recently made another investment in the company. Supermicro's partnership with Nvidia grants it access to the chipmaker's top-tier data center graphics processing units (GPUs) before most of its competitors."", ""That's why both stocks soared alongside Nvidia's as the AI market expanded. Over the past 12 months, SoundHound's stock jumped 248% as Supermicro's stock rallied 1,150%. But should you invest in either of these high-flying AI stocks right now?"", ""SoundHound competes against Microsoft and Alphabet's Google in the audio and speech-recognition market, but its Houndify platform is an appealing option for companies that don't want to tether themselves to those tech giants."", ""Automakers like Hyundai and Stellantis, smart TV makers like Vizio, and fast-food chains like Church's Chicken all use Houndify to create custom voice-recognition services. That market should continue expanding as generative AI technologies become more sophisticated. It also recently acquired the restaurant-solutions provider SYNQ3 to expand its ecosystem."", 'SoundHound went public by merging with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in 2022. Its revenue rose 47% in both 2022 and 2023, and analysts expect its revenue to rise 51% to $69.5 million in 2024.', ""But based on those expectations and its enterprise value of $2.2 billion, SoundHound's stock still looks pricey at 32 times this year's sales. It's also unprofitable on a generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) basis, and it doesn't even expect its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to turn positive until 2025. Its high debt-to-equity ratio of 4.3 could also limit its ability to raise fresh cash."", 'Those issues could limit its upside potential as long as interest rates stay elevated, but it could still carve out a defensible niche in the evolving voice-recognition market and attract some buyout interest from its bigger competitors.', ""Supermicro isn't the world's largest producer of pre-built servers, but it differentiated itself from its larger competitors by building high-performance servers for tougher tasks. That focus made it an ideal partner for Nvidia, which worked with Supermicro to design AI servers which used its high-end data center GPUs. Nvidia's rival AMD has also been working with Supermicro to develop new AI servers for that booming market."", ""When Supermicro went public back in 2007, it didn't initially gain much attention because the server market was already heavily commoditized. But over the past few years, it became one of the market's hottest growth stocks as the generative AI market exploded and data center operators ramped up their orders of AI servers."", ""Supermicro's revenue soared 46% in fiscal 2022 (which ended in June 2022) and grew another 37% in fiscal 2023. Analysts expect its revenue to rise 104% in fiscal 2024 as the market's demand for new AI servers consistently outstrips its available supply. For fiscal 2025, they expect revenue to rise another 36% to $19.8 billion."", ""Supermicro ended its latest quarter with a low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.8. It's profitable, and analysts expect its earnings per share (EPS) to soar 86% in 2024 and 35% in 2025. Its stock still looks reasonably valued relative to those expectations at 37 times forward earnings and 3 times next year's sales. But the AI market needs to keep expanding -- and Supermicro needs to consistently grow its share of the AI server market -- for the company to reach those targets and support its rising valuations."", ""Both of these AI companies are growing rapidly, but Supermicro is clearly a better buy than SoundHound AI. Supermicro has a more established business; it has a wider moat; it's more profitable; and its stock looks cheaper. SoundHound might have gained some fresh attention with Nvidia's investment, but it hasn't proven that its business model is sustainable yet."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in SoundHound AI right now?', 'Before you buy stock in SoundHound AI, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and SoundHound AI wasn’t one of them.

The company is worth a whopping $2.2 trillion as of this writing, with $1.5 trillion of that value added within the last 12 months alone. Nvidia's recent success boils down to its data center chips designed for processing AI workloads, which continue to attract incredible demand."", ""But despite capturing the lion's share of investors' attention, Nvidia isn't the only opportunity in the semiconductor space. According to The Wall Street Journal, analysts have a consensus overweight (bullish) rating on two other names: Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Axcelis Technologies (NASDAQ: ACLS)."", ""Here's why owning shares of AMD and Axcelis might be a fantastic idea, too."", ""AMD's chips power some of the world's most popular consumer electronics, including Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox Series X, and even the infotainment systems in Tesla's electric vehicles. However, investors' attention is now on the data center."", ""The company has begun shipping its latest MI300 lineup of data center chips designed for AI workloads -- hardware that competes with Nvidia's industry-leading H100 graphics processing unit (GPU). The MI300 comes in two configurations: The MI300A combines GPU and CPU hardware to create an accelerated processing unit (APU), whereas the MI300X is a pure GPU."", 'The MI300A was selected by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to power its new El Capitan supercomputer, which is expected to be the fastest in the world when it comes online this year. However, AMD is also experiencing strong commercial demand for the MI300 range from leading data center operators like Oracle, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms.', ""The MI300 will likely send AMD's data center revenue soaring in the next few years. It won't be easy to catch Nvidia in that segment. However, AMD does have a 90% market share in AI-enabled personal computers. Its Ryzen 700 series (Ryzen AI) chips are designed to handle powerful AI workloads on-device, leading to faster response times for the end user because requests aren't traveling back and forth to the data center."", ""Millions of computers from leading manufacturers like Dell, HP, and Asus (among others) have already shipped with Ryzen AI chips. In the recent fourth quarter of 2023, Ryzen AI chips sent AMD's Client segment revenue soaring 62% year over year. The company plans to launch a new processor, which is up to three times faster than previous iterations, so this business is just getting warmed up."", ""Combined with a forecast $3.5 billion revenue contribution from the MI300 series in their first full year of sales, 2024 is set to be AMD's biggest year yet. It's no surprise that the majority of the 50 analysts tracked by The Wall Street Journal have given AMD stock the highest possible buy rating."", ""Axcelis Technologies isn't a glamorous producer of GPUs like Nvidia or AMD. In fact, it's relatively overlooked, with The Wall Street Journal tracking just eight analysts who cover its stock. Nevertheless, the majority of them have given it the highest possible buy rating, and it trades at a very attractive valuation right now, which might entice investors to follow the Street's lead."", 'Axcelis manufactures ion implantation equipment, which is critical to the chip fabrication process. Producers of silicon carbide power devices -- which regulate electric power in workloads with high currents -- are a significant source of demand for Axcelis at the moment, thanks especially to the electric vehicle industry. Silicon carbide chemistry is more efficient than traditional silicon chemistry, which leads to more mileage per battery charge and faster charging times.', 'The company is also preparing for growing demand from producers of AI-related semiconductors. Last year, the company noted that AI requires significantly more memory and storage capacity, which could make DRAM and NAND chips more complex to manufacture, and more expensive.', ""Axcelis generated a record $1.13 billion in revenue during 2023, representing a 22.9% year-over-year increase. But here's the kicker: The company ended 2023 with an order backlog worth $1.2 billion, so 2024 is shaping up to be another record year."", ""The stock is up over 400% in the last five years, but it has taken a breather over the last few months, suffering a 44% decline from its all-time high. That might spell opportunity, because based on the company's $7.43 in earnings per share in 2023, the stock now trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 14.6. That's a 59% discount to the 35.6 P/E ratio of the iShares Semiconductor ETF, so Axcelis' stock is substantially cheaper than the rest of the chip industry, on average."", ""Moreover, when you also consider Wall Street's bullish stance on Axcelis stock, there is a very clear case for buying it right now."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Because of AI, some established businesses will develop additional sources of revenue, and others will struggle to find a place in the new business and tech environment.', ""Still, other companies, often not thought of as AI stocks, could experience rapid growth and possibly emerge out of nowhere to grow to a market cap of $1 trillion and beyond. Although it's difficult to accurately predict which growth stocks will achieve such a milestone, three Motley Fool contributors have ideas on which of these less obvious AI stocks can grow their market cap beyond $1 trillion."", ""Jake Lerch (Oracle): My pick is Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), thanks to its resurgent cloud business\xa0that's being fueled by skyrocketing demand for artificial intelligence data servers."", 'On the company\'s most recent earnings call (for the three months ending on Feb. 29), Oracle chairman Larry Ellison was very straightforward in admitting that Microsoft\'s explosive cloud growth is driving knock-on success for Microsoft\'s suppliers, including Oracle. ""We\'re building 20 data centers [for] Microsoft and Azure. They just ordered three more data centers this quarter,"" Ellison said.', ""In turn, Oracle's overall revenue rose 7% year over year in its most recent quarter to $13.3 billion. Better yet, management gave upbeat guidance, indicating that future sales goals may be met earlier than expected, as the company's cloud services segment is growing at a 25% year-over-year rate."", ""As for the company's stock, it might be a surprise that Oracle is already America's 20th-largest company with a market cap of $345 billion, making it more than twice the size of iconic companies like Verizon, Caterpillar, and American Express."", ""What is perhaps more shocking, particularly to those of us who lived through the stock's utter collapse in the wake of the dot-com bubble, Oracle has actually been a solid investment for more than a decade. In fact, Oracle's shares have outperformed the S&P 500 over the last decade."", 'So, it might be time for investors to give Oracle another look. Thanks to its red-hot cloud business, this Web 1.0 name could be on the fast track to a $1 trillion market cap. ', ""Justin Pope (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing): Semiconductors have become the building blocks of AI; the chips power the massive computers needed to crunch the data to train AI models. Nvidia, the current king of AI chips with most of the market share, is doing just over $60 billion in companywide sales annually. CEO Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia's rival, believes the AI chip market will grow as large as $400 billion over the coming years."", ""Despite being well-known chip giants, neither Nvidia nor AMD actually manufacture their chips. That job belongs to manufacturing specialists like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). TSMC is the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, with an estimated 56% share of the world's chip production. As the market leader, you can be sure that TSMC is the go-to for these new, highly advanced chips powering the latest innovations like AI."", ""The market isn't exactly sleeping on TSMC stock. After all, the company is worth over $600 billion today. However, it's still reasonably priced at 23 times analysts' estimated 2024 earnings of $6.17 per share."", ""Think about it. If semiconductor demand pushes the AI chip market to such massive growth (several times its current size if Lisa Su is correct), much of that business will trickle down to TSMC. It's not a stretch to see the company's earnings doubling over the next decade, which would be more than enough to push TSMC past a trillion-dollar market cap."", ""The future looks bright for the world's leading chip fab, and a trillion-dollar valuation seems more like a matter of when not if."", 'Will Healy (Airbnb): Most consumers see Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) as a tourism company, and understandably so. It has turned the vacation rental industry on its head, changing any residence into a potential vacation property. Moreover, it has reinforced this reputation by offering activities that might appeal to vacationers.', ""Nonetheless, it would likely surprise many customers and even some investors to know that Airbnb probably owes its success to AI. For one, it's not a first mover in this space. That claim belongs to Expedia's Vrbo. Furthermore, unlike a hotel chain like Hilton, it doesn't own the properties it helps lease."", 'In reality, Airbnb is little more than a website for listings with a high level of name recognition. The company fosters its competitive advantages through AI. The technology helps with challenges such as determining proper pricing levels in a given area or estimating the reputations of prospective tenants.', 'Airbnb has also found unusual applications for AI. The technology plays a role in enforcing holiday activity restrictions and estimating the likelihood a tenant might violate such rules.', 'Also, Airbnb has begun testing its AI chatbot to handle many customer support inquiries. To this end, it recently bought GamePlanner, a company that can presumably make AI experiences on Airbnb seem more human.', 'Moreover, the company might be closer to a $1 trillion market cap than some might assume. Thanks to its 7.7 million listings and 448 million nights and experiences booked in just the fourth quarter of 2023 alone, the stock has already grown to a market cap of $105 billion -- meaning it has to double roughly 3.2 times to take the market cap to $1 trillion.', ""Admittedly, such a feat will likely take a few years since the market cap will still have to grow by almost ninefold to achieve that milestone. Also, Airbnb's P/E ratio of 23 was skewed lower by a one-time income tax benefit, making its true earnings-based valuation higher than it might appear."", ""However, its price-to-sales ratio of 11 is not far from record lows, a factor that should serve as a catalyst as revenue and earnings rise further. With AI continuing to increase the company's productivity, the $1 trillion market cap should eventually be within reach."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

With the pace of change accelerating, investors may wonder when other ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks will join the historic index.', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is now the most valuable company not in the Dow. Even better, Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is a Dow component and would be the most obvious choice for Nvidia to replace.', ""Here's what is preventing Nvidia from joining the Dow and why the growth stock deserves to be a Dow component in the near future."", ""Dow components are usually replaced because they have lost some of their industry leadership or the industry they operate isn't as important to the economy anymore. At a price of just $42 per share, Intel is the second-smallest component of the price-weighted index, ahead of Verizon."", ""Intel stock is doing well, up over 66% in the last year. It is in the same industry as Nvidia, but it isn't a direct competitor. There's some crossover in gaming, PCs, and data centers. But Intel's main growth driver is getting into the foundry business. And Nvidia could even be a customer of Intel's advanced packaging services."", ""Intel doesn't deserve to be replaced. It makes up such a small portion of the Dow that the semiconductor industry is, in many ways, unrepresented. It may be better to swap a different component for Nvidia. But we are getting ahead of ourselves."", 'The first thing Nvidia has to do is split its stock. Amazon could be added only because it split its stock in June 2022. With a price of nearly $900 a share and the median price of a Dow component around $175 a share, Nvidia would have to issue at least a 5-for-1 stock split to avoid tilting the balance of the index.', ""Another issue is timing. There's no schedule for Dow shakeups. But they don't happen too often. Given Amazon just got added, it's unlikely we'll get another swap for at least a couple of years. Alphabet may be first in line for a swap considering its history, market position, and the fact it already split its stock in July 2022."", 'Deciding which component to replace, the stock split ratio, and the timing of the next index restructuring are all relatively minor challenges in the grand scheme of things. The bigger question is whether Nvidia deserves to be a blue-chip Dow stock or if its growth is fleeting.', ""Nvidia is an unrecognizable business from just a few years ago. And it's all because of data centers."", 'Go back to fiscal 2022, and the Graphics segment a far larger segment than Compute and Networking (led by data centers) for Nvidia, generating nearly double the operating income. But in just two years, Compute and Networking performance exploded. In fiscal 2024, Compute and Networking made up 77.8% of total revenue and 84.5% of segment-operating income, with operating income up nearly seven times in that period.', ""Customers are rapidly building AI models and demanding more and more output from Nvidia's chips. However, the semiconductor industry is cyclical. Right now, demand is outpacing supply, driving prices and margin expansion for Nvidia."", ""For Nvidia to sustain its torrid growth rate, AI has to be worth the expense for businesses. In other words, they have to make money on the solutions. For example, if Apple spends a fortune developing an AI assistant for every iPhone and tries to charge a monthly fee that many customers are unwilling to pay, then it's probably not going to accelerate its spending."", ""Microsoft is having breakout success with its AI solutions, like Copilots for Microsoft 365, GitHub AI, Azure AI for cloud infrastructure, and more. It's working now, but the pace of growth could change based on the market, the economy, and customer reception of these solutions."", 'No one knows when it will happen, but Nvidia will eventually enter a downturn, and its growth will slow. At that point, earnings will fall, and the stock will look more expensive -- as is the nature of cyclical industries. The market may be less willing to pay up for Nvidia during that period.', 'Nvidia has the makings of a Dow stock. But the growth of its data center business has happened in a flash.', 'Before Nvidia gets added to the Dow, the market will need to see how this business does during a downturn and mid-cycle conditions. No company is going to get added to the Dow just because its business is hot right now. If that were the case, PayPal could have been added in early 2021 to replace or pair with Visa. Three years ago, PayPal briefly overtook Mastercard in market cap but is worth around seven times less than Mastercard today. Or Zoom Video Communications could have been added in 2020.', ""There are plenty of periods in the stock market where investors get super excited about a theme and drive valuations higher. I don't think AI is a bubble, and I think much of Nvidia's growth is here to stay. But I do expect the pace of growth to slow and want to get a better look at how Nvidia's data center business performs during that slowdown. I suspect the folks in charge of the Dow Jones Industrial Average feel the same."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

First, its broad range of social media apps helps this company appeal to a variety of age groups and interests. Second, switching to a different social media platform takes a decent amount of time and effort -- and Meta's platforms are widely used around the world. These points keep users coming back."", 'This is great because we can count on this revenue driver supporting Meta\'s big AI initiative, one the company is making a priority. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg says this year AI will be the company\'s ""biggest investment area,"" from engineering to compute resources.', ""By the end of this year, Meta aims to have 600,000 graphics processing units (GPUs) on board to power its AI programs. One of Meta's big projects so far has been developing its Llama large language model (LLM) and right now Llama 3 is in the training stage. The company is focused on an open-source process, which allows anyone to access general infrastructure such as the Llama models."", 'This could be a winning bet for Meta because open-sourcing results in greater use of the particular tool, such as Llama, and community feedback -- and that helps make the platform more secure, could lead to it becoming an industry standard, and may drive top talent to Meta.', 'Meta has already rolled out various AI tools across its social media platforms, for example AI stickers and virtual assistant Meta AI, both powered by technology from Llama 2. In the future, Zuckerberg says his goal is for every Meta user to have access to AI tools that suit their needs -- from the AI assistant to AI tools that help businesses better serve customers.', ""These features should encourage Meta users to spend more time on the apps, and this in turn makes these apps the perfect destination for advertisers. So, Meta's investment in AI now should drive revenue growth down the road."", 'All of this could also transform Meta into an AI industry leader, opening the door to new revenue opportunities.', ""Now let's consider Meta's valuation. You have to pay surprisingly little to get in on this stock with a solid growth track record and promising AI prospects -- it's trading for only 25 times forward earnings estimates. That's compared to 37 times for Nvidia."", 'Of course, these companies work differently within the world of AI. Nvidia sells AI chips and other products and services to develop AI platforms -- Meta actually is an Nvidia customer, buying GPUs from this market leader.

', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'One of those shifts is likely to come when the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates.

Because of AI, some established businesses will develop additional sources of revenue, and others will struggle to find a place in the new business and tech environment.', ""Still, other companies, often not thought of as AI stocks, could experience rapid growth and possibly emerge out of nowhere to grow to a market cap of $1 trillion and beyond. Although it's difficult to accurately predict which growth stocks will achieve such a milestone, three Motley Fool contributors have ideas on which of these less obvious AI stocks can grow their market cap beyond $1 trillion."", ""Jake Lerch (Oracle): My pick is Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), thanks to its resurgent cloud business\xa0that's being fueled by skyrocketing demand for artificial intelligence data servers."", 'On the company\'s most recent earnings call (for the three months ending on Feb. 29), Oracle chairman Larry Ellison was very straightforward in admitting that Microsoft\'s explosive cloud growth is driving knock-on success for Microsoft\'s suppliers, including Oracle. ""We\'re building 20 data centers [for] Microsoft and Azure. They just ordered three more data centers this quarter,"" Ellison said.', ""In turn, Oracle's overall revenue rose 7% year over year in its most recent quarter to $13.3 billion. Better yet, management gave upbeat guidance, indicating that future sales goals may be met earlier than expected, as the company's cloud services segment is growing at a 25% year-over-year rate."", ""As for the company's stock, it might be a surprise that Oracle is already America's 20th-largest company with a market cap of $345 billion, making it more than twice the size of iconic companies like Verizon, Caterpillar, and American Express."", ""What is perhaps more shocking, particularly to those of us who lived through the stock's utter collapse in the wake of the dot-com bubble, Oracle has actually been a solid investment for more than a decade. In fact, Oracle's shares have outperformed the S&P 500 over the last decade."", 'So, it might be time for investors to give Oracle another look. Thanks to its red-hot cloud business, this Web 1.0 name could be on the fast track to a $1 trillion market cap.

Nvidia, the current king of AI chips with most of the market share, is doing just over $60 billion in companywide sales annually. CEO Lisa Su of Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia's rival, believes the AI chip market will grow as large as $400 billion over the coming years."", ""Despite being well-known chip giants, neither Nvidia nor AMD actually manufacture their chips. That job belongs to manufacturing specialists like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). TSMC is the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer, with an estimated 56% share of the world's chip production. As the market leader, you can be sure that TSMC is the go-to for these new, highly advanced chips powering the latest innovations like AI."", ""The market isn't exactly sleeping on TSMC stock. After all, the company is worth over $600 billion today. However, it's still reasonably priced at 23 times analysts' estimated 2024 earnings of $6.17 per share."", ""Think about it. If semiconductor demand pushes the AI chip market to such massive growth (several times its current size if Lisa Su is correct), much of that business will trickle down to TSMC. It's not a stretch to see the company's earnings doubling over the next decade, which would be more than enough to push TSMC past a trillion-dollar market cap."", ""The future looks bright for the world's leading chip fab, and a trillion-dollar valuation seems more like a matter of when not if."", 'Will Healy (Airbnb): Most consumers see Airbnb (NASDAQ: ABNB) as a tourism company, and understandably so. It has turned the vacation rental industry on its head, changing any residence into a potential vacation property. Moreover, it has reinforced this reputation by offering activities that might appeal to vacationers.', ""Nonetheless, it would likely surprise many customers and even some investors to know that Airbnb probably owes its success to AI. For one, it's not a first mover in this space. That claim belongs to Expedia's Vrbo. Furthermore, unlike a hotel chain like Hilton, it doesn't own the properties it helps lease."", 'In reality, Airbnb is little more than a website for listings with a high level of name recognition. The company fosters its competitive advantages through AI. The technology helps with challenges such as determining proper pricing levels in a given area or estimating the reputations of prospective tenants.', 'Airbnb has also found unusual applications for AI. The technology plays a role in enforcing holiday activity restrictions and estimating the likelihood a tenant might violate such rules.', 'Also, Airbnb has begun testing its AI chatbot to handle many customer support inquiries. To this end, it recently bought GamePlanner, a company that can presumably make AI experiences on Airbnb seem more human.', 'Moreover, the company might be closer to a $1 trillion market cap than some might assume. Thanks to its 7.7 million listings and 448 million nights and experiences booked in just the fourth quarter of 2023 alone, the stock has already grown to a market cap of $105 billion -- meaning it has to double roughly 3.2 times to take the market cap to $1 trillion.', ""Admittedly, such a feat will likely take a few years since the market cap will still have to grow by almost ninefold to achieve that milestone. Also, Airbnb's P/E ratio of 23 was skewed lower by a one-time income tax benefit, making its true earnings-based valuation higher than it might appear."", ""However, its price-to-sales ratio of 11 is not far from record lows, a factor that should serve as a catalyst as revenue and earnings rise further. With AI continuing to increase the company's productivity, the $1 trillion market cap should eventually be within reach."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Oracle right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Oracle, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Oracle wasn’t one of them.

The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter, with sales, operating margin, and EPS all exceeding our internal expectations. Our traffic trends remained healthy, our brand awareness reached all-time highs, and we drove strong member growth and retention. For the quarter, net sales increased 10.2% to $3.6 billion. Operating profit was 14.5% of sales, and diluted EPS was $8.08 per share. Comparable sales increased 2.5% driven by high single-digit growth from digital channels. Store comp sales increased slightly as we lapped high team growth last year. A thoughtfully curated assortment, engaging marketing strategies, and new fulfillment and technology capabilities enabled our teams to deliver mid-single digit comp growth for the holiday period.', 'Our holiday campaign this year centered around the gift is just the beginning, which underscored our belief in the power of beauty and Ulta Beauty. To support the campaign, we created relevant storytelling which inspired authentic connection, leading to record-breaking impressions, significant growth in shared voice, and strong social engagement. These successful marketing efforts complemented our engaging in-store messaging and events, which focused on bringing beautytainment to guests and building the basket. Compelling content combined with successful promotional strategies drove strong new member acquisition and reactivation while increasing shopping frequency and retention. From a market share perspective, we continue to outpace the growth of the mass market for the 14 weeks ended February 3rd, 2024, according to Circana data.', 'Our market share of prestige Beauty was more challenged as we lapped strong share growth in 2022 and continued to face pressure from the expansion of beauty distribution points in prestige. While competitive intensity has increased, we remain confident our differentiated model and sales driving strategies will support our ability to capture additional market share over the long term. Turning to performance by category. Skincare was our fastest growing category, delivering double-digit comp growth. Brands leading into relevant trends like Bioma, Bubble, and Good Molecules, which is exclusive to Ulta Beauty, delivered strong growth. Dermatologist-recommended brands also continued to appeal to consumers looking for efficacious products from trusted brands, fueling growth for La Roche-Posay, Dermalogica, and Cetaphil.', ""The fragrance and bath category also delivered low double-digit comp growth again this quarter. Nuna's from Valentino, Burberry, and Tree Hut, and holiday gift sets from consumer favorites YSL, Gucci, and Billie Eilish, contributed to strong performance. In addition, in January, we welcomed Sol de Janeiro, a Brazilian-inspired body care brand to the Ulta Beauty family. Available in 700 stores and online, Sol de Janeiro has quickly become a guest favorite, driving growth in the category. Top sales for the makeup category decreased in the low single-digit range. Softness and prestige Cosmetics were partially offset by growth in mass makeup. Lip layering and blush proliferation continued to resonate with beauty enthusiasts, and brands leaning into these trends, including Elf, Nyx, and exclusive brand Juvia's Place, delivered strong growth."", 'While prestige Makeup was challenged in totality as we lacked strong growth last year, luxury brands Dior, Natasha Denona, and Pat McGrath continued to engage guests, and Hourglass Tard and Lancome saw success with compelling holiday offerings. Finally, comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the mid-single digit range, primarily due to a decline in hair tools and the lapping of strong brand launches in 2022. Products focused on styling and foundational routines drove growth for professional brands Redken, Kenra, and Biolage, and interest in hair health and treatments drove increased guest engagement with Way, Mielle, and Divi. Newer brands, including Shark Beauty and Lola Bay also resonated with guests. Our services businesses delivered high single-digit growth for this quarter, driven by an increase in transactions.', 'In addition to core styling services, specialty offerings, including extensions, hair treatments, textures, services, and ear piercing drove strong engagement with guests. Turning now to the full year, net sales for the year increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion, comp sales increased 5.7%, operating profit was 15% of sales, and diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share. In addition to delivering strong financial results, we also made meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. Let me share highlights of advances made this year. Reflecting our efforts to drive growth through all things beauty, we strengthened our assortment with compelling newness and the expansion of strategic cross-category platforms. Using the consumer lens of how guests experience Ulta Beauty through all of our touchpoints, we estimate we maintained our share of the total U.S. beauty product industry.', 'We launched customer favorite brands, including Dior, Beauty Counter, and Sol de Janeiro, and introduced emerging and exclusive brands, including Half Magic and Polite Society. We launched Luxury at Ulta Beauty, a strategically curated luxury beauty experience, and we expanded our cross-category platforms. We ended the year with more than half of our brand portfolio certified in at least one conscious beauty pillar and continued to drive greater awareness and discovery through unique sample kits and greater marketing support. We expanded our Black-owned or founded brands to 50 brands, and welcomed the second cohort of BIPOC brands to our Muse Accelerator program, a program designed to help early-stage BIPOC brands prepare for retail readiness.', 'Additionally, we expanded the wellness shop to nearly all stores and refreshed the presentation to inspire and educate guests how to integrate wellness into their everyday lives. Turning to our second strategic pillar, All In Your World, we improved the guest experience across all of our touchpoints. We enhanced our physical footprint, opening 33 new stores and renovating or relocating 25 stores. Our services business delivered double-digit comp growth for the year, increasing frequency with members who already engaged in services while also introducing new members to our offering. And we drove greater experiential shopping through more in-store events focused on engaging and educating the guests about new products, new techniques, and the latest beauty trends.', 'We also delivered significant improvements in our digital store experience. We successfully transitioned key guest-facing and commerce elements to a new, modern architecture, delivering a fresh guest experience across both ulta.com and our app, and providing our teams with new tools to optimize the guest experience. These enhancements, combined with our efforts to drive omnichannel member penetration, resulted in high single-digit growth in ecommerce sales and a 30% increase in member utilization of our app. To support stronger omnichannel experiences, we continue to improve our buy anywhere, fill anywhere capabilities. We expanded same day delivery to all stores and increased our ship from store capabilities to 450 stores. Between focus, same day delivery and ship from store, 37% of our digital orders this year were fulfilled by stores, up from 31% last year.', 'Finally, we strengthened our partnership with Target with the introduction of new brands and the opening of 155 additional Ulta Beauty at Target locations ending the year with 510 shops. And we deepened guest engagement as reflected in growth of new member conversions, re-engagement of lapsed guests and greater loyalty account linkage, as well as increased bounce back to Ulta Beauty stores. Moving to our third strategic pillar, expanding and deepening guest engagement and loyalty by operating at the heart of the beauty community. Our marketing strategies, media investments and brand building efforts resulted in record level, unaided awareness, brand love and loyalty. To drive awareness and spark deeper connection engagement, we launched the Joy Project, a multiyear brand equity initiative to make beauty and the world a more joyful place.', 'We expanded our social media engagement across multiple platforms with new trend setting series and compelling content, which drove strong engagement, positive social sentiment and share of voice. And we achieved an important milestone. In December, we surpassed 1 million followers on TikTok, reinforcing our position as a social brand leader in beauty. With improved member retention, strong new member acquisition and healthy reactivation of lapsed members, we expanded our loyalty program by 8%, ending the year with 43.3 million loyalty members who shopped more frequently and spent more with us on average. Leading into the power of our best-in-class loyalty program in January, we rebranded the program to Ulta Beauty Rewards, featuring a stronger birthday experience and a refreshed look in stores and online and across social to drive greater awareness and deepen connection with our members.', 'We are excited to reward our members with even more of what they love and showcase how much we appreciate them. Finally, UB Media, our retail media network, continued to deliver value. This year, we expanded the team, introduced new on-site products and launched an innovative omnichannel solution which supports the measurement of campaigns across both digital and physical stores. Our fourth strategic pillar is to drive operational excellence and optimization to enable us to capture additional market share, fund guest experience enhancements, and deliver future profitable growth. I am very proud of what our teams accomplished in fiscal 2023, which was an ambitious year of foundational transformation for Ulta Beauty. We completed the retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center, began the retrofit of our Dallas distribution Center, opened our Greer Market Fulfillment Center and began work on our Bolingbrook Market Fulfillment Center.', 'We successfully transitioned our Jacksonville Greers and Chambersburg distribution facilities and key merchandising processes to our new enterprise resource planning platform, and we converted key merchandising and commerce elements of our digital store to a new architecture while maintaining digital operations. We built a New Enterprise Data Platform on Google Cloud Infrastructure, establishing a modern ecosystem for future analytics and data-driven decision capabilities, and we completed our rollout of new POS systems, including mobile checkout in all stores. Our teams enable our success and we continue to invest and protect and cultivate our world-class culture and talent. This year we introduced a new leadership competency model, redesigned our succession planning and talent review processes, expanded our associate development offering and completed enterprise-wide training to reinforce inclusivity and address unconscious bias.', ""Associate retention improved across stores, distribution centers, and our corporate team. And our 2023 culture survey results reinforced that our overall associate engagement remains strong. Finally, we made progress against our sixth strategic pillar to expand our environmental and social impact. We continue to improve the energy efficiency of stores through LED lighting retrofits, HVAC retrofit, and energy management system upgrades and established 2030 emissions reduction goals approved by the science-based target initiative. I am incredibly proud of what our teams accomplished in 2023. Our teams worked through unexpected challenges with agility and grace and I'm grateful for their steadfast commitment to deliver value for all stakeholders, while also enabling new capabilities for future growth."", 'As we look forward, we remain optimistic about the strength and resiliency of the beauty category. Over the last three years, the beauty category has experienced unprecedented growth, in 2024 we expect the category will remain healthy, but the growth will moderate to the mid-single digit range, barring a major economic event. Beauty is an attractive category, and competitive intensity continues to increase as channels blur and distribution expands. To protect and expand our leadership position, this year we expect to advance our transformational agenda with the completion of key projects, while also investing in core traffic and experience drivers to strengthen engagement and enhance the guest experience. Starting with our go-to-market strategic pillars, we will innovate, evolve, and expand all things beauty to excite and engage the beauty enthusiast.', ""To strengthen our differentiated position, we'll continue to expand our assortment with compelling and relevant brand launches like Sol de Janeiro and Charlotte Tilbury, while also building exclusive emerging brands in our pipeline yet to be announced. In addition, this year we will refresh Ulta Beauty Collection and position the brand as the cornerstone of our Conscious Beauty platform and we will continue to enhance and amplify luxury at Ulta Beauty and across category platforms. Reflecting the importance of omnichannel engagement, we will invest in the guest experience across all of our touchpoints. We will further expand and enhance our physical footprint through additional new stores, remodels, and relocations. In all stores, we will focus on enhancing the guest experience through friendly and helpful associates, fast and frictionless fulfillment, and engaging services and events, while also improving operational excellence through simplification, prioritization, and optimizing our store teams."", 'We also plan to drive growth across digital platforms as we leverage new capabilities to amplify brand launches and events, drive greater digital discovery and conversion, and expand personalization across our digital platforms. And we will expand and enhance our partnership with Target as we support new Ulta Beauty and Target shops, evolve the assortment, and deepen member engagement through targeted loyalty strategies. Operating at the heart of the beauty community, we intend to expand and deepen guest loyalty and engagement. To support long-term brand equity and drive deeper emotional connection with consumers, we will amplify the JOY project with a continuous rhythm of engaging activations and drive community through an expanded creator network and affiliate program.', 'We will support brand activations and events to drive new member acquisition, while also leveraging our unique data insights to expand our targeting and member engagement. We will evolve our strategic promotional events to inspire and engage our beauty community, drive trips and encourage omnichannel engagement, and we plan to expand the impact and value of UB Media. Turning now to our operational excellence and optimization efforts, in fiscal 2024, we plan to complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda, including project SOAR, digital store, and the upgrade of our data management capabilities. We also plan to invest in a new martech stack to support our personalization, retail media, and overall ecommerce efforts.', 'Our supply chain optimization journey will continue. As our Bolingbroke Market Fulfillment Center is completed, we continue to retrofit our Dallas Distribution Center, and we begin the retrofit of our remaining full service DCs in Chambersburg and Fresno. In addition, we intend to leverage our established continuous improvement capabilities to drive additional cost efficiencies with a priority on improving processes to reduce shrink. To protect our culture and cultivate our talent while also enabling future business performance, we will continue to invest in our associates and team. We intend to focus on enrichments to the frontline associate experience, enhance associate learning and development and deepen our DEI impact. Turning to our final strategic pillar, we intend to stay focused on our environmental and social impact.', 'Building on progress made in 2023, we plan to implement our roadmap to achieve our emission reduction goals. Finally, I want to share an update on how we are approaching expansion opportunities outside the US. International expansion represents an incremental long-term opportunity for Ulta Beauty to extend our reach and leverage our differentiated value proposition. Today, we are excited to announce our planned market entry into Mexico. The Mexican beauty market is sizable, growing, and has significant beauty opportunity. Our research suggests there is a healthy awareness of the Ulta Beauty brand with local beauty enthusiasts and we also see strong engagement in stores located in geographically adjacent markets. After extensive evaluation, we prioritized an asset light partnership approach to enable us to move quickly.', ""And I am excited to announce we have formed a joint venture with Axo, a highly experienced operator of global brands to launch and operate Ulta Beauty in Mexico in 2025. As a result of this partnership approach, we do not expect this venture to be material to our financials in fiscal 2024. For competitive reasons, we're not sharing more details today, but we'll provide updates as appropriate. In closing, the Ulta Beauty team delivered strong financial performance in fiscal 2023, while also achieving meaningful progress against our strategic priorities. As we look to 2024, I remain excited about the opportunity to enhance our market leadership and drive profitable growth. We operate in a growing category with strong consumer engagement, and I am confident that our proven differentiated business model, strategic priorities, and outstanding, passionate team will enable us to move beauty forward in ways that create values for our shareholders and have a positive impact on our guests, associates, and the communities we serve."", ""Now, as many of you know, this will be Scott's last earnings call, and I want to recognize and thank Scott for his many contributions to Ulta Beauty. He has been an exceptional partner to me and an inspirational leader for our entire team. Now, today, you will also hear from Paula Oyibo, who will become our CFO on April 1st. Paula joined Ulta Beauty in 2019 and is a dynamic finance executive with broad industry experience. She understands our business and our guests, and I know she will have a strong impact on our business going forward. And now, I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of our financial results. Scott?"", 'Scott Settersten : Thanks Dave and good afternoon, everyone. I will review our fourth quarter financial results before turning it over to Paula Oyibo who will walk through the outlook for fiscal 2024. Financial results for the fourth quarter came in ahead of our expectations across the top and bottom line reflecting strong holiday performance, growth in other revenue and healthy traffic trends as well as strong execution and focused expense management. Net sales for the quarter increased 10.2% driven by 2.5% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance, a $25 million increase in other revenue as well as the impact of the 53rd week in fiscal 2023. Net sales for the 53rd week were $181.9 million. The growth in comp sales was driven by a 4.5% increase in transactions.', 'Average ticket declined 1.9% driven by lower units per transaction which were partially offset by higher average selling price. Reflecting a more normalized pricing environment we estimate that product price increases contributed about 100 basis points to the overall increase. Looking at the cadence of sales through the quarter, comp sales were solid in November and December reflecting strong holiday performance. As expected, sales were more challenged in January as we lapped the exceptional results from our strongest month in fiscal 2022. During the quarter, we opened 13 new stores, relocated two, remodeled two stores and closed two stores. For the quarter gross margin increased 10 basis points to 37.7% of sales. The increase was driven by strong growth in other revenue, lower shipping rates and leverage of supply chain costs which were largely offset by lower merchandise margin.', 'Our efforts to grow other revenue continue to yield benefits with performance driven by increased credit card income, greater loyalty point redemptions, and royalties earned through our Target partnership. At the same time, we realize benefits from our supply chain optimization efforts as our carrier diversification strategy drove improved profitability. As anticipated, merchandise margin was pressured during the quarter, reflecting the lapping of benefits from price increases, increased promotionality, as well as the impact from brand mix. These pressures were partially offset by ongoing category management efforts. The impact of promotional activity was above last year, but continues to be well below 2019 levels. Notably, shrink was flat during the quarter, slightly better than our expectations, reflecting the impact of our investments this year in training, labor, and new fragrance fixtures.', ""For the full year, shrink as a percentage of sales increased 40 basis points. Moving to expenses, SG&A increased 7.6% to $820 million. Overall SG&A spend was better than planned due to focused expense management and a shift in timing of certain strategic investments. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased 50 basis points to 23.1% compared to 23.6% last year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation and leverage of marketing expenses in store payroll and benefits, which was partially offset by deleverage of corporate overhead and store expenses. Incentive compensation drove 40 basis points of leverage in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that was more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance."", 'In addition to the impact of higher sales, marketing expense leverage was driven by the timing of advertising expenses, while store payroll and benefits leverage reflected fewer payroll hours per store, which more than offset ongoing wage rate pressures. Offsetting these benefits, corporate overhead expense deleverages during the quarter, primarily reflecting investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, Digital Store and other IT capabilities, and UB Media. For the full year, we invested $62 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives, which was at the lower end of our expectations, reflecting the shift in timing of certain projects into 2024. Finally, store expenses also deleveraged, driven by investments to support merchandising initiatives, as well as ongoing inflationary pressures across the business.', ""Operating margin was 14.5% of sales compared to 13.9% last year. The company's tax rate decreased to 24.2% compared to 24.6% in the fourth quarter last year. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to benefits from a decrease in state income taxes. Diluted GAAP earnings per share increased 21% to $8.08 compared to $6.68 last year. The EPS impact of the 53rd week was $0.46. To recap the full year, net sales increased 9.8% to $11.2 billion. Comp sales increased 5.7% driven by a 7.4% increase in transactions and a 1.5% decrease in average ticket. We estimate that product price increases contributed about 200 basis points to the overall comp increase for the year. Operating profit was 15% of sales with deleverage coming evenly from gross margin and SG&A and diluted EPS increased 8.4% to a record $26.03 per share."", 'Moving on to the balance sheet and cash flow statement. Total inventory increased 8.6% to $1.7 billion compared to $1.6 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 30 net new stores, the increase reflects inventory to support new brand launches, the new market fulfillment center in Greer, South Carolina, as well as the impact of product cost increases. Our well-established business model continues to generate significant cash from operations, including nearly $1.5 billion in fiscal 2023. Our capital allocation approach remains consistent. Our first priority is to reinvest in our business to drive future growth followed by returning excess cash to our shareholders. In fiscal 2023, we invested $435 million in capital expenditures, including approximately $178 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, $124 million for IT, $73 million for supply chain, and $60 million for store maintenance and other.', ""Depreciation for the year was $244 million compared to $241 million last year and primarily reflects the ongoing shift of IT investments from capital to cloud expense. During the fourth quarter, we repurchased 352, 000 shares at a cost of $159 million, bringing total share repurchase to $1 billion for the full year. Since launching our stock buyback program in 2014, we've purchased more than 18 million shares at a weighted average price of $313, effectively returning $5.8 billion to shareholders while continuing to invest in strategic growth drivers. Before I turn the call over to Paula, I want to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude to our teams for delivering these strong results for our shareholders this year and throughout my tenure with Ulta Beauty."", ""It has been an honor to serve as the company's CFO and a privilege to lead and serve alongside such talented associates. I'm excited to pass the baton to Paula, who I know will be an excellent leader and steward of Ulta Beauty's business going forward."", ""Paula Oyibo : Thank you, Scott. I am honored and humbled to be assuming the position of Chief Financial Officer at Ulta Beauty and I am excited to lead our talented finance organization and to drive Ulta Beauty's next phase of growth. I want to thank Scott for his mentorship over the years and wish him all the best in his well-deserved retirement. I look forward to working with those on the call today and meeting those of you I have not yet met. Before we talk about our expectations for fiscal 2024, I want to share two capital allocation updates. First, yesterday we amended our revolver agreement to $800 million and extended the term to 2029. Reflecting the current rate environment, we reduced the size of the revolver to lower the impact of higher fees but retained flexibility to upsize the capacity, if needed."", 'Second, having essentially completed the authorization announced in March 2022, today we announced a new share repurchase authorization for $2 billion. Now turning to our outlook for fiscal 2024, we expect net sales will be in the range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion with comp sales growth expected to be between 4% and 5%. We anticipate comp growth will be in the low single-digit range in the first half and then increase to mid-single digit growth in the second half of the year. We expect operating margin will be between 14% and 14.3% of sales, primarily driven by SG&A deleverage as we complete many of the foundational elements of our transformational agenda and move to investments to enable growth, operationalize the investments made in 2023, manage ongoing wage pressures, and support core traffic and experienced drivers.', 'In total, we expect SG&A growth for the year will moderate into the high single digit range from 12.5% growth in fiscal 2023. We expect SG&A growth in the first half will be in the low double-digit range as we annualize investment spend in 2023 and complete key milestones of our transformational agenda and then slow to mid-single digit growth in the second half. We expect gross margin for the year will be down modestly as lower merchandise margin and deleverage of supply chain costs are partially offset by other revenue. Our assumptions result in a diluted earnings guidance in the range of $26.20 to $27 per share. We are planning EPS to decline in the first half and then accelerate to high single digit growth in the second half of the year.', 'For modeling purposes, we expect operating margin to be the most challenged in the first quarter with meaningful deleverage across SG&A and gross margin. Finally, we plan to spend between $415 million and $490 million in CapEx, including approximately $270 million to $282 million for new stores, remodels, and merchandise fixtures, $120 million to $155 million for supply chain and IT, and $45 million to $53 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be between $275 million and $280 million. We believe the outlook for the beauty category is bright and we are confident our strategic framework and strong financial foundation will enable us to drive long-term growth and shareholder returns. Before we take your questions, I want to announce that we plan to host an investor event here in Chicago this fall to share our longer-term plans and outlook.', ""We will share more of the logistical details later this summer. And now, I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A."", 'See also 6 Cheaper Alternatives to Braces for Kids and Adults and 10 Alternatives to Antidepressant Medications.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

It's easy to get caught up in analyzing stocks so much that people put off buying them.

Here's why they chose Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY), Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO), and Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX)."", ""Prosper Junior Bakiny (Eli Lilly): No company is completely insulated from obstacles. High-flying Eli Lilly is no exception. Though the drugmaker has delivered market-shattering returns in recent years, it has encountered some regulatory headwinds. Last week, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced it would delayapproval of Eli Lilly's donanemab, a therapy for Alzheimer's disease."", ""The health regulatory agency will also convene a panel of experts to discuss the clinical trial Eli Lilly used to support donanemab's application, a potential sign of ambiguity in the data. The pharmaceutical giant's shares fell on the news, which I think was a misguided reaction. Even without approval of donanemab, Eli Lilly's lineup is exceptional."", ""The company boasts what could become the best-selling clinical compound in the history of the industry in tirzepatide, marketed as Zepbound, in the weight-loss market. Eli Lilly's new cancer medicine Jaypirca could hit annual sales of $3 billion by 2032, while ulcerative colitis medicine Omvoh -- also a new addition to the lineup -- could cross the billion-dollar mark in annual sales by 2029."", ""That hardly tells the whole story. Eli Lilly's lineup and pipeline look highly promising. The company's important approvals in recent years haven't been flukes. While adding donanemab would be a boost, Eli Lilly's prospects remain excellent even if the FDA gives it the thumbs down."", ""The company has been unstoppable in the past decade, with returns that aren't common among drugmakers its size. One or two regulatory setbacks don't change the company's prospects. Don't sweat the small stuff. Eli Lilly remains a no-brainer stock to buy right now."", 'David Jagielski (Novo Nordisk): Novo Nordisk ranks as one of the most valuable healthcare companies in the world with its market cap close to $600 billion. Unlike many companies vying to get weight-loss products to market, Novo Nordisk already has a solid reputation in not just weight loss but diabetes as well.', 'Its business centers around those treatments. And between Ozempic for diabetes and Wegovy for weight loss, it has some exciting assets to build its future around. Last week, investors got even more of a reason to remain bullish on the stock. The FDA granted approval for a new indication for Wegovy to reduce the risk of cardiovascular risk in adults who are obese or overweight.', 'This is a big win for Novo Nordisk as it accomplishes two things in the process. It gives doctors another reason to prescribe Wegovy and potentially gives health insurers more of a reason to provide coverage now that Wegovy is more than just a weight-loss treatment.', 'In 2023, Novo Nordisk generated net sales totaling 232.3 billion Danish kroner ($34.8 billion) as its top line rose by 36% when factoring out the impact of foreign currency. And its bottom line rose by 51% to 83.7 billion Danish kroner ($12.6 billion).', ""While Ozempic's sales rose at a rate of 66% last year at constant exchange rates, Wegovy's growth rate was even higher at 420%. These high-powered products still have a lot more room to grow and deliver more revenue for Novo Nordisk in the future. And with Wegovy obtaining a new indication, the future just keeps getting brighter for the company."", ""It may seem like an expensive stock to own since it's trading at nearly 50 times earnings. But with so much growth on the horizon, Novo Nordisk is still a top growth stock to buy right now."", 'Keith Speights (Vertex Pharmaceuticals): Why do investors sometimes hesitate to buy stocks?

No other company has an approved product that treats the underlying cause of the rare genetic disease.

The company hopes to file for regulatory approval of its vanzacaftor triple-drug combo this summer. If approved (which seems likely), this newest CF therapy could be Vertex's most profitable yet."", 'The company has already expanded beyond CF with Casgevy winning approvals in treating two rare blood disorders, sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia. Casgevy should reach peak annual sales measured in the billions of dollars.', ""Another non-CF therapy could soon be on the market. Vertex plans to submit regulatory filings for VX-548 by mid-2024. The pain drug should have tremendous commercial potential because it doesn't have the addictive potential and negative side effects of opioids."", 'We might not have to wait just a few years more for Vertex to crack open a brand-new massive market. The company is evaluating inaxaplin in late-stage clinical testing targeting APOL1-mediated kidney disease (AMKD). This illness affects more patients globally than CF -- and there are no approved therapies for treating its underlying cause.', ""As for valuation concerns, Vertex's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is only 0.6. Any PEG ratio significantly below 1 is a bargain. Granted, Vertex must hit analysts' growth projections.

Shares of the electric vehicle (EV) maker are down around 30% this year as price cuts for its vehicles have resulted in lower margins for the business, and concerns about rising competition have investors doubting whether the premium the stock was trading at was truly warranted.', 'It can be a risky time to invest in Tesla given all the uncertainties of the EV market, especially as more competitors enter the field. Even now, at close to 60 times its expected future earnings, it may still not look cheap.', 'Instead of trying to catch a falling knife in Tesla, investors may be better off buying shares of a lesser-known company, but with a more promising growth trajectory: Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX).', ""Vertex Pharmaceuticals is an exciting healthcare company to invest in. The company has grown its revenue from $6.2 billion in 2020 to just under $9.9 billion this past year. And what's more impressive is that amid that growth, it has been able to maintain a very healthy profit margin. In 2023, its net income totaled $3.6 billion, which was 37% of its top line."", ""The company's revenue centers around its cystic fibrosis (CF) products, in particular, the Trikafta/Kaftrio brand, which brought in $8.9 billion in revenue last year. CF revenue has been slowing down, but that doesn't mean Vertex's growth opportunities are diminishing. In fact, the company may be on the cusp of even more growth in the future."", 'The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved a gene therapy Vertex has been developing with CRISPR Therapeutics, Casgevy, as a treatment for sickle cell disease and transfusion-dependent beta thalassemia. At its peak, it could generate more than $2 billion in sales. ', ""Another growth catalyst involves Vertex's non-opioid pain medication, VX-548. The company plans to file for the treatment's approval later this year. At its peak, this could be another blockbuster drug for Vertex, with peak annual sales potentially as high as $5 billion. "", 'With such magnificent potential ahead, Vertex could be due to rise higher. And its modest valuation may sweeten the deal for growth investors today.', ""Despite the encouraging outlook for Vertex's future and the recent approval of Casgevy, shares of the healthcare company are up less than 2% this year. As investors seem to have been focused on artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, many may have been looking past a fantastic stock in Vertex."", ""But that's good news if you're planning to buy it today. Given the opportunities the business possesses over the long run, the market doesn't seem to value Vertex that high.

For most investors, it made more sense to collect those risk-free interest payments instead of dividends.', 'But this year most analysts expect interest rates to stabilize or decline as inflation cools off. The ongoing rally in higher-growth tech stocks could also abruptly end as those popular companies struggle to maintain their rising valuations. Those factors could easily drive investors back toward higher-yielding dividend stocks over the next few quarters.', 'When investors look at dividend stocks, they should seek out companies with stable earnings growth, reasonable payout ratios, track records of dividend hikes, and low valuations. I believe these three safe stocks make the cut: Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), General Mills (NYSE: GIS), and HP (NYSE: HPQ).', ""Coca-Cola is the world's largest soda maker, but it's broadly diversified its portfolio by acquiring more brands of fruit juices, teas, bottled water, sports drinks, energy drinks, coffee, and even alcoholic beverages over the past few decades. It also refreshed its carbonated drinks with new flavors, smaller serving sizes, and healthier versions."", 'That expansion and evolution enabled Coca-Cola to continue growing even as soda consumption rates declined worldwide.

The company is grappling with a near-term slowdown as it deals with softer consumer spending, inflationary headwinds, and supply chain issues, but it should eventually recover, and its stock looks cheap at just 14 times forward earnings. It froze its dividend in 2018 to cope with its acquisition of Blue Buffalo, but it started raising its payout annually again in 2021. It spent 57% of its FCF on dividends over the past 12 months, and it pays an attractive forward yield of 3.6%.', 'HP is one of the largest producers of PCs and printers in the world. It sold more PCs and home printers throughout the pandemic as more people worked from home, but it suffered a slowdown after those stay-at-home tailwinds dissipated.', ""The macroeconomic headwinds exacerbated that pressure as companies reined in their spending on new office equipment. As a result, HP's revenue and adjusted EPS declined 15% and 18%, respectively, in fiscal 2023 (which ended last October).

As well, the company has been making critical investments in digital intelligence. So, you can’t fault NVDA stock for rising above fears, doubts and looks of incredulity. The underlying enterprise is simply better than the rest.', 'Nevertheless, it probably wouldn’t be the most prudent idea to bet everything on Nvidia.

Instead, Big Blue has focused on imbuing practical capabilities with its systems and platforms. Stated differently, it performs many of the actions that the top-tier AI companies do but at a lower valuation.', 'For example, IBM trades at only 19.08X forward earnings.

However, I believe Intuit is one of the enterprises that could truly make a meaningful contribution regarding digital intelligence and its practical applicability. Basically, taxes are complicated. Therefore, Intuit has the ability to generate a 24/7/365 tax accountant. The implications are massive.', 'After all, a key benefit of generative AI is the ability to ask anything. Maybe the chatbot won’t answer but you can still ask whatever you want. That’s different from human interactions, which because of social mechanisms, certain important questions may not be asked out of embarrassment or what-have-you.', 'Notably, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy and I’m not surprised at all. Looking ahead, Intuit could be one of the most important underappreciated AI stocks to buy. Admittedly, its $705.62 average price target is relatively modest. However, the high-side target lands at $775.', 'In fairness, INTU isn’t particularly undervalued on paper. However, as a steady stalwart, it deserves another look.', 'Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com', 'If we’re talking about underappreciated AI stocks to buy, we’ve got to mention CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD). A cybersecurity technology firm, CrowdStrike is already relevant thanks to its cloud workload and endpoint security, threat intelligence and cyberattack response services. As we’ve seen in recent years, cyberattacks continue to dampen meteoric innovations in the tech ecosystem.', 'Moreover, it’s quite possible that AI could foster a new wave of nefarious online activities. Basically, cybercriminals can use AI to easily (and quickly) create new malware. What’s worse, these threats may use protocols that help them bypass detection. Therefore, it’s imperative that companies like CrowdStrike get ahead of this problem.', 'Right now, analysts peg CRWD as a consensus strong buy. That’s probably one of the easiest assessments you’ll see. Further, the average price target lands at $381.38, with the high side soaring to $435. Again, that’s not shocking.', 'By the end of this fiscal year, the Street’s experts see revenue coming in at $3.94 billion. If so, we’re talking about a 29% lift from last year’s sales. CRWD is easily one of the underappreciated AI stocks to buy.', 'Source: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com', 'When it comes to digital intelligence, it’s no shocker to see Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) as one of the underappreciated AI stocks to buy. That’s not to impugn the company and its massive Google ecosystem. Clearly, it knows a thing or two about tech. However, its Bard chatbot – now renamed Gemini – tends to take a backseat to ChatGPT.', 'Nevertheless, as I argued in a TipRanks article, Alphabet may have the long-term edge. Here’s the reality: both Gemini and ChatGPT make plenty of mistakes. They also can be incredibly draining and frustrating errors. Given this reality, ChatGPT’s first-mover advantage doesn’t mean much other than symbolism. When it comes to the nuts and bolts, they’re both roughly on the same footing.', 'However, Gemini could rise higher in the long run thanks to Google effectively owning the internet. If Gemini could somehow be integrated with a self-correcting protocol – that is, it looks up answers on Google before giving them – it could end up being exponentially more useful than ChatGPT.', 'Still, one would need to exercise considerable patience for this narrative to pan out. While you’re waiting, you can potentially grab a robust reward over the next 12 months from this “strong buy” stock.', 'Source: r.classen / Shutterstock.com', 'If you look at my work output for InvestorPlace and other platforms, you’ll see that I don’t have too much free time. So, I missed much of the earlier enthusiasm surrounding Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) and its generative AI solutions. After taking another look, I’m impressed at the modulation opportunities available because of digital intelligence. Not only that, productivity should accelerate tremendously.', 'However, the market appears to be digesting ADBE’s robust return from last year. Admittedly, the price action seems questionable. It’s definitely a higher-risk opportunity among underappreciated AI stocks to buy. That said, analysts anticipate revenue of $21.46 billion for the current fiscal year. If so, we’re talking a revenue growth rate of 20%.', 'Even better, 2025 sales are projected to land at just under $24 billion. That would be almost 12% up from 2024’s projected revenue. Earnings should also soar to $17.94 and $20.31 per share, respectively, in this year and next.', 'Lastly, analysts peg shares as a consensus moderate buy with a $649.52 average price target. Further, the high-side target reaches a lofty $705.', 'Among the most underappreciated AI stocks to buy, Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) makes the most sense; that is, it’s easy to figure out why investors have been skeptical about BIDU stock. Sure, from the doldrums of 2020 to early 2021, BIDU went parabolic. However, the subsequent crash stemmed largely from concerns about China’s economy. As you can see from the year-to-date performance, it’s still a matter of concern.', 'However, investors may want to give Baidu another look. For one thing, the company is undervalued now. At the midway point last year, BIDU stock traded hands at 14.47X forward earnings. Right now, this metric sits at 9.51X. Second, analysts anticipate solid growth for this year, with sales possibly reaching $20.16 billion. The high-side estimate aims for just under $21 billion.', 'By 2025, experts anticipate sales to reach $21.63 billion on average and $23.19 billion at the high end. These aren’t unrealistic expectations given Baidu’s investments and substantive progress in AI.', 'Finally, Wall Street rates shares as a unanimous strong buy with a $164.52 average price target.

As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. In this article, we decided to focus on Stryker's  ROE."", ""Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity."", ' See our latest analysis for Stryker ', 'The formula for ROE is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Stryker is:', '17% = US$3.2b ÷ US$19b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.17 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""To start with, Stryker's ROE looks acceptable. On comparing with the average industry ROE of 11% the company's ROE looks pretty remarkable. Needless to say, we are quite surprised to see that Stryker's net income shrunk at a rate of 3.8% over the past five years. Therefore, there might be some other aspects that could explain this. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures."", ""However, when we compared Stryker's growth with the industry we found that while the company's earnings have been shrinking, the industry has seen an earnings growth of 14% in the same period. This is quite worrisome."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is SYK fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", ""In spite of a normal three-year median payout ratio of 45% (that is, a retention ratio of 55%), the fact that Stryker's earnings have shrunk is quite puzzling. So there might be other factors at play here which could potentially be hampering growth. For example, the business has faced some headwinds."", ""Moreover, Stryker has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 25% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 21% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio."", ""In total, it does look like Stryker has some positive aspects to its business. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

It’s the essence that captures our senses, igniting emotions and inspiring admiration.', 'The skincare, fragrance, makeup, and haircare sectors of the booming global beauty business all contribute significantly to the global economy.\xa0 The beauty sector proved resilient even in times of global economic crisis, bringing in around $430 billion in revenue in 2022. McKinsey & Company reports that the beauty industry is expected to expand at an anticipated pace of 6% per year and reach around $580 billion in revenue by 2027. This rise is comparable to, or marginally greater than, that of other consumer segments, such as clothing, accessories, footwear, pet supplies, and food and beverages.\xa0', 'Premiumization, or customers trading up and paying more, particularly on makeup and fragrances, is what defines the beauty sector. The emergence of independent brands and new competitors has increased competition in the market, compelling established names and merchants to evolve.\xa0 The steady growth of the beauty industry is mostly due to e-commerce, with online sales almost tripling between 2015 and 2022 and accounting for over 20% of total sales. To satisfy the demands of a dynamic and competitive market, the coming years will be characterized by innovation, shifting consumer preferences, and an emphasis on omnichannel purchasing experiences.\xa0', 'According to estimates from the US Census and the Simmons National Consumer Survey, the average American spends $322.88 a year on skincare or almost $15,000 throughout their lifetime.', ""In another instance, when American women were surveyed, 78% of them said they spent an hour a day taking care of their appearance (makeup, hair treatments, and outfits). Looks-related activities were found to require less time investment than hair and cosmetics, which take up an average of 55 minutes in a woman's day.\xa0\xa0"", 'Consumer tastes and company strategies are being shaped by a variety of popular trends that the beauty industry is observing in 2024. Trends like ""skin streaming,"" which emphasizes minimizing skincare procedures, and ""butterfly bob"" haircuts are becoming increasingly popular in all areas of skincare, hair, and makeup. The financial and business aspects of these trends are visible in the rise of environmentally friendly skincare products and the spread of beauty businesses into retail. The line of eco-friendly skincare products from Plaine Products is one of the most recent releases. Plaine Products is committed to reducing plastic pollution by offering zero-waste, environmentally friendly skincare products.\xa0', ""Customers are increasingly choosing contactless payments—58% of them prefer this method, according to the Amex Survey—demonstrating the industry's shift toward more practical and effective payment solutions. These patterns not only show how customer needs are changing, but they also give companies a chance to modify their approaches to stay competitive in the beauty industry in 2024."", 'In response to the increasing consumer desire for sustainable, natural, and organic products, the beauty industry is changing quickly.

Beauty aims to increase its retail skincare sales share to roughly 18%, giving it a stronger position in the market. In 2023, e.l.f. Beauty, Inc.

Horton. However, its position didn't last long, and in the fourth quarter, Berkshire closed out its stake in D.R. Horton. Should investors follow Buffett's lead, or is D.R. Horton a good stock for the long haul? Let's dive in and find out."", 'D.R. Horton is the largest home builder in the U.S. in total volume. In its four-decade history, the company has closed more than 1 million homes and has been the largest homebuilder in the U.S. since 2002. The company primarily constructs and sells single-family homes across 118 markets in 33 states, with Texas and Florida being some of its largest markets.', 'The company primarily makes money building and selling single-family homes but also constructs townhouses and duplexes, and operates a rental segment where it constructs singe and multifamily properties, and sells them in bulk.', 'When investing in homebuilders, investors should be aware of the cyclical nature of the business. Cyclical stocks tend to follow alongside the cycle of economic expansion and recession, performing very well during expansion and suffering more during economic pullbacks. Homebuilders tend to rise alongside real estate prices, which can be an ongoing source of growth because home values (almost always) appreciate in the long run, although challenging periods like those in 2008 can weigh heavily on the company.', 'Despite the cyclicality of the homebuilding industry, D.R. Horton has been a stellar long-term performer. Over the past two decades, including the housing market crash of 2008, the stock has delivered investors a solid 10% annualized return. Long-term trends such as growing populations in the U.S. and rising real estate values are strong, long-term tailwinds for homebuilders like D.R. Horton.', 'DHI Total Return Level data by YCharts.', 'Last year, D.R. Horton earned $35.5 billion in total revenue as robust demand for homes during its fiscal year (ending Sept. 30, 2023) increased net-sales orders by 3%.', 'Inflationary pressures and high mortgage-interest rates weighed on its business early in the fiscal year. However, demand improved in the second quarter of last year thanks to seasonal factors, along with incentives and pricing adjustments by D.R. Horton to adapt to changing market conditions. This helped boost sales but resulted in lower margins and its net income fell 19% year over year.', 'In Q1 (ending Dec. 31, 2023), D.R. Horton saw its number of closed homes increase by 12%, home sales increase by 8%, and revenue increase by 6%. Although it had a solid quarter, its operating margins and net income fell slightly as it continued offering incentives and adjustments.', 'Multiple factors could impact homebuilders in the near term. For example, higher interest rates have caused the value of homes to drop. According to data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank, the median sales price of houses in the U.S. was $417,700 in Q4, down from its peak price of $479,500 just one year earlier. In addition, the company noted that ""economic uncertainty may persist for some time,"" which could also weigh on buyer demand. The company raised its revenue guidance slightly for the year by $300 million and implied revenue growth of around 3%.', ""Despite these near-term headwinds, long-term factors should continue to favor D.R. Horton's core business. According to a recent analysis by realtor.com, the U.S. housing market continues to be short about 2.5 million homes. This shortage is due to a decade of underbuilding relative to population growth, and it will take some time to make up the gap."", 'D.R. Horton is a quality company that could face near-term headwinds from high interest rates and falling home prices. However, the stock trades at a reasonable valuation of 11.1 times earnings. It should continue to benefit from favorable trends behind its business, making the stock a solid one to buy and hold long term.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in D.r.

For reporting purposes, the USDA classifies households into two categories based on their level of food security. Those with high or marginal food security are considered food secure, while those experiencing low or very low food security are categorized as food insecure. This classification is determined by the household's responses to a series of questions regarding behaviours and experiences related to difficulty in meeting food needs.
