One noticeable trend this year has been the divergence in performance among different asset classes. While dividend stocks might not have kept pace with some of the more rapid-growth investments in recent months, their historical track record of stability and consistent returns remain a compelling factor for many investors. Over the years, dividends have played a big role in boosting overall investment gains, especially when people reinvest the money they receive from them. Since 1970, around 70% or more of the total profits from global stocks have come from compounded dividends.', 'Despite a lackluster performance in the current year, analysts hold an optimistic view regarding the prospects of dividend stocks. Ryan Lewenza, a senior vice president and portfolio manager at Turner Investments of Raymond James, discussed with BNN Bloomberg his preferred dividend sectors amidst the challenges posed by recent fluctuations in interest rates. He said that dividend stocks usually perform well during periods of low-interest rates. So, if those interest rates are to come down, then these beaten-up dividend stocks should start to rally. He further said that the telecom and the bank sectors currently have some of the best dividend stocks, offering juicy yields. In addition to this, dividend stocks are attractively valued in this environment. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“The Dow Jones Dividend Select Index has returned 8.8% annually in the last 20 odd years. That is 2% higher than TSX. So, you always need dividend stocks, especially in 2024.”', ""Mr. Lewenza's focus on long-term returns from dividend stocks aligns with findings from various reports reinforcing the value these stocks bring to investors over extended periods. A report from Middlefield examined the S&P 500's total return from December 31, 1992, to December 31, 2022, breaking it down into two key components. Of the impressive aggregate total return of +1,481%, 47% was attributed to dividends and their reinvestment. The remaining 53% was derived from price appreciation. This breakdown underscores the significant contribution dividends make to overall returns, comprising almost half of the total returns over this period."", 'Some of the best dividend stocks that are gaining traction among investors include The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

Higher crop commodity prices are contributing to healthy demand globally. Industrial demand has also recovered from the pandemic-related disruptions.The company expects demand to remain strong through the end of 2023 and into 2024, led by India and Brazil. Low channel inventories and favorable farm economics are expected to drive demand for nitrogen in North America. Increased planted corn acres and healthy farm economics are also expected to drive urea demand in Brazil. Moreover, urea demand in India is being supported by strong agricultural production.Moreover, CF Industries is benefiting from a decline in natural gas prices. CF Industries witnessed a significant decline in natural gas costs in the third quarter of 2023. Average cost of natural gas fell to $2.54 per MMBtu in the third quarter of 2023 from $8.35 per MMBtu in the year-ago quarter. Lower natural gas costs led to a decline in the company's cost of sales. The benefits of reduced gas costs are expected to continue in the fourth quarter.CF Industries also remains committed to boosting shareholders’ value by leveraging strong cash flows.

Each of our businesses continue to execute at a high level. Our momentum in the business is good, and volume remains robust. We can grow in a number of different ways. Contribution to our growth from new business remains strong and come from companies that either outsource their program today or they are managing it themselves.We continue to have great success cross-selling to existing customers. Retention levels are strong and remain at very attractive levels. Our value proposition of image, safety, cleanliness and compliance continues to resonate across businesses of all sizes and in all verticals. We continue to be pleased with the results from our focus on prospects within the verticals of healthcare, hospitality, education and state and local government.We recently announced the opening of 2 clean room facilities, one in North Carolina and the other in Wisconsin. These facilities will provide additional capacity in these regions in order to expand our efforts in this area of attractive growth from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The benefits of our strong volume growth and revenue flowed through to our bottom line. Gross margin for the second quarter grew 11.6% and operating income grew 12.3%. Diluted EPS grew 15.7% to $3.61. Cash flow remains strong. Net cash provided by operating activities in the second quarter grew 17.8% over the prior year. Our strong cash flow gives us flexibility to choose how we deploy our capital. In the second quarter, we continued to invest in our businesses. We also acquired several smaller businesses. On December 15, we paid shareholders $137.5 million in quarterly dividends, an increase of 17.1% from the amount paid to previous December.

Also, we are raising our annual diluted EPS expectations from a range of $14 to $14.45 to a range of $14.35 to $14.65, a growth rate of 10.5% to 12.8%. Mike?"", 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Thanks, Todd, and good morning. Our fiscal 2024 second quarter revenue was $2.38 billion compared to $2.1 billion last year. The organic revenue growth rate adjusted for acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, was 9%. Organic growth by business was 7.9% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services. 12.7% for First Aid and Safety Services, 17.8% for Fire Protection Services and 4.7% for Uniform Direct Sale.Gross margin for the second quarter of fiscal '24 was $1.14 billion compared to $1.02 billion last year, an increase of 11.6%. Gross margin as a percent of revenue was 48% for the second quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 47% last year, an increase of 100 basis points. Strong volume growth and continued operational efficiencies helped generate this strong gross margin.Gross margin percentage by business was 47.4% for Uniform Rental and Facility Services. 54.5% for First Aid and Safety Services, 48.6% for Fire Protection Services and 40.9% for Uniform Direct Sale.Gross margin for the Uniform Rental and Facility Services segment increased 40 basis points from last year. We continue to leverage our strong revenue growth and extracting efficiencies out of the business in order to expand margins. Our year-over-year improvements are no accident. Our Six Sigma and engineering teams have helped us create efficiencies in the plant to allow us to maximize the utilization of our equipment, labor and energy. Our SmartTruck technology allows us to improve our route efficiencies and provide density to our existing routes. While energy expenses comprised of gasoline, natural gas and electricity were a tailwind of 40 basis points from last year. Please keep in mind that some of the energy benefit is the result of efficiencies just mentioned. As an example, our rental revenue grew organically at 7.9%, but we only added 1% to our route structure since last year.Gross margin for the First Aid and Safety Services segment increased 400 basis points from last year. Our revenue growth is strong and value -- our value proposition continues to resonate in this segment. Health and safety of employees remains top of mind. Our mix of revenue continues to be healthy, including growing high-margin recurring revenue products like AED Rentals, eyewash stations and WaterBreak. We continue to use technology like SmartTruck to optimize our routes and improve efficiencies. And our First Aid dedicated distribution center allows us to lower product costs. All of these contribute to our improved margins.Selling and administrative expenses grew $64.4 million or 11.1% over last year. Strong revenue growth creates leverage, which allows us to invest in the business. We continue to invest in our people, adding selling resources, investing in our management trainee program to develop future leaders and expanding our talent acquisition efforts.Operating income of $499.7 million compared to $444.9 million last year. Operating income as a percent of revenue was 21% in the second quarter of fiscal '24 compared to 20.5% in last year's second quarter, an increase of 50 basis points. Our effective tax rate for the second quarter was 20.9% compared to 22.1% last year. The tax rates in both quarters were impacted by certain discrete items, primarily the tax accounting impact for stock-based compensation. Net income for the second quarter was $374.6 million compared to $324.3 million last year. This year's second quarter diluted EPS of $3.61 compared to $3.12 last year. An increase of 15.7%.Todd provided our annual financial guidance. Related to the guidance, please note the following: fiscal '24 interest expense is expected to be $100 million compared to $109.5 million in fiscal '23, predominantly as a result of less variable rate debt.Our fiscal '24 effective tax rate is expected to be 21.3%. This compares to a rate of 20.4% in fiscal '23. The higher effective tax rate negatively impacts fiscal '24 EPS guidance by about $0.16 and diluted EPS growth by about 120 basis points.Our financial guidance does not include the impact of any future share buybacks. And guidance includes the impact of having one more workday in fiscal '23 compared to fiscal -- I'm sorry, fiscal '24 compared to fiscal '23. This extra workday comes in our fiscal third quarter."", 'Jared S. Mattingley', 'Thanks, Mike. That concludes our prepared remarks. Now we are happy to answer questions from the analysts. Please ask just 1 question and a single follow-up if needed. Thank you.', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions)And our first question comes from Ashish Sabadra from RBC.', 'Ashish Sabadra', 'Just on the 4 verticals that you highlighted, as the areas of strength in particular. I was wondering if you can quantify how big the combined revenues are from those verticals and how does the growth profile there compared to the company average? Any color?', 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Ashish, this is Todd. Thanks for the question. Yes, we don't -- I don't have a specific number for you as far as that exact number. But I can tell you that our verticals are performing quite well. We're having really good success. Our focus around not just selling, but organizing around those is really paying off for us. I've just got a couple of wins I can share with you regarding the verticals. In healthcare, in the acute space, we're having good success and nonacute as well. We've got a Scrub Rental Program to a big hospital network in South Carolina that is benefiting from new consistent image but also identification. The customer told us that they were interested in being able to identify their people, understanding who was supposed to be in what area, and this new scrub program did that. We had a really similar experience with a nursing home in Virginia. Same thing. They were buying their own and they -- but the leadership wanted to be able to identify and have a consistent image with their people. We had a -- on the acute side, again, a hospital in Florida that we rolled out a new microfiber program because they were struggling with inventory control and product quality, which led to cleanliness concerns. And our program offered some great products, technology to control the inventory, which allowed them to focus more on their patients instead of having to pull around with trying to manage the microfiber. And I've got a couple of other examples I thought might be helpful for the group. In our government sector, we have -- we just recently rolled out a First Aid and AED Rental Program to a public library system in California, which is -- you wouldn't think of a public library system as being a great prospect for us, but it is. They realize that the value would bring to their employees and being prepared with the AEDs in case it was needed because the public is in their locations. And then lastly, I'll just share it with you a little bit on education, a variety of wins there. We had a chemistry department at a nice-size university in Virginia. They put all their educators and students in a Lab Coat Program, maintenance department at a university in California, put all of their people in Carhartt uniforms, rental program from us. They love the Carhartt. And then the last item would be there was a dining facility at a University in Arizona where they put all their culinary people in Chef Works, which is a big win for those folks. The branded programs with Carhartt and Chef Works were big wins. So I don't want to belabor it, but I thought I would just share a few wins because I know verticals are of interest to yourself, Ashish, but also plenty of other folks on the call."", 'J. Michael Hansen', 'Yes. The only other thing I might add is, as Todd just talked about, we have so many ways to win. And clearly, those verticals are growing faster than the average. So we still are seeing really good momentum in each of those.', 'Ashish Sabadra', ""That's great color and thanks for sharing those wins. It does provide a lot more clarity on those verticals. And if I can ask a quick follow-up. I was just wondering if there's -- if you could share any update on your technology, the SmartTruck Program and particularly the partnership with Google, Verizon and SAP. Any updates on that front?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Certainly. I think how -- one of the things we have around here, we don't make money when the wheels are moving. We make money when the wheels stop. And so we're -- the way Mike described it, in total for our company, we grew revenues over 9%, but we only added 1% to our route structure in total. So that means we're spending more time with the customer, less time driving, which is better for our customers, better for our partners and better for Cintas. So we're pleased with that. Our technology -- and we still have plenty of room to go there. We're focused on bringing those efficiencies, extracting out the inefficiencies in our business. We sent out a note -- a press release regarding our migration this quarter to the Google Cloud. That has been very successful for us. There's a number of benefits that we get from moving from a server farm to the Google Cloud. The first one is, it's more secure, so very important to us. Second item is over time, we believe we will -- that will be more cost effective for us. And the third is it gives us access to Google's AI platform. So certainly in the very, very early innings, we just migrated. But we think that, that will be able to help us longer term in making it more attractive -- making it easier to do business with Cintas, making sure that we are positioning our people to be successful to point them in the right direction and leverage that type of -- those types of tools."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Manav Patnaik from Barclays Capital.', 'Manav Shiv Patnaik', ""Todd, just to follow up on all the wins and contracts you talked about. Maybe I guess the question is more on the competitive environment versus -- is this just first-time outsources any trends, any changes you're seeing from that front, the new business percentage you've called out before, but whether that's more market share or just first-time outsourcing?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Good morning, Manav. Great question. As Mike said, we win in many ways. We have been selling no programmers since the inception of my career. I can tell you that. And we continue to. And I'll just remind you, there's -- we service a little over 1 million businesses, but there are 16 million businesses in the U.S. and Canada. So there's plenty of opportunity there. And we like both. We certainly win some from the competitors. We like growing the pie. And then the examples I was giving, it's a mix. But in large part, it is -- they were either doing it in-house, meaning they were processing microfibers in-house or they were telling their employees to go buy product.So there's different variations of no programmers. Meaning some are just -- we're buying products and providing it to their people and telling them to wear them, some of them, they were just telling them to show up to work and look good. But nevertheless, we bring so much better consistent program identification, cleanliness, all these and compliance are big drivers for our customers."", 'Manav Shiv Patnaik', 'Got it. And then just on the capital allocation front, I mean, the buyback number, one of the bigger quarters for a while now. I mean is that any indication of the M&A market slowing down? Or just how we should think about that balance there?', 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Manav, we -- no change in what we're seeing in M&A. Still, we're working the pipeline as best we can. We've made some nice acquisitions this year. From a buyback perspective, you've heard us speak to it being an opportunistic execution. And that's what you saw this quarter. As we think back about our first quarter results, and we thought they were pretty good. The stock reacted a little bit negatively, and we saw that as a nice opportunity, and we took advantage of it. So that's -- it was a good example during the quarter of an opportunistic execution of that buyback program. And the beauty, Manav, as we speak about our capital allocation, we don't always have to choose, right? In the quarter or maybe, let's call it, for the year, we've invested in the business, as we've talked about, our CapEx is up, which is important to us as a part of that investment. M&A is up from last year. Dividends are up 17% from last year, and we've been able to execute on the buyback program. And so when you hear us talk about the sort of the 4 levers of capital allocation, we've done them all, I think, nicely this year. And again, the beauty of our cash flow and our balance sheet is we don't really have to choose."", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Mike, I would just add that we think we're being really good fiduciaries of our shareholders' investments. Mike mentioned all the levers. And the net-net of that is we still have great dry powder which allows us to take on M&A of all shapes and sizes, and we're interested in that."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Joshua Chan from UBS.', 'Joshua K. Chan', 'So Todd, you mentioned the opening of the Clean Rooms. I was just wondering if you can kind of frame for us what you see as the attractive parts of this business? How is it attractive? And what kind of opportunity does it mean for Cintas going forward in the Clean Rooms?', 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Thanks for the question, Josh. Yes, the Clean Room business is, it's an attractive sector for us. I mentioned pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. And there's -- it seems like there's more and more every year that need that level of cleaning -- that level of cleanliness. So that is -- we think that bodes well for that business in the future.And there has been -- you've seen some momentum on onshoring in that area. And we want to make sure that we have the appropriate capacity to serve our current customers and that we're prepared for the future as well. So we like the trends in that business, and we like the business."", 'Joshua K. Chan', 'Great. And then if I can follow up with the margin question. I guess, if in the future, the energy favorability were to lessen. Could you talk through the opportunities that you still have to drive margin expansion and the targeted incremental margins going forward without as much energy tailwind?', 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Yes. Great question. Yes. So we recognize that energy prices go up and they go down. But one thing that's going to be consistent is we're going to be focused on extracting out inefficiencies in our route structure and then our production facilities. So that will be really important to us. And we think there's certainly ample opportunity there still to go. We talked about the SmartTruck technology. That's been impactful to us in many ways. But what's also impactful is, as Mike mentioned, our Six Sigma team of professionals, our engineering professionals and then layering in with that technology allows us to have a centralized visibility into our operations at a level that we've never had before in the history of the company. This technology allows us. So -- and it allows us to maximize our labor, our equipment, ultimately our energy spend. So -- and we're focused on extracting out those inefficiencies so that we can manage it moving forward. We love when energy goes -- costs go down, but we recognize those markets will move, but we're going to be focused on extracting out those inefficiencies."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Heather Balsky from Bank of America.', 'Heather Nicole Balsky', ""First question with regards to the programmers and nonprogrammers, as we're further in further out from the COVID period. Are you still seeing the shift in demand in terms of more nonprogrammers looking to outsource? Or do you think it's starting to normalize back to pre-COVID trend?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Well, Heather, it's a great question. I'll start, and Mike, feel free to chime in. We're -- there's various reasons why a prospect would turn into a customer going from a no programmer to a customer. One of them is, hey, we're -- we'd like to outsource it because we're not very good at it or we're not -- we don't have -- we're struggling to staff and we're struggling to find people to manage this. So that still continues. But there are other reasons. So it might be -- we don't like the image that we're portraying. We don't like the lack of identification. We don't lack the lack of compliance. You can provide them, and we know that they're hygienically cleaned. So there's many different motives. One of it might be, hey, we can't staff and we need help. And we still see that, frankly, and it allows our customers to focus on what's most important to them, taking care of their customers, their patients, their guests, whatever it is, instead of having to manage through these various programs."", 'J. Michael Hansen', 'Heather, the note programmers is still -- we get more than 60% of our new business comes from no programmers. Your reference to the pandemic might be -- we did certainly in the early days of the pandemic, see an increase in personal protective equipment and things like hand sanitizer, those have normalized back to what we would call normal and ongoing levels. So that might be the only change that we had and back to normal.', 'Heather Nicole Balsky', ""Okay. And then on the margin front, we're just kind of curious when you think about -- you talked earlier about opportunities for efficiencies and further route productivity. When you think about the source of those savings, how much are just organic Six Sigma effort, how much is coming from your SAP? And are there still G&K synergy or opportunities that you're kind of benefiting from?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Heather, it's a good question. We don't really discern the difference between our Six Sigma team, our engineering team and our technologies. They all have to work, be orchestrated appropriately to get the efficiencies. So and that's exactly what we're doing. So everybody has to be involved, and that's what produces the great results. As for G&K, we're -- we've now -- we're, I think, about 6.5 years since we acquired if my math is correct. So I wouldn't say that there's anything left on the bone there."", 'Operator', 'And your next question comes from Andy Wittmann from R.W. Baird.', 'Andrew John Wittmann', ""I guess I just wanted to ask on the outlook a little bit here, Mike. The second half total revenue guidance is in the 7% range at the midpoint against an organic 9% quarter here. So a degree of deceleration. I guess I was implicit in your previous guidance as well. But I just thought maybe give you a chance to elaborate a little bit more on that, talk about what you're seeing in the macro? And if that's just you guys being kind of your normal prudent approach or if there's something that we should be considering?"", 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Andy, I'd lead with, it's our normal prudent approach. And when you think about where we are, we've talked a little bit already about the growth is still good, momentum is good. And so we like where the business is going. The range for the back half of the year, certainly does imply a little bit over 7% at the midpoint, 8% -- a little over 8% at the high point. We like that range. The cadence is good for us, as you know. But look, as we look into calendar '24, there's certainly is a little bit of uncertainty as to what the new economy may bring, what the Fed movements may bring. And so we think it is wise to be prudent as we look out."", 'Andrew John Wittmann', ""Great. That's my only question for today. Have a merry Christmas, guys."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from George Tong from Goldman Sachs.', 'Keen Fai Tong', 'Earlier, you mentioned that business momentum was good. Volumes were robust in the quarter. Can you provide more color on overall customer budget trends and customer sentiment? And any changes that you might be seeing in the sales cycle?', 'Todd M. Schneider', ""George, we -- forward-looking, as Mike said, there's always -- we're not trying to prognosticate exactly how our customers will react to the turning of the calendar year. But we're not seeing any change in sales cycles and we haven't seen a change in our customer base and how they're reacting to what's going on in the marketplace. So it's kind of business has been consistent. And it's more what Mike preferred to the turn out of the calendar year, and we'll see how businesses react coming out of the holidays."", 'Keen Fai Tong', ""Got it. That's helpful. And also you mentioned cross-selling was good in the quarter. Can you elaborate more on cross-selling trends that you're seeing in which areas you're seeing most amount of bundling or upsell, cross-sell from?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""George, cross-sell is -- it's an important component of our growth. And the nature of it is we're having good success across all of our areas of our business. We're blessed to be in a position where our customers -- fortunately, they really like us. They like our relationships. We have people in their businesses on a really frequent basis, mostly on a weekly basis. So they -- and we have -- so that means we have eyes, ears and minds in their business, and we can help. And it doesn't matter to us what a customer might lead with, whatever they're interested in, but then we will quickly pivot and that we can help them in many ways. So -- but just the nature of the size of the rental division is such that because there are so many customers there. There's plenty of opportunity for our First Aid and Fire business to cross-sell into that just because of the numbers there. But nevertheless, it's working quite well across all of our organization. We share leads, we share thoughts. And we make sure that the customer is well taken care of."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Tim Mulrooney from William Blair.', 'Timothy Michael Mulrooney', 'Yes. I just wanted to ask 1 question. Pricing now normalized back to the 2% range. I mean that means your organic growth was comprised of approximately 7 points of volume. I was just hoping you could dig into that a little bit more because it was a little stronger than I think most of us were expecting. Did you see an uptick in retention? Did you have a strong quarter with that cross-sell or maybe new account growth? And any details would be helpful.', 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Tim, so our new business is robust. As I mentioned, retention levels are very good and our cross-sell is very good. And the pricing is still -- it's lower than last year. It is higher than historical, but it's certainly getting much closer to historical. So -- but when -- so when you think about that, it is our various inputs growth are all performing well, and we expect that to continue."", 'J. Michael Hansen', 'And as we talked, we win in a lot of ways and the momentum in the rental business is still really good. But we also saw in the quarter some really nice acceleration in First Aid and Safety from 11% in the first quarter to 12.7% organically in the second quarter. And we saw some nice improvement in Fire, where we went from a little over 14% in the first quarter to 17.8% in the second quarter. So we just see some really good momentum in all of our businesses and particularly those 2 had some really nice performance in the second quarter.', 'Timothy Michael Mulrooney', ""Yes. I did notice that reacceleration across both those businesses. That's helpful."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan Securities.', 'Andrew Charles Steinerman', 'Could you just mention if your ad stops directionally and the Uniform Rental business was up, down or flat recently?', 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Andrew, our ad stop metrics are -- have been pretty consistent. We haven't seen much of a change in our customer base. And so I'd say that's how I would describe it. We see still positive trends in our ad stop metrics. And -- but it's -- that's pretty consistent as it has been for the last 6 to 12 months."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jasper Bibb from Truist Securities.', 'Jasper James Bibb', 'You mentioned the year-on-year tailwind from energy, but I was just hoping to get some additional color on other cost inputs, I guess, specifically labor and materials.', 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Yes. I'll start, Jasper. Our -- we're seeing -- just like you're seeing with the inflation in total, we're seeing that come down. It's never coming down as fast as we like, but we are seeing it. Cotton has stabilized, and we're seeing freight come down and that's important to us. And the labor market is -- it's easier, it's still not easy, but it is easier. So I think that probably the right way to think about it would be as the labor market eases and that will lessen pressure on wage growth as well."", 'Jasper James Bibb', ""And then I wanted to follow up on First Aid. Operating margins there were really strong in the first half. Should we think about these like low 20% level is sustainable going forward? And would you say there's anything that's changed there that's unlocked another leg of operating margin expansion year-to-date?"", 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Sure. Jasper, we have seen some nice performance in that business. And I spoke to a few of them where from a margin perspective, first of all, the value that we sell with, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our employees is really still resonating well. And so our growth has been really good in that business. We talked a little bit in the opening comments about the sort of the recurring revenue streams of AED rentals, our eyewash stations and our WaterBreak. And these have been great businesses for us. The growth has been really good and the margins are great for us. Many times, these are add-on products to existing customers. But all 3 of them, we install. And then we have a recurring service program that goes on after that. And again, it leads to really nice stickiness and also nice margins.The other thing that I'll point out is we opened a First Aid and Safety Distribution Center a couple of years ago. And that allows us to source more. It allows us to centralize some of our sourcing. And those kind of things lead to a better product cost. And that, again, drives down the material cost in our First Aid and Safety business. So the combination of really good sales mix, really good growth in the business, good sourcing.The one I didn't mention was SmartTruck technology that is also having a benefit there. All of those things are contributing. And so this is not a case of 6 months of sort of unusual items. This is a little bit of a lot of hard work and execution by our First Aid and Safety partners to really get this margin going."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank Securities.', 'Faiza Alwy', ""So I wanted to follow up on both the First Aid business and the Fire business. You touched on the First Aid a little bit. But curious on what's driving the acceleration. If you could expand on that, both on First Aid and Fire. And then as we think about your outlook, do you expect this level of growth to sustain looking ahead? And I know in Fire, you talked about an SAP implementation that was happening in this fiscal year. So maybe is that helping the top line? Has that happened? How should we think about margins going forward in that business?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Faiza, thanks for the question. We really like the Fire business. It's the only business we're in where you legally have to have it. So there is, I'll call it, double negative. No program market. Everyone is a programmer, but we are able to cross-sell very well into that market. We are using various technologies that Mike referenced to make sure that we're positioning our partners to be more successful, meaning we use SmartTruck technology in all of our businesses, and that helps us. But we're getting leverage from our growth, and the growth is attractive, and we think it's -- there's certainly running a business isn't linear. So there will be ebbs and flows, but we like the long-term outlook for the Fire business.That being said, as you mentioned, we are going through an SAP implementation. We certainly -- we haven't even implemented at this point. So we haven't seen any benefits just yet, but we're optimistic about how that can help our business over the coming years."", 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Maybe I'll add 2 things to the Fire and a little bit of First Aid too. As the market opportunity in those businesses is really large. And our expectation, as we've talked about, is that those businesses will continue into the future near that double-digit type of a place. Again, the market opportunity is really large.One last comment on the SAP. We've not started it. And so as we get into that, which is likely going to be more about next fiscal year, we may see a little bit of pressure in the Fire segment because as you can imagine, when you turn -- when you start to go into an SAP conversion, you don't get benefits overnight. It takes a little bit of time. So we'll have some additional costs in '25 and certainly then setting up really nice benefits into the future for that business."", 'Faiza Alwy', ""Great. And then if I could just follow up on the macro environment. You made some comments in response to a previous question around just you're being prudent and there is some uncertainty. Just given sort of how well you're doing on programmers and the momentum you're seeing in sort of these other businesses, I'm curious if you can -- if you have -- if you can give us a framework in terms of how we should think about the impact of macro on your business."", 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Well, I'll start Faiza with -- our history has been we grow certainly in multiples of GDP and employment growth. And you hit it. We are able to sell into no programmers even when they're not, let's say, adding people, we can take pressure off of them by managing programs for them. So our new business effort is always really good. But certainly, if we see turns in the economy, we've got to adjust potentially if we see our customers start to reduce their number of people we've got to adjust. And so it is prudent for us to sort of think about that as we look into our guidance and into the future of the business."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Seth Weber from Wells Fargo.', 'Seth Robert Weber', ""Happy holidays. I wanted to just go back to the Clean Room discussion for a minute. If there's any way to frame how we should be thinking about that new facility openings? And are those facilities higher CapEx relative to a traditional facility? Is there any way to combine facilities? Or I'm just trying to get a better understanding of this opportunity and what the investment might be for Cintas going forward."", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Yes. Seth, thank you for the question. As you know, that's a segment of the uniform market. As I mentioned earlier, it does seem more companies over the last decade or so have higher cleaning quality requirements. So we think there's a tailwind there.As far as the CapEx required for a facility like that, it's -- you can think of it as very similar to a uniform facility. The only difference, I think, that you may want to think about is it serves usually a larger geographic area than we would with a traditional facility. And the reason being is we only have so many of them, and they have to cover the customer base. So as a result of that, they do cover -- we do cover a larger geographic area for -- out of each of those facilities."", 'Seth Robert Weber', ""Okay. That's helpful. And is there any way for us to think about how many of these facilities you might be opening over the next couple of years, relative -- I mean, I saw the press release for the Wisconsin facility, but is this order of magnitude, 1s and 2s? Or could this be much, much bigger going forward?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Yes. Seth, I wouldn't -- you're not going to see 1s and 2s coming out every quarter or every year based upon the size of the market. So it certainly won't be anywhere near that pace. But it will be paced based upon the demand from the marketplace, if those -- there's more and more customers that are interested in it, then we'll be prepared to meet that demand."", 'Seth Robert Weber', ""Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on the direct -- it was nice to see the direct sales business turn to be positive again in the quarter. Is there any color on whether that's coming more from the service side of your customer base, more on the manufacturing side? And any just detail there? Or is it just kind of across the board?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Good question, Seth. The design collective business, the direct sale portion of it, as we've spoken in the past, it's certainly lumpier. And so as far as where that growth is coming from, it's really more national accounts where we would get it, hospitality, lodging, and when they have rollouts or new allotment programs, you tend to get spikes and then -- so we love the spikes and then the -- what comes after the spike isn't as good, but I wouldn't think about it as a big growth engine for us."", 'J. Michael Hansen', 'Yes, we typically would say in the low to mid-single-digit growth. So this quarter is sort of right in line with that expectation.', 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Stephanie Moore from Jefferies.', 'Stephanie Lynn Benjamin Moore', ""I wanted to touch a bit on maybe the cross-sell opportunity over time. I think you've provided -- you continue to execute very well on your investments that you see on the technology front and called out just the enhanced visibility that you have. So maybe you can talk about, given some of these investments, what this might mean for cross-selling, meeting the opportunity to add those additional products and kind of continue to further penetrate each existing customer. So kind of how are you balancing the incremental products that you can offer over time."", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Stephanie. Well, you can think about it, we call it cross-sell. There's -- cross-sell is really a division to division. There's also upsell, which would be -- we have products that -- our customers don't use all of our products, even within the Rental division or the First Aid division what have you. So those are all components of growth for us, and we see a significant massive, frankly, runway in all those areas. So we're trying to position our employee partners to make sure that they're in the right spot and have the right information to help the customer. And then we're also continually, as part of our corporate culture is to invest in new products and new services. We're always working on that. And we get those ideas from those customers. And then we test them and then we launch them, and we're always working on that. It's always been a component of our growth and always will be."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Scott Schneeberger from Oppenheimer.', 'Scott Andrew Schneeberger', ""My first one, I'm going to delve into the SG&A running low double digits growth something you did last year as well. And you cited investment in selling resources, management trainee program, tech and also some talent acquisition efforts. Just curious -- and you guys have said on this call, labor is getting better, but still a little tough. Could you elaborate on the labor aspect and kind of what you guys are doing pushing the selling? And then also curious about the tech aspect. Maybe you've already covered it in the call, if that's what you meant, but just wondering if there's anything extra there."", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Scott, we're -- the items that you mentioned, they're all really important to us. We are -- there's not one that I would call out. But I would think about it this way. We think the future is really bright and we want to invest for the future. We know we need the talent acquisition team to be attracting the very best talent. The management trainee programs is our leaders of the future. And we think they are a critical pipeline and we're going to need those leaders. And then the selling resources are -- we see it looks -- we think the future is bright with our -- how many customers we have, what the size of the market is. I mentioned 1 million customers, about 16 million businesses. So that's all great. And then you kind of wrap it all with technology because technology will -- we want to make it easier to do business with us. And we want to leverage technology to make our partners more successful. Point them in the right direction, give them the right tools in their toolbox to spend their time in the right spots, but also to make it easier for the customer to buy, easier to do business with in totality."", 'Scott Andrew Schneeberger', ""Great. Appreciate that. And then not a lot of acquisition activity in the quarter, but there was some -- and there was a good amount in the first quarter. I remember you saying it was across all businesses, but we didn't hit it up too much last quarter. Could you talk about what it is that you're acquiring and clearly across segments, but what the strategies have been there?"", 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Sure. Not a lot of change in the strategy, Scott, and that is we love rental tuck-in opportunities, and we've made a number of those this year. And as you can imagine, when we do that in a marketplace, we add immediate capacity utilization improvement, route density. And so those things really help us in the rental business. So we've made some of those. We certainly have made some First Aid acquisitions, and we've made Fire acquisitions. Again, the dynamic is similar in all 3 of these. These are really nice tuck-in opportunities that just strengthen our business in the local markets in which we acquire them, and we'll continue to look for those opportunities as best we can."", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""One thing I might add is, to Mike's point, we get synergies. It helps us with density, helps us with capacity utilization, allowed us to spend more time with the customers. So all that's valuable. But in each of the businesses, depending upon the business we acquire. But normally, when we make an acquisition in Rental, First Aid or Fire, we're able to provide an offering to that customer base that's broader than what they had in the past. So the rental waiver broader offering than most companies out there, certainly in the First Aid, we do as well. And depending upon the Fire acquisition, that's very consistent, separate from then we can cross-sell. So it's just -- it adds nice value."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.', 'Shlomo H. Rosenbaum', 'This is a question basically for Mike. Just a little bit going through some of the technical items in the quarter. Receivables days were up 2 days sequentially. I was wondering if there was a lot of business that came in at the end of the quarter. Are you seeing any changing patterns in what clients are paying? Or are there any other factors in that? Because the last time we saw 48 days was during COVID.', 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Shlomo, we -- our -- when our quarters end on a holiday, and it seems like too many of them do, it does create a little bit of disruption in terms of the ability to collect the mail, the application. We have seen maybe just a touch of slowing in the AR, but we've not seen any, I'll say, deterioration from the standpoint of additional write-offs. But we did see a little bit of slowing and the Thanksgiving Holiday can usually contribute to that."", 'Shlomo H. Rosenbaum', ""Okay. Then in the OPM, the operating margin, the other unit was up very nicely sequentially, even though the -- there's one less day sequentially in the quarter. Can you just give us some of the mechanics or tell us just what's going on, on the ground over there. It's increasing the margin very nicely. And is that something that we should expect to continue at kind of that 16% level?"", 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Well, we -- certainly, the revenue growth is powerful in all of our businesses. And when we see some really nice revenue growth, that's important. The other thing that I would say is the Uniform Direct Sale business went from a negative 2.7% in terms of revenue growth to 4.7%. And that is important for operating margins, too. So we did see some nice improvement there in the direct sale. Nothing I would say that is noteworthy other than, again, some nice acceleration in the revenue."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Leo Carrington from Citigroup.', 'Leo Carrington', 'If I could ask a follow-up on that points around the one-off or the costs that you called out in Q2 around talent acquisition, training, technology. Were you calling them out to any of these one-off increases in nature or more to highlight where the spend is? And then in terms of the underlying margins and drop through in Q2 on your organic growth. Do you see that as sustainable when you factor in the additional investment this quarter?', 'J. Michael Hansen', ""Well, Leo, I'll start with -- we called them out because we think it's important to make sure that our investors understand that we are looking at the long term, and we want to continue to invest in the business. And those investments are really important, and they set up, let's say, more penetration opportunities, more cross-sell opportunities, but also productivity improvements, capacity utilization opportunities. In these cases, we wanted to call them out to show that, look, we're focused on the long term, and we're going to continue in the business. As Todd said a couple of times, the future is bright for us, and we want to make sure that we take advantage of that bright future by investing in the business. And the call-outs were really more about that. The future is bright. In the quarter, we had incremental margins of 27%. Look, our expectation is that we're going to be in the 20% to 30% range going forward. We recognize that when we're sitting at 21%, they need to be in the higher level of that range. And we think that's -- that we can continue to do that. And when we talk about things like SAP and technology and other investments, and by the way, we're able to get 27% even when we're investing in the business. But we give those to say we're setting up those future margin and revenue opportunities. It's important for us to, I think, communicate that."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.', 'Toni Michele Kaplan', ""You mentioned the success that you've had with the branded products earlier, particularly with Carhartt and Chef Works. Could you just remind us if these are exclusive relationships and how long the relationships are for? And then are there any other areas that could benefit from branded products or equipment that you could offer as well?"", 'Todd M. Schneider', ""Toni, thank you for the question. So we've had a long-standing relationship with Carhartt and Chef Works. And we are the exclusive licensees for those folks -- for those companies on the rental programs. And so we work with them to design products that the end users want, want to wear and -- but also that goes very well through our processing systems. So that's all very important to us.As far as -- we don't get into contractual arrangements with them, but I can tell you this. We love products that our end users are -- that get excited about wearing them. And Carhartt and Chef Works are 2 great examples of that in great companies, great brands, great products. And as far as are there other opportunities, we're constantly looking for that. And we spend a lot of time with our customers and with our working partners to talk about that and to see where those opportunities are come from. But those are 2 great relationships, long-standing relationships that are really important to us."", 'Toni Michele Kaplan', 'Yes. Terrific. Maybe if you could just give us your latest thoughts on potential international expansion, that would be great.', 'Todd M. Schneider', ""I'd say, similar to products. We're always looking at those types of opportunities. We certainly know stay in contact with the people that are running those businesses. But the great news is we don't have to do that to -- in order to be really, really successful in the future. We look at it and say there's -- again we're servicing about 1 million [businesses]. There's 16 million businesses in U.S. and Canada. Here's what's really exciting is by the time we get to 2 million customers, there will be more than 16 million businesses in the U.S. and Canada. So that's kind of a bummer if you're running a race, but it's really exciting if you're running a business because once we get to the 2-mile mark, the race is going to be extended. So that's separate from -- we're going to have more products and services over the coming years. So all that being said is we continue to watch it. We evaluate it. We look for the right opportunity. And if that opportunity presents itself, then we will seize it, but certainly not -- it's not required in order for us to be successful in the future."", 'Operator', ""And at this time, there are no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Jared Mattingley to close out the call."", 'Jared S. Mattingley', ""Thank you for joining us this morning. We will issue our third quarter of fiscal '24 financial results in March. We look forward to speaking with you again at that time."", 'Operator', ""This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.""]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of Bill Gates' investment philosophy and his major investments, and go directly to read Bill Gates' Top 5 Dividend Stocks.\xa0"", ""Every investor dreams of accumulating higher returns and making massive profits while investing in the equity markets. While the focus is always on gaining from the share value appreciation, it's not the only way to book profits in the stock markets. Investing in dividend stocks offers one of the best ways of reaping a steady and consistent source of income even when the overall market is under pressure."", 'The best dividend stocks are companies with a strong foothold and solid presence in their respective industries. Nevertheless, dividend stocks are broadly classified into two. Dividend growth stocks are of established companies that have achieved maturity peak. While such companies may not offer higher yields than companies in the same sector, they are cherished as they consistently increase their dividend payouts.', 'On the other hand, high-yield dividend stocks may keep their rate the same as they are already paying much more. Knowing which stock to invest in for dividends can always be challenging, given the myriads of companies offering such payouts. However, that should never be the case when one knows where to look for.', 'One of the best ways of discovering the best dividend stocks for steady income entails following what professionals do. Bill Gates has always been a staunch supporter of technology, given its potential to drive positive change. It is a picture well painted by technology stocks accounting for the most significant portion of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.', 'Ranked as one of the wealthiest people in the world, Gates also has a well-documented affinity for\xa0pursuing dividend income\xa0in the equity markets. Therefore, tracking and following what Gates does and invests in through the Trust is one of the best ways of gaining a head start in investing for dividends.', 'Investing in dividend stocks has always been one of the billionaire investor strategies for generating reliable passive income for supporting a myriad of philanthropic activities. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation finances various global issues, including healthcare, poverty alleviation education, and access to information technology. The Trust also invests in endowments to generate much-needed returns to support philanthropic efforts.', 'As the Trust expands its footprint to reach millions of people in low-income countries worldwide, it has increased its focus and investments in the top dividend stocks that generate consistent dividend income. The investment strategy has allowed the foundation to generate sufficient returns to be able to spend\xa0over $53 billion in grant donations\xa0and other humanitarian activities.', ""While Gates generates a staggering\xa0$464.5 million from his dividend portfolio, most of the gains are based on picking companies with strong and growing dividend yields. Focusing on solid yields rather than high yields affirms the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's affinity for sustainable long-term income streams. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) are some of the companies that Gates has always turned to, given their track record in paying dividends."", 'Diversification has also been an important strategy that Gates has always relied on, even as he pursued dividend income in the markets. This is evident by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust investing in various sectors, including technology. The investment strategy has allowed the billionaire investor to generate consistent dividend income regardless of the prevailing economic situation.', 'The Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to 5.25% is already putting pressure on growth stocks, especially in the technology sector. With the high-interest rate environment expected to remain in place for much longer, growth stocks may have to contend with high-interest expenses from bonds, loans, and convertible debt.', ""Increased interest expenditure from various financing options is likely to pressure companies' earnings, which could affect dividend offering allocations. Money losing technology stocks remain the most vulnerable in a high-interest rate environment as they are the ones that raise significant capital to sustain research and development operations."", 'On the other hand, financial companies are expected to remain resilient as they make more money on high-interest rates on lending to people, companies, and other businesses. Therefore, diversifying an investment portfolio beyond technology stocks and into financials and consumer goods sectors that perform well amid rising interest rates is a sure way of safeguarding passive income through dividends.', 'Our Methodology', ""Bill Gates concentrates most of his holdings on stocks with a track record of growing and paying dividends over time. Likewise, we have analyzed 13F Fillings and selected top dividend stocks in Bill Gates' portfolio as of Q3 2023. The stocks are ranked in terms of stake value. The chosen stocks vary by size and industry. Still, they are all well positioned to generate long-term dividend income amid the high-interest rate environment going by their impressive payout record.

Despite these quarterly fluctuations in product sales, we are encouraged by several long-term trends, including: (1) revenue from higher-margin services like the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Pay, which are growing faster than the overall business, driving better revenue visibility and higher free-cash-flow (FCF) margins; (2) continued gains in global market share in smartphones, wearables, and other hardware categories; and (3) consistent returns of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.

These factors predominantly have been affecting budget-conscious consumers, leading them to opt for smaller pack sizes and prioritize lower shelf prices. As a result, consumers are choosing smaller shopping baskets and gravitating toward more cost-effective items to manage their budgets effectively. Despite moderation in inflation, the unpredictable economic landscape and its influence on consumer spending patterns continue to pose challenges to supermarket companies’ revenues.Escalated Costs Erode Margins: Companies have been facing escalating operational expenses in their efforts to step up performance. Factors such as the costs associated with store renovations and increased wages are putting pressure on the profit margins of companies. The ongoing technological investments made by supermarket entities to strengthen their online operations, along with other promotional activities, further contribute to the strain on profit margins.Strong Omnichannel Efforts: Supermarket retailers have spared no effort in fortifying their operations both online and offline. Companies have been benefiting from their focus on store improvisation, merchandise enhancement, prudent pricing strategy and efforts to replenish assortments. Moreover, industry players are pushing the boundaries to enhance their online presence. The surge in online shopping has prompted companies to consistently intensify their endeavors in this arena through acquisitions, partnerships and the enhancement of delivery and payment systems. In this regard, companies have been benefiting from their same-day delivery, buy online and pick-up in-store, curbside pickup and contactless payment options. Companies’ concerted efforts to unite store and online operations to offer customers a solid omnichannel experience keep them well-placed for growth.

In fiscal 2023, the company’s cost of sales increased 5.1% year over year. High commodity prices due to inflationary pressure are pushing up the cost of sales.Forex Woes: Given its widespread presence in international markets, Johnson Controls is exposed to unfavorable foreign currency movements. Adverse foreign currency translations impacted the company’s top line to the tune of $616 million in fiscal 2023.Potential Risks from Competition: Johnson Controls’ products and operations are excessively reliant on information technology infrastructure, creating increased cyber security risks, which could materially impact its competitive position.

Despite a challenging macroeconomic environment owing to geopolitical conflicts, inflationary pressures and uncertain business conditions, the industry seemed to have benefited from a higher demand for scalable infrastructure for seamless connectivity amid a wide proliferation of IoT devices.Steady investments by leading carriers to upgrade their network infrastructure and increase their fiber footprint to meet the growing demand for flexible data, video, voice and IP solutions also seemed to have buoyed the sector. \xa0However, demand-supply imbalance and volatility in raw material prices owing to a shortage of chips, which are the building blocks for various technological equipment, have largely affected the profitability of companies due to inflated equipment prices. In order to weed off the liquidity crisis, various firms resorted to cost-cutting measures such as furloughs, layoffs and reduction in discretionary expenses.Some other firms looked beyond the short-term funding avenues, such as revolving lines of bank credit, to bridge temporary cash shortfalls. Some others have employed dividend cuts or suspension of dividend payments until the overall situation improved. Although a bulk of the firms across diverse sectors has increasingly followed the drift, a handful has chosen to swim against the tide and continue rewarding shareholders with dividend hikes.These stocks have a strong history of dividend growth, which portrays that they are primarily mature companies that are less susceptible to large swings in the market. Consequently, these stocks largely act as a hedge against economic or political uncertainty as well as stock market volatility and offer downside protection with their consistent increase in payouts.Additionally, these stocks have superior fundamentals that make dividend growth a quality and promising investment for the long term. These include a sustainable business model, a long track of profitability, rising cash flows, healthy liquidity, a strong balance sheet and some value characteristics. Further, a history of strong dividend growth indicates that a dividend increase is likely in the future.Let us dig deep into five such tech stocks to gauge the underlying metrics that reflect their inherent financial strengths.Motorola Solutions, Inc. MSI: Based in Chicago, IL, Motorola is a leading communications equipment manufacturer and has strong market positions in bar code scanning, wireless infrastructure gear and government communications. The company recently announced an 11% year-over-year hike in its quarterly dividend payout to 98 cents per share or $3.92 on an annualized basis.A steady dividend payout is part of the long-term strategy of Motorola to provide attractive risk-adjusted returns to its stockholders. In addition, healthy dividend increases at periodic intervals have been one of its strengths. Management further increased its share repurchase authorization by an additional $2 billion to $18 billion.Motorola is poised to gain from robust organic growth, disciplined capital deployment and strong demand across land mobile radio products, services and software. As the public safety market continues to embrace software offerings to enhance workflows, Motorola is able to sell cloud-first SaaS offerings in addition to on-premise solutions with ancillary implementation and managed services. The company is expanding its software offerings to provide solutions across the various segments of the public safety workflow.This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 9.9% and gained 21.1% over the past year. It delivered an earnings surprise of 6%, on average, in the trailing four quarters. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings for Motorola has been revised 5.4% upward over the past year.Qualcomm Incorporated QCOM: Headquartered in San Diego, CA, Qualcomm is one of the largest manufacturers of wireless chipsets based on baseband technology. It has increased its quarterly dividend payout to 80 cents per share or $3.20 on an annualized basis. The hike reflects the inherent financial strength of the company and the strong cash flow generated from continued focus on high-margin businesses and healthy execution of operating plans.Qualcomm generated $4,090 million of net cash from operating activities in the fiscal fourth quarter compared with $1,446 million a year ago, bringing the respective tallies for fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2022 to $11,299 million and $9,096 million.

The company recently hiked its quarterly dividend payout by about 16.7% to 35 cents per share or $1.40 on an annualized basis.

As of Sep 30, 2023, it had cash and cash equivalents of $79.3 million and generated $117.7 million cash from operating activities in the first nine months of 2023.The increasing proliferation of smartphones, wearables and tablets is driving the adoption of small-area OLEDs.

The company’s UniversalPHOLED phosphorescent OLED technology produces OLEDs that are four times more efficient than fluorescent OLEDs and significantly more efficient than current LCDs. This provides Universal Display with a competitive advantage over other OLED makers.This Zacks Rank #3 stock has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 16.4% and gained 68.7% over the past year.

The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed to a fresh record high, while the benchmark S&P 500 and growth-driven Nasdaq Composite have powered higher by 24% and 43%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis, as of the closing bell on Dec. 19."", 'Although the rally over the past eight weeks has been broad-based, it\'s the ""Magnificent Seven"" that have done most of the heavy lifting on Wall Street since the year began.', 'The Magnificent Seven are comprised of the seven largest publicly traded companies by market cap in the U.S.:', 'Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)', 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)', 'Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)', 'The reason the Magnificent Seven have outperformed so substantially this year is because of their respective impenetrable moats and/or competitive advantages.', 'Apple boasts the greatest capital-return program on the planet and is the leading provider of smartphones (by a mile!) in the U.S.', ""Microsoft's Windows still dominates desktop operating systems, while Azure is the global No. 2 in cloud infrastructure-service spending."", ""Alphabet's Google is practically a monopoly, with nearly 92% of worldwide internet search share in November."", ""Amazon's online marketplace brought in roughly $0.40 of every $1 spent in online retail sales in the U.S. in 2022."", ""Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) account for between 80% and 90% of the GPUs currently deployed in high-compute data centers."", 'Meta Platforms owns the world\'s top social media ""real estate"" (led by Facebook), and it drew in close to 4 billion monthly active users during the third quarter.', ""Tesla is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only EV pure play that's currently profitable."", ""The cutting-edge innovation and sustained dominance exhibited by these seven companies isn't lost on Wall Street or its analysts. Based on the high-water price targets issued by a select group of analysts, three Magnificent Seven stocks have upside ranging from 50% to 122% in 2024 (and beyond)."", 'Even though shares of semiconductor stock Nvidia have gained nearly 240% year to date, at least one Wall Street analyst sees triple-digit upside still to come.', ""According to Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities, Nvidia can reach $1,100 per share, which would represent a gain of 122% for the company's shareholders. If Mosesmann is correct, it would also add another $1.5 trillion to Nvidia's market cap."", ""It's absolutely no secret that the buzz surrounding Nvidia has to do with its ties to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Analysts at PwC have estimated that AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade. Nvidia is cementing itself as the infrastructure backbone of this close-to-$16 trillion opportunity."", ""Nvidia's A100 and H100 AI-driven GPUs could potentially top a 90% share in AI-accelerated data centers in 2024. Though chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity held the supply of A100 and H100 GPUs back throughout much of the current year, chip-fabrication giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has increased its CoWoS capacity and paved a path for Nvidia to meaningfully increase output in the new year."", ""However, Nvidia's newfound success may come with an ironic problem. You see, the bulk of Nvidia's data-center sales growth through the first nine months of its current fiscal year was driven by A100 and H100 scarcity and truly exceptional pricing power. As Nvidia ramps up production, and new competition enters the arena (ahem, Advanced Micro Devices), Nvidia is liable to lose most of its pricing power. In other words, Nvidia's gross margin may have already peaked."", ""Furthermore, there hasn't been a next-big-thing investment for three decades that didn't endure a period of unsustainable euphoria early in its ramping up -- and AI is unlikely to be the exception. Most businesses are still trying to figure out how to deploy AI solutions to their advantage. Using history as a guide, it's highly unlikely that Mosesmann's $1,100 price target for Nvidia is reached in 2024."", 'The second Magnificent Seven stock with mouthwatering upside, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is tech stock Microsoft.', ""Analyst Joel Fishbein of Truist Securities recently anointed the second-largest publicly traded company by market cap with a $600 price target over the next three years. Should Fishbein's forecast come to fruition, Microsoft's shares would increase by 61%, with the company adding almost $1.7 trillion in market cap."", ""It should come as no surprise that Microsoft's burgeoning investments in AI are the primary driver of Fishbein's lofty price target. Microsoft has invested billions into OpenAI, the company that introduced the world to ChatGPT one year ago. OpenAI also played a key role in the incorporation of AI into Microsoft's search engine, Bing."", ""Additionally, Microsoft was quick to introduce generative AI solutions to its cloud-infrastructure service customers via Azure. Generative AI solutions are particularly useful for businesses in that they can tailor marketing to specific customers, provide virtual agents/chatbots that can answer customer queries, and can even offer solutions for supply chain inefficiencies. It's no wonder Azure has been gaining ground in the cloud-infrastructure service space."", ""However, Microsoft's legacy segments are still playing a key role in its success. Though Windows isn't the growth driver it was 20 years ago, it's still the dominant global operating system for computers. The high margins and abundant cash flow Microsoft nets from its legacy operations provides the company with capital to take risks -- e.g., make acquisitions or invest aggressively in new trends, like AI."", ""Although Microsoft shouldn't have any trouble sustaining a low-double-digit growth rate, the company's stock presently appears fully priced for future success (29 times forward earnings). This makes Fishbein's $600 price target over the next three years a potential reach."", 'The third Magnificent Seven stock with abundant upside in 2024 (and potentially beyond) is e-commerce juggernaut, Amazon.', ""According to analyst Alex Haissl of Redburn Atlantic, the world's leading online retailer is expected to reach $230 per share. Should Haissl's forecast become reality in the new year, Amazon shares would increase by 50%, and its market cap would grow by close to $790 billion."", ""The likely catalyst behind Haissl's aggressive price target for Amazon is the company's fast-growing cloud-infrastructure services segment. Despite Azure gaining a bit of ground, Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the world's top cloud-infrastructure service provider by spending (31% share). Considering that enterprise cloud spending is still in its very early innings of expansion, there's reason to believe AWS can deliver significant operating cash-flow growth for Amazon in the years to come."", ""Amazon's other fast-growing ancillary segments provide another reason to be optimistic about its future. For instance, Amazon attracts more than 2 billion unique visitors to its site each month, which makes it one of the most visited sites globally. This makes the company a logical go-to for advertisers wanting to get their message(s) in front of motivated shoppers. It's the perfect recipe for strong ad-pricing power."", ""Likewise, Amazon surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021. The steady expansion of the company's e-commerce platform, coupled with it gaining the exclusive rights to Thursday Night Football, has likely pushed Prime's subscriber count meaningfully higher."", ""The final selling point for Amazon is the company's valuation. Even though its trailing-12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 81 is enough to make even the most aggressive growth investors cringe, its forward-year multiple-to-cash flow (14) is lower than at any point since becoming a publicly traded company. Among the Magnificent Seven stocks with the greatest upside potential in 2024 (and beyond), it's Amazon that's likeliest to reach its high-water price target."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

With broad management experience, including roles at Cigna and PepsiCo, he has plenty of experience with growing businesses.', ""Wentworth is in a tough position, however, given Walgreens' stock performance and the company's current struggles. Its retail locations are no longer getting a traffic boost from people seeking COVID-19 vaccinations. And in three of the past four quarters, Walgreens has posted an operating loss."", 'Walgreens is at a crossroads, and there are indications that the board is looking for significant changes. I fully expect that Wentworth will make some once he has had time to get a good grasp on the business and its operations.', 'In the press release announcing Wentworth\'s appointment, the focus was on his healthcare experience. Executive Chairman Stefano Pessina stated, ""We are confident he is the right person to lead WBA\'s next phase of growth into a customer-centric healthcare company.""', ""This sounds to me like something the leaders of a company in transition might say. But it appears evident that abandoning the healthcare strategy and the launch of primary clinics isn't on the agenda. That wouldn't appear probable with the hiring of Wentworth."", ""But that doesn't mean other moves aren't on the table, such as closing some locations, as well as cutting or stopping the dividend. According to Bloomberg News, the company is also considering getting rid of its U.K.-based Boots business, potentially by spinning it off with a public offering. In the past, Walgreen has contemplated selling the business, so it wouldn't come as a huge shock to investors."", ""A new CEO has the benefit of coming in fresh and not having to worry so much about the company's previous track record and performance, which can make it easier to announce a big change. I believe that management will cut the dividend to free up cash flow, and that the company will get leaner by either selling or spinning off Boots, or reducing the number of retail pharmacy locations it has in the U.S."", ""Whatever actions Wentworth takes, they will likely be aimed at improving free cash flow (which has been negative in two of the past four quarters) and the bottom line. The business simply can't continue expanding into healthcare, spending billions, while also being unprofitable and paying a dividend. At some point, something has to give, which is why I believe at least one big move is inevitable over the course of the next 12 months."", 'The good news for investors is that should Walgreens get back to posting consistent profits and positive free cash flow, that would help get the stock out of the gutter.', ""While there is reason for hope that Walgreens can improve its business over the next 12 months, until it happens, investors are still better off waiting on the sidelines.

Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex Second Quarter Fiscal 2024 earnings release. Joining me today is Bob Schrader, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast on the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'm going to start today with a brief update on the business highlights for the second quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Bob for a financial update and then, of course, we'll take your questions. We had solid results in the second quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year, with particularly strong performance in the PEO, mid-market HCM and retirement. Revenue for the first half was up 6% year-over-year, and our adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 10%, double digits. The demand for our HR technology advisory solutions remains strong as business leaders continue to face a very challenging small and midsized business environment. The tight labor market and rising healthcare and benefits costs are forcing many to rethink their HR and benefit strategies. And they can turn to Paychex as a trusted business partner in these times. As we sit here today, the selling season for our mid-market HCM and our PEO teams are in their final phases, and our insurance open enrollment is underway. All are going well and in line with our expectations. Our pipelines for these solutions are strong and up from this time last year. In the small business market, selling season is just ramping up. We still have a critical third quarter to go, both in terms of selling and delivering for our clients during year-end, but we are fully staffed and well positioned at this critical time of year. Our revenue retention remains above pre-pandemic levels as we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high-value clients. Client retention has improved over last year, and retention in our HR outsourcing solutions remains at record levels. I'd like to highlight the success specifically in our PEO business, which we've talked about on prior calls. It has continued to gain momentum with strong results during the first half of the fiscal year. We have seen a shift back towards the PEO offering, both outside and inside our client base. This shift in mix has a long-term positive impact on customer lifetime value on our business model, particularly as clients attach insurance benefits. We previously discussed actions we took to help the PEO recover after last year's challenges, including: one, redesigning our health offerings; second, leveraging AI to revamp our sales and marketing models and to identify and attract high-value prospects; three, putting more focus on upgrading existing HCM and ASO clients to the PEO model; and finally, improved sales execution. As mentioned earlier, our insurance enrollment is underway, and the tax rates are up after a challenging year last year. I want to specifically thank and congratulate our PEO team for all the hard work and success in the past year so far. The macro environment and labor environment continue to be challenging for small and midsized businesses. Our small business employment watch continues to show moderation in both job growth and wage inflation, which is indicative of a stable macro environment and that the actions taken by the Fed are having their desired impact. While we haven't seen any normal signs of a recession in our data, we started to see some softening in seasonal hiring in the quarter, particularly in our large client segments, including our HR outsourcing businesses, many of which typically add seasonal employees at this time of the year. SMBs are still challenged with access to capital, the high cost of capital, inflation and macro uncertainty. While we certainly don't see any signs of economic downturn, we are ready to take the required actions if such trends emerge. As one of the best operators in the business, we have demonstrated that we are able to respond and successfully navigate changes in any economic environment. I know that AI and related technology advancements remain a hot topic in our industry. As I've noted in past calls, AI at Paychex is nothing new. We have over hundreds of -- and growing models, AI models that are actively working in our business today designed to provide valuable insights fueled by our vast data assets. The exciting transformation that is now occurring around generative AI opens up the opportunity for us to bring AI solutions to our employees, so they can be more effective and efficient, and to our clients. We are actively investing in gen AI and exploring how it can be used to improve efficiency and the customer experience and provide actual insights to us and our clients to help them succeed. Currently, recently, we partnered with Visier, a global leader in people analytics and workforce solutions, to offer new benchmarking reports and AI-powered HR analytics solutions to our customers. This enhances our current reporting and analytics available in Paychex Flex and will perfectly complement our industry-leading HR advisory services. The partnership provides core HR and compensation analytics and compensation in salary benchmarking, an AI-driven model with benchmarks against 750 million market data points. This offering, in addition to our AI-driven retention insight solution that we launched over a year ago, is just the beginning of how we will leverage AI to help businesses succeed. Partnerships with Visier, like our recruiting and onboarding partnership with Indeed, is another example of how Paychex is bringing together the power of partnerships, our large data assets and integration to improve the customer experience and deliver real value and business outcomes for our clients. We are also pleased that for the seventh consecutive year, we have been positioned in the leader quadrant as part of the NelsonHall 2023 Vendor Evaluation report for payroll service providers. This provides further evidence of our leadership position based on our robust technology and customer support. We're also very proud to be recognized in the Sapient Insights Group Voice of the Customer Top 5 Vendor Survey for 2023 and 2024, receiving top 5 ratings in six categories spanning payroll, HR, time and attendance, learning and performance. And really, what I'm most proud of is that the Sapient report is actually based on actual voices of our customers and customers from across the competitors, which demonstrates our leadership position across the industry. As we head into selling season in calendar year-end, I'm confident in our global Paychex team and that they will constantly deliver and consistently deliver for our clients. We remain driven to be the trusted partner for small and midsized businesses that deliver industry-leading HCM technology and advisory solutions that help our clients succeed. I'll now turn it over to Bob to give you a brief update on our financial results in the quarter. Bob?"", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Thanks, Johnny, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events that [pertain] involve some level of risk. I'll refer you to our customer disclosures in our press release as well as our Investor Relations presentation that should be on our website. I will start by providing a summary of our second quarter financial results. Total revenue for the quarter increased 6% to $1.3 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 4% to $931 million. That was primarily driven by growth in a number of our clients served across our suite of HCM solutions, price realization and increased product penetration and growth in ancillary services. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 8% to $296 million. That was driven primarily by higher revenue per client, including higher insurance revenues and average worksite employees. As John mentioned, our PEO saw continued momentum in sales activity and medical plan purchase and volumes during the second quarter. Interest on funds held for clients increased 44% to $31 million. That was primarily due to higher average interest rates. Total expenses increased 5% to $752 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher compensation costs, PEO direct insurance costs and continued investments in sales, marketing and technology. Operating income increased 7% to $506 million for the quarter with an operating margin of 40.2%. That's a 50 basis point expansion over the prior year period. And both diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $1.08 per share. I will now quickly touch on the results for the first 6 months of the year. Total revenue grew 6% to $2.5 billion. Management Solutions revenue in the first half of the year increased 5% to $1.9 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions was up 7% to $593 million. And interest on funds held for clients increased 62% to $64 million. Our total expenses for the first half of the year were up 5% to $1.5 billion. And our operating margins for the first 6 months were 41%, and that was a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 10% to $2.24 and $2.23, respectively. I'll take you through a quick overview of the company's financial position. As you all know, we maintain a strong financial position with high-quality cash flows and earnings. Our balance for cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments was more than $1.4 billion, and our total borrowings were approximately $812 million as of the end of November. Cash flow for operations for the first 6 months of the year were $1 billion, and that's up 40% compared to the same period last year. This was primarily driven by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. Do want to call out, similar to last quarter, there are some timing differences there based on where the quarter ended, ended on a collection date that's driving higher operating cash flows. That's why you see the 40% level. That will moderate as we move through the year. We returned a total of $811 million to shareholders during the first 6 months. That includes $642 million of dividends and $169 million of share repurchases. And our 12-month rolling return on equity remained strong at 47%. I'll now turn to our guidance for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. We've raised guidance on certain measures based on performance this past quarter. For other measures, I will also provide some color on where we now expect to be within the ranges, and certainly, we can provide some more detail when we get to the Q&A. The outlook assumes the current macro and competitive environment, which has some uncertainty, particularly as it relates to future interest rate changes in the economy. So our current outlook is as follows: Management Solutions is unchanged, with growth in the range of 5% to 6%, although we do anticipate it will now be at the low end of the range. PEO and Insurance Solutions is now expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%, that's up from our previous guidance, which was 6% to 9% expectation. Interest on funds held for clients has not changed. We still expect that to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%, but we now expect it to be more in the middle of the range. I know last quarter, we thought that might be a bit stronger. We now expect the total revenue guidance to be more aligned with our original guidance of 6% to 7%. Operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%, although we now anticipate that we'll probably be towards the upper end of that range. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $35 million to $40 million, and that's raised from our previous guidance of $30 million to $35 million. No change to the effective income tax rate. We still expect that to be between 24% and 25%. And then adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. So we raised that last quarter to 9% to 11%, just based on what we're seeing, we expect that to be a bit stronger, and we're raising that guidance to 10% to 11%. Now I'm going to turn to the third quarter to give you a little color on the third quarter. We are currently anticipating total revenue growth for the third quarter to be in the range of 5% to 6% and operating margins to be in the range of 44% to 45%. As it stands right now, we would expect to pretty much be right in the middle of those two ranges. And I'd like to remind everyone that we've talked about this in the past, that ERTC becomes a headwind in the back half of the year. If I go back and look over the last 2.5 years that we've been selling ERTC, Q3 of last year was the largest quarter that we had with ERTC. And so that's a bit more of a headwind in Q3 than Q4, but will be a headwind in the back half of the year. Of course, all of this is based on our current assumptions, which are subject to change. We'll come back and update you again on the third quarter call. As I mentioned, our investor slides are posted on the website, so I'll refer you there for additional information. And with that, I will turn it back over to John."", 'John B. Gibson', 'Okay. Thank you, Bob. We will now open it up -- the call for questions. Chelsea?', 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from Kevin McVeigh with UBS.', 'Kevin Damien McVeigh', ""And congratulations as you close out the year. John, Bob and I want to thank Efrain, because I think this is the last quarter Efrain will be on the call, too. So John or Bob, I think you talked about revenue retention at record levels and client retention improving. Can you maybe dimensionalize that a little bit? And -- because it feels like that's getting a little bit better, but the revenue may be more the middle of the range. So what's driving the improvement? And then kind of maybe just the tweak on the revenue expectations overall?"", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. Kevin, I'll start off on retention, and we can talk a little bit about the revenue expectations. Bob will add some color on that, and then I'll jump in.Look, we continue to be very pleased with where we are on revenue retention. I think as we've continually talked about, we've really been highly focused on having an impact in those critical areas where it counts, and that's our high-value segments, and that's what we've seen. Our HR outsourcing business, both ASO and PEO, record levels of retention, and we're very pleased with that. Client retention across the business was actually better in the first half of this fiscal year than it was last fiscal year, and that's really attributable to the team's great job of really managing the controllables. We're continuing to see on the lower end of the market, bankruptcies out of businesses and noncontrollable losses being higher year-over-year. That's not surprising to me when you see the level of business starts that we've seen during the COVID period really at elevated levels. And we just know a lot of those small companies that start out 2 years ago, most of those have trouble financially. And so overall, revenue retention continues to be at pre-pandemic levels, which I would remind you, was at near historic highs for the company."", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes, Kevin, I'll just add on the guide. As you guys remember, at the end of Q1, I think where we ended the quarter, we had said we expected to be towards the high end of the range. I think there were a couple of reasons at that time why we felt confident in saying that. I would say, one, the positive trends that we were seeing in the PEO business, I think we wanted to wait another quarter before we raised the PEO guidance. But we definitely saw some positive trends really going back to the end of last year. That continued into Q1. I'd say that gave us a little bit of confidence. And as you guys know, we did do a small acquisition at the end of Q1. Not a big contributor to growth, but I think those two things combined really gave us a bit of confidence that we thought we might be towards the upper end of the range. I'd say as we got through Q2, the one thing that I'll highlight -- I think John made reference to it -- although we didn't have big growth assumptions in the plan related to employment growth, particularly in our larger employee sizes across both Management Solutions and the PEO, we typically get some seasonal hiring. We expected to see some growth there. That didn't materialize to the level that we expected and certainly what we've seen in the past. And so that's given us a little bit of pause. And as I mentioned, that was across both categories, Management Solutions, and PEO, insurance. The PEO insurance for the most part, they've been able to outrun that, I would say, just given the strength of the business. John talked about the strong demand there. And some of the action plans that we've taken have really paid off there. But on the Management Solutions side, it's been a little bit of a headwind. And that's kind of what you see in the quarter as well as kind of the fine-tuning of the guidance range that I just provided."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.', 'Andrew Owen Nicholas', ""Really strong quarter on the PEO front. I wanted to ask about pricing dynamics there. And in health insurance, more specifically, we've heard from some competitors within the space that there are certain players that are being more aggressive on the health side during this year's renewal cycle. I'm just kind of wondering if you've seen that, how Paychex is navigating that environment, stacking up in terms of rate increases relative to those peers? And maybe just how you're faring broadly on the pricing side?"", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. So thanks for the question, Andrew. I'll say this. The PEO, you can tell by the growth numbers continued to improve as the year has gone on. And I would tell you that our pipeline is very strong in comparison to last year. So whatever the competitors are doing, our value proposition is resonating. I can assure you that we're not using cheap health as a [vast] part of the value proposition. So we go at it more as a comprehensive HR outsourcing value proposition. And if clients are looking for cheap health, they're probably -- we're probably not engaging in that conversation very long. We have the capability, as you know, to also leverage our insurance agency within our PEO as well. But very pleased with where we are on the -- with the PEO right now, very strong performance. The pipeline is solid. We are in the final stages, as you can imagine. That in the mid-market, as you know, typically, the selling season as much earlier, it's pretty much in the final innings. And both pipelines, I would say for the PEO, are very, very strong, both in terms of insurance attachment and in terms of sales."", 'Andrew Owen Nicholas', ""Great. And if you don't mind, just a follow-up on ERTC. It sounds like that's trending towards your expectation that the comp in the fiscal third quarter is a bit tougher. Just wanted to confirm that. And then also, it looks like the IRS has taken a stance with respect to ERTC and potentially making PEOs liable for that. Just wondering if that presents any risk or how you're kind of thinking about that dynamic in that part of the business?"", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes. I'll start on just kind of the financials. I'd say, for the most part, ERTC, we finally got it right from a forecasting standpoint after 3 years. It's been a little challenging to forecast that. But for the most part, it has lined up with our expectation. Most of that was assumed to be in the front half of the year. That's behind us. There still is a little bit in the back half of the year. But for the most part, it has lined up. I've gotten this question a lot. I promised to provide an update on ERTC. So I'm going to stick to my word, which was essentially, we had said prior that we expected it to be a slight tailwind in the front half of the year. That's where the front half landed. It was a slight tailwind. We expected it to be a headwind in the back half of the year. It will be a headwind in the back half of the year. But I wanted to provide a little bit more color, and you guys can kind of do the math and back into it. But on a full year basis, with the tailwind in the front half and the headwind in the back half, we would expect it to be about a 1% headwind on a full year basis to growth. And then I don't know, John, do you want to address the PEO?"", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. Yes. I think relative to your question on the PEO and ERTC and the IRS, it stands on it. I would say the IRS has been trying to look for bad actors in both parts of that equation and tighten rules. As you can imagine, we've been very diligent with our compliance teams and setting up our process. In fact, we were a little slower going out on the ERTC product in the PEO because we wanted to work through all of those compliance and the way we approach the contracting with our clients for that services. So I would tell you, Andrew, we feel very good about our position and where we are in terms of managing that risk."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.', 'Ramsey Clark El-Assal', ""I had a follow-up on ERTC. It strikes me that there's a kind of a backlog building, right, as they paused processing. So is this the type of thing that we should think about? Yes, it's a headwind in the back half of the year. But eventually, as the IRS begins processing again, that revenue might start to flow again in the future. Is it sort of more of a shift of revenue into the future? And I know it's complicated and they're rolling in some deadlines in '24 -- calendar '24. So I was just curious how we should -- how you're thinking about that ERTC revenue, not just for the following quarters, but maybe a little bit beyond that?"", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', 'Yes. Not really, Randy, because what we\'re basically doing is we\'re amending the returns and filing the submissions for our clients, which the IRS continues to accept. And so we\'re recognizing the revenue. And as we do that and they\'re still accepting submissions. So there\'s really not a timing shift there. The change that the IRS made at the end of Q1 really has impacted our ability to continue to go into our base and sell it, really hasn\'t impacted our forecast from a revenue standpoint. The big difference is that you have the deadline, you\'re approaching a deadline here at the end of this fiscal year. And we\'re 3 years into it. And we\'ve been through our base and really have identified all the clients that are qualified for the opportunity. We\'ve talked to them. And if we haven\'t talked to them, you can turn on the radio Everyone else has talked to them. So it\'s just, ""Hey, we\'re 3 years into it."" And I think most small businesses that qualified for this benefit have taken advantage of the opportunity. And there may be some a little bit that flows into next year, but nothing of significance. I\'m hoping at some point in time, I can stop talking about ERTC, but there\'s really no timing shift there related to what the IRS did.', 'Ramsey Clark El-Assal', ""Great. That's very helpful. And a follow-up, SECURE Act 2.0, is that in any of your conversations in the selling season, give us kind of your latest view about how that opportunity is framing up for Paychex?"", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. I think we highlighted and mentioned, first half 401(k), a very solid continued performance. So we're very pleased with that offering. I think as you know, we probably go out to the market with the most comprehensive retirement offerings for small businesses, anywhere from simple IRAs to our step plans that we are one of the largest providers, if not the largest provider of pet plans.So very pleased with that. It is part of our selling season campaign. I think, as I said, one of the things we've learned a lot about the retirement business from some of the state mandates, I continue to try to pound this in, is this is one of the things you still have a lot of education to do, for the small business owner. Even though there's a lot of benefits to it, there are costs involved, there's compliance issues. And so this is not something that people just sign up for. So there's a lot of education and pre-marketing that has to be done, but we're certainly leveraging the SECURE Act as a means to entice clients into a conversation and are finding it successful once we do and getting them to understand the benefits of our offerings."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen.', 'Bryan C. Bergin', ""So I wanted to start on Management Solutions. The light seasonal hiring that you've called out here that drives the weaker view, can you just dig in more on that client profile? And is this more so a pullback in demand for employees or issues in the hiring? So I'm curious what you might be seeing as it relates to clients' talent acquisition funnels and job openings, background checks, things like that."", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes, Bryan. It's a good -- that's a very good question, very insightful question because we're trying to get under that as well. Here's what I'll tell you. It is a very challenging environment for small and midsized businesses. I think they are still challenged, and we're seeing it in our HR advising, they're still challenged with a very challenging labor market in terms of finding qualified workers. I always leave it at that. So I think that's certainly part of the issue. I think they're -- certainly with the high cost of capital, also with lower access to capital, I think they're being very cautious about investing for growth. So they're trying to figure out how do I do more for less. So there may be a little bit of a hesitancy. At the same time, while we hear our people want to hire qualified people. And I think they had some experience, a little small group that I was talking to where what they found was they were paying higher rates for less qualified people. And then our HR matters that we were dealing with, disciplinary issues, no shows, all these types of issues, I think a lot of business owners are saying, if I can't hire a qualified person, I may be better off to try to figure out how I can use the people I have to get there. So I just -- I read that as a macro environment because we're not seeing anything in our data that would say mass downsizings or reductions. That's not what we're seeing. I think in the higher-end enterprise side, you are seeing rightsizing going on in the business. When you get into the mid-market, really, what we're seeing is a little more choppiness in hiring across various industries. And particularly, it's mostly upmarket and what I would say where we've typically seen seasonal hiring. That's where we did not see that at the rates that we historically have seen. Now what's interesting about that, I'll point out, is when you see that -- when I see the impressive results of our PEO team -- remember, a lot of our PEO clients are in Florida, which, as you can imagine, is a pretty seasonal state this time of year. So the growth numbers you're seeing there were -- with a headwind of not having as much seasonal hiring. We saw the similar thing in our ASO business, which is in Managed Solutions and to a lesser extent, in our HCM mid-market business. So I would say more choppiness there. In the small market, it's more of the same moderation that you see in our index, really not what I would say downsizing or clients taking actions from an employment perspective, but more of either they can't find people to fill the spots they want or they're being hesitant on adding additional headcount at this time. So I don't know if that gives you some additional color."", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Bryan, I just want to add a little bit. You didn't specifically ask this, but just as your comment as it relates to weaker Management Solutions. The other part of that beyond the softer hiring versus what we expected, the other part of that has to do with the strong performance in PEO as well. We talked to you guys about the PEO business. We've had a lot of questions on that and our ability to kind of reaccelerate growth there. And one of the strategies there was that we knew the ASO was really strong last year. We had put a plan together to really go back inside of the base, leverage our data, leverage our AI models, really look at the clients that we thought would be good PEO fits. And we've been executing on that plan over the last 6 months, and that has actually been a little bit better than what we anticipated. So now the pendulum has swung back a little bit the other way. We probably should just put these two businesses together in one category. It would make my -- and John's job much easier. But we've had a lot of success with PEO. I think that's why you see the rate there. And that is impacting to some extent, to use your word, the little bit weaker performance in Management Solutions."", 'Bryan C. Bergin', ""Okay. That's all helpful color. And I fully understand the ASO versus kind of PEO shift there. And maybe just a follow-up here on the PEO. Can you just dig in a bit more around the expectations of at-risk health insurance attachment participation rates as you go towards the 1/1 go-live period? And specifically, did PEO bookings accelerate in the quarter relative to last quarter?"", 'John B. Gibson', ""Well, let me take the last one first. Yes, I would tell you that -- we talked about the PEO in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year. We told you about many of the changes we were making across that business. We began to see acceleration there. It accelerated further in the first quarter, and it continued in the second quarter. And it continued both outside the base as well as inside the base. So as Bob pointed out, this ASO to PEO conversion. So we've seen a very healthy pipeline. And I would say not only in the PEO, also in our mid-market. So when you look at the two businesses, that are -- that -- in summary, if you -- if we're sitting here today in the selling season in our mid-market HCM and PEO, they're well underway. They're really in the final stages. Our pipeline was very strong. And then the enrollment of the insurance, it was very strong as well. I would tell you that we're getting back in line to where we've been historically. If you remember, we had a little degradation. And actually, what we saw inside the existing customer base was an increase, I would say, maybe single-digit increase in penetration similar to last year. We had some employees in it sign up for plans. We did some things on changing our plan lineup. We did some things in the way we're doing education and open enrollment there. And the team has done a great job of improving our attach rate within the existing client base as well during this enrollment."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.', 'Jason Alan Kupferberg', ""I wanted to ask a follow-up just on Management Solutions. I mean, I know we're talking about the lower end of the 5% to 6% for the year. So you basically need to maintain the 5% growth rate that you saw in the first half, in the second half, despite the fact you're lapping ERTC and it sounds like maybe the tone on overall health of SMBs is downticking a little bit. So just wanted to get your perspective on the visibility of Paychex's ability to maintain that 5% growth in the second half given some of those moving parts out there?"", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes. I mean, I can start and then John can add on. I mean, obviously, there is the headwind there with ERTC, but there's other areas of the business. And although ASO, we had some of the hiring challenges that John referenced as well as better PEO performance, ASO still continues to be a strong contributor to growth, and we expect that to continue to be the case in the back half of the year.We talked about retirement. That has been a really strong driver of growth for us and just really increased product penetration. We expect that to continue into the back half of the year, Jason. That will offset, to some extent, some of the ERTC headwind. And again, we did do a small acquisition. It's not a huge contributor to growth on -- on a full year basis. But again, that will help mitigate some of that headwind as we move into the back half of the year. And when we kind of put all those things together, we would expect Management Solutions to be in a similar growth rate in the back half of the year than the first half -- or same as the first half."", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. Jason, I just think the other thing I would add on commentary, relative to the SMB market, we're not even in really the key selling season. So we're just in the selling season. That's just beginning to -- to kick off, and we have a lot of execution during January, as you know, to go out in the marketplace. So that's just starting. So the areas where we are nearly complete with the selling season, the mid-market, the PEO, the high end of ASO, those pipelines are full, much better than last year. And really in that small market, we're just beginning to enter the selling season with a lot of execution to go in the next 60 days."", 'Jason Alan Kupferberg', ""Okay. That's good color. I know you talked about how you're thinking about overall revenue growth for Q3 versus Q4, but can you just parse out maybe your segment level growth expectations for Q3 versus Q4, just so we get our models tuned properly? Thank you, guys. Have a great holiday."", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes, I'm just -- I'm taking a look at that, Jason. Obviously, the Management Solutions will probably be a bit lower in Q3 than Q4 because of the -- the headwinds that we talked about being greater with ERTC in Q3. And then the PEO in insurance, those growth rates are going to be similar to where they were in Q2. And hopefully, when you look at the full year guidance, the guide that I gave you on Q3, you can kind of do the math and should get you close."", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. The other thing, Jay, I just think, again, on color of this -- Bob said that this geography shifting that we have going over last year counter rotated the ASO from the PEO offering when we're offering both. There's more movement that way. So we're talking geography. Now we're talking the geography move from Management Solutions to PEO insurance because it's tilted kind of the other way.The other thing that I would remind everybody, which is a little different on the ASO to PEO conversions. There's not a selling season for that. We do those migrations all year long. And so we continue to see good traction there, and we don't intend to slow that down. There's no reason to -- it's higher revenue, it's a higher lifetime value in our overall model. So again, just relative to forecasting between the two areas as well doing, Bob's got a model, he'll go through it with you. But the caveat I always have that I'll say that geography thing is if we can continue to move more of our clients from HCM and ASO to PEO in the back half of the year, we'll do that."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Peter Christiansen with Citi.', 'Peter Corwin Christiansen', ""Thanks for the question. Nice execution here. John, Bob, I was just hoping if you could talk a little bit about balance of trade. Any trends that you're noticing, particularly in the Management Solutions area? And then -- and John, you also mentioned AI playing a part in the sales role. Just wondering if you could dig a little bit into that and give us a sense of where you're making headway on that front? Appreciate the commentary. Happy holidays."", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. Thank you very much. No, look, I think relative to across the platforms in the mid-market, very pleased with the growth we have there. We've talked about the PEO already, very happy with where we are there. As I look across the small business -- it's a competitive market. I wouldn't say there's any major changes. And I would say I've talked about on the last call, our balance of trade metrics continue to look solid. I always say we're entering the selling season, and the next 60 days is about -- is all about that, and it's a competitive market. So we'll see. But as we sit here today, the known knowns -- very happy with our progress, upmarket in the mid-market HCM, very pleased with where we are on PEO, upper end of the ASO market. And then as I said, as we sit here today, I'm pleased with our balance of trade in the other areas. There was another question -- I missed something..."", 'Peter Corwin Christiansen', 'On the AI front, I think you mentioned it.', 'John B. Gibson', ""Oh, yes. I can't believe I passed up an opportunity to talk about AI. Look, AI is -- I will tell you, we've been doing a lot around this for decades. And now it's kind of out there in the public domain, but it's really quite amazing. So let's talk about on the sales side, we talk about on the PEO side. We're using it in our underwriting. We're using it in our targeting and we're using it in the mining of our base. The productivity lift that we get in terms of being able to understand where we can add value -- you're almost getting to the point where you almost like have a pre-proposal because you almost know the client is going to be -- is going to like what they see. So we're doing a lot of things there using AI models and our data models there.Doing a lot of this -- we talked a bit about pricing. And one of the things we now have is we have all of our major sales teams on one common platform in terms of proposal, proposal management and pricing management. And we're actually building AI models, started to use that in the mid-market that actually then gives our sales reps in real time based upon numerous factors, what price and what level of discounting we would allow for a particular client based upon the value of the client, based on the competitive set, et cetera. And that's actually allowing us to maximize both volume and rate. And we're going to continue to refine those models and expand those across the teams. But what we're getting from a sales productivity perspective, what we're getting in terms of a marketing targeting perspective, what we're getting in terms of the ability to set the right price and rate to get the biggest competitive advantage, all of those things are pretty impressive. Then on top of that, we're actually using it for analytics. We're actually taking and using voice analytics on the conversations we're having with prospects and in real time, able to give coaching to our sales teams relative to what phrases are working, what messages are working, and we can dynamically change those things on the fly with our marketing message and sales scripts accordingly. So just a ton of very interesting things that we're doing. It was interesting as a lot of these changes to our go-to-market, we actually started piloting in the PEO back in the second half of the last quarter when we were having some challenges. We thought that was the best place to start and to see if we could get some lift. And some of what we've seen in the PEO, I think is a direct result of some of these tactics."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.', 'Kartik Mehta', ""You talked a little bit -- John, you talked about -- a little bit about the key selling season, obviously, in the SMB. And I'm wondering if you've seen any kind of change in price competition or if you're seeing anything that is a little different this time than last year?"", 'John B. Gibson', ""Kartik, look, I don't -- look, it's a competitive market, and it has been as long as I've been in the industry, 27 years. So look, I think there's all kinds of tricks. There's all kinds of market and we're even using them. The fact of the matter is I think there's a lot of offers out there when you get under the details of how long you have to be there, what are the strings attached. Really what it is, it's basic, it's the same kind of environment in terms of -- of discounting. It is very aggressive. But I would say this. I mean, look, we continue to see that we have price value and pricing pressure -- pricing power, both within our base and in the market. And that was very high in the last 2 years. I think we have been very able with the PPP and the ERTC to be able to really command very strong pricing power. That being said, we've done it for decades. I mean, we're not the lowest cost provider out there, and haven't been for decades. And I think what you see is when you look at our retention levels with our existing clients at record highs, I think that says something about the value proposition. At the end of the day, I think small, medium-sized business owners buy on value, not necessarily on price. So we're going to be competitive. We're going to meet people where they are head to head, but we're not going to be stupid. And you can see that we're being competitive, we're winning where we've been in combat in the market. We've got a good pipeline and a good track record of success. And as you can tell from our margins, we're not giving away the store."", 'Kartik Mehta', ""And then, Bob, just on the Management Solutions and you're talking about the seasonal employees. Is that just -- if we kind of -- kind of consolidate all that, is it just a matter of your pays per control expectations were X, but they came in a little bit less because of what you're seeing?"", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes. I'd say it's more than that, Kartik, because as we've talked about on a full year basis, we had some moderate expectations for clients adding employees. It wasn't a big driver of growth overall, as I mentioned, across both Management Solutions and PEO, that was a little bit softer. But what we're really seeing is not on the low end of the market. It's with our larger size clients, particularly in those ASO and PEO models. They're bigger client sizes, and we typically get some seasonal hiring. We get it every year. We had some assumptions around what that would look like in Q2, and that hasn't materialized to the level of our assumption or what we've seen in prior years. So it's really -- it is across the board. It's a little bit softer than what we anticipated. But to John's point earlier, it's not that small businesses are getting rid of employees, they're just not adding to the level that we assumed in the plan."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies.', 'Samad Saleem Samana', 'Maybe just stepping back. Since the last time you guys reported, the company has put out midterm financial goals. And I was wondering if maybe you could just provide us some context on the assumptions in that upper single-digit growth target for revenue, especially as we think about employment may be peaking, and rates doing what they are, just what was in that assumption, especially given that it was put out there between the last time you guys reported? And now -- just -- maybe help us understand what the building blocks are?', 'John B. Gibson', 'Yes.', 'Robert Lewis Schrader', 'You want me...', 'John B. Gibson', 'Go ahead.', 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes, Samad. I've gotten this question a lot. I think if you look back at -- we've talked about this. I've talked about it with many of you on this question specifically. But if you look at what we've done from a revenue growth, whether it's over the last 5 years or 10 years, it's well within the range of that midterm guidance that we gave. I would also say the guidance that we're providing this year, at least the way I think about it is well within that range as well. And as you know, better than anyone, we have a way we go about delivering that growth. It's a mix of client base growth. And then I would say that we would assume that to be similar with past performance. One thing that we're really good at is getting a larger share of wallet out of our client base with our -- particularly with our higher value solutions, ASO, PEO, retirement. We still think there's a lot of opportunity inside the base. When you look at a lot of those key solutions, the penetration rates are fairly low. And so we believe we have a lot of opportunity to continue to drive growth there. As John mentioned, we have pricing power, right? We deliver a strong value proposition and our expectation is that, hey, we might not be capturing price at the level that we did over the last couple of years where inflation was, but we believe we have a strong value proposition that is going to enable us to continue to capture price in the future. And I think when you put all that together, I'd say the other component of it, when you look back historically as we have used M&A as a way to drive growth in the business, and that has been part of our growth formula. It's part of what we've delivered over the last 5 and 10 years. And we expect that we'll continue to look for opportunities, and that will be part of our growth in the future. So when you kind of put that all together, that gives us confidence that we can continue to deliver in that upper single-digit level. It's not going to be -- it will vary year by year, but for the most part, we expect to be in that range."", 'Samad Saleem Samana', 'Understood. And then maybe just a follow-up, based on the trends that you guys have called out so far or what you observed in this most recent quarter, how should we think about maybe your own near-term hiring plans for quota-carrying sales reps or just in your own sales organization? Any change to that plan based on what you just observed in the prior quarter?', 'John B. Gibson', ""No. We're fully staffed, and our intent is to continue to grow sales. Look, the business starts are up. We feel like the opportunity in the marketplace is strong. Now I will tell you the thing we are trying to balance is the productivity gains that we can get out of some of the go-to-market strategies. As I said, we did some testing words in the PEO that showed some really good lift. And so quite frankly, I think we're going to apply those in the mid-market and the upper end of the SMB market. And I think those could also be a lift as well. But we have no plans of pulling back on investing in growth."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.', 'Bryan Connell Keane', 'Just a couple of clarifications from me. When you talked about SMBs investing for growth, hesitation, some hesitation there. Does that impact their willingness to buy ancillary services and maybe has impacted the management services growth as well?', 'John B. Gibson', ""We've really not seen that, Bryan. I think what we see is probably in the case of -- and I'll just use an example, [let's take] an example. You may have a very good -- a business owner has opened a couple of franchises, doing very, very well financially, and probably could justify adding another franchise store somewhere. But the cost of capital, access to capital is constrained, and they're holding back on doing that because the hurdle rate just can't be met. So that's more what I see than people pulling back and saying that I don't need that. Again, most of the time, when you look at our products and the services that we're offering, they're either driving efficiency or they're helping them retain and attract our quality employees, either by enhancing their benefits or by having an HCM solution. So I kind of view that most of our clients that are looking at our services understands the value of the products and services and believe that they're actually going to help their business be more successful. And so I don't think they always view it as an expense line item, if you know what I mean."", 'Bryan Connell Keane', 'Got it. Got it. And then the other clarification I had is, the shift to ASO to PEO, did that surprise you guys? Or was that all part of the plan and pretty typical?', 'John B. Gibson', ""No. I mean, it's something we've always historically done. What I would say is that it turned out better than we expected. Now let's keep in mind that last year, when we're out in the market with the PEO and ASO offering, we saw a tilt towards -- we had great HR outsourcing sales last year. We have great HR outsourcing sales. This year, they're just in different locations on the reporting structure. And so last year, we knew we had a lot of clients that we would have typically seen be great candidates for PEO. And they, for whatever reason, went to the ASO offering. And we said in the calls, we felt like that would be a good opportunity to go back to them once they've experienced our human capital management system, the benefits of our HR advisory solutions and our HRG to go back and kind of reintroduce them to the comprehensive outsourcing of the PEO model. That's exactly what we did. And so we had a bigger group of clients inside the base because of the success of ASO last year to go in mind. And then the other point that I said, what we're doing in terms of analytics to be able to identify clients that we have a high degree of certainty that they're going to benefit from the co-employment relationship that a PEO provides. And that's enabling us to what I would say, a little bit better cherrypick inside our vast customer base, who we should go after."", 'Bryan Connell Keane', ""Got it. That's helpful. And then just a quick one for Bob. Just to quantify the small acquisition, does that add about 1 to 2 points of revenue for third quarter? Or how do we think about that?"", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""No. It's small. I don't have the exact number, Bryan. On a full year basis, we said it's not a material contributor to revenue growth at all. I mean, way less than 1%. I don't have the split in front of me by quarter."", 'Bryan Connell Keane', 'Yes, I was just thinking maybe you could offset some of the ETRC.', 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""I mean it certainly is -- and that's assumed in the guide, and it certainly is offsetting it. But ERTC was so large in the back half of last year, particularly in Q3. Unfortunately, it comes nowhere near close enough to offset the full thing. But it does minimize it a little bit, the headwind."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.', 'James Eugene Faucette', ""Just a couple of quick follow-up questions. In terms of back to this point on seasonal hiring maybe being a little bit weaker, I'm just wondering, from your perspective, if there's been any impact or truth even before out to this narrative that we've heard a lot around labor hoarding and that smaller businesses, in particular, were keeping people on payroll or employed that they maybe otherwise wouldn't have just because they were concerned about shortages? And just wondering if you've seen any evidence of that actually in your customers and if that could be impacting the seasonal hiring at all?"", 'John B. Gibson', ""Well, James, I actually would say in the small business, it's not been hoarding at all. It's been a deficit. Now to be fair, in our index, which we follow very closely -- and I've reported a lot on this, small businesses, probably 9 months ago, kind of got back to a level playing field. I think where you saw hoarding was more in the upper end in enterprise side of the space. I think you saw that. Now -- so that's where I think you saw hoarding and hiring of people maybe they didn't even need. And the sets where you've seen some of these bigger downsizing. I think to the point you may be making is I do think that small and midsized business owners were reluctant to change employees out. And because we're trying a lot of focus on retention. That's why we launched the Retention Insights AI offering over a year ago because small business owners want to keep their good employees. I do think now that small business owners are trying to make sure that they have high-quality workforces. And that's what we see them talking to our HR generalists about is really more about how do I weed and feed my employee base? I maybe don't have the employee base that I wanted because I was kind of forced to hire some people 2 years ago when it was hard to find people. Now there's more opportunity to upskill my workforce. That's kind of what we're seeing in the low end. I wouldn't say any hoarding."", 'James Eugene Faucette', ""Okay. Got it. I just wanted to make sure that I was interpreting that correctly. And then you mentioned that we still are in a period of strong business starts. What about on the other end? I think there had been this viewed over -- in the economy generally that we weren't seeing failure rates or out of business rates get back to pre-pandemic levels yet, but can you just give us an update on what kind of out of business levels we're seeing? And -- and how much -- and particularly in the context of continued strong business starts, I'm just wondering on that component of the customer set."", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. I would tell you that bankruptcies are up and have been on the rise probably over the last year. You're still seeing births outpacing deaths. And now deaths typically report a little lag. I would just tell you in our data that bankruptcies continue to accelerate this year over last year in terms of out of business reasons. Again, what I always want to warn people here because I think people read into that data, other concerns on a macro basis, I don't view it that way. The fact of the matter is we had such high levels of new business births 2 years ago during the pandemic, that if you just do the math of survivability rates of those businesses, that -- most of them are gone after 5 years. And 50% of them are gone in the first 2 years. So what you're seeing is that shedding of that big bulk that started 2 years ago. The first group of those are going out of business. And so I think it's not a sign that there's an abnormal level of bankruptcies given the level of business starts that we had over the last 3 years, if that makes sense. Did I say that properly?"", 'James Eugene Faucette', ""It does -- Yes, I just -- on that point, so clearly, bankruptcies have been rising, but have they -- in your customer sets, have they surpassed pre-COVID levels? Or not yet? Or -- and it sounds like given that large number of births, we probably should expect them to surpass pre-COVID levels at some point if they haven't, right?"", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. I -- I would let me here -- because -- what I would tell you is bankruptcies are definitely up and have surpassed the fiscal year '20 levels, which is just a (inaudible) pandemic."", 'James Eugene Faucette', 'Got it.', 'John B. Gibson', 'And just a mark in the second quarter.', 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Mark Marcon with Baird.', 'Mark Steven Marcon', ""So on Management Solutions, John and Bob, you started off by talking about the upper -- the mid and upper end being a little bit stronger and seeing good performance there. I'm wondering, to what extent is that being driven by some of the new tools that you've recently introduced? In other words -- and what are you seeing just in terms of the strength dissecting between new logos versus further upsells into the existing client base?"", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes. I mean, as John mentioned, I think we've seen a lot of strength in the mid-market. And from a sales performance standpoint, our unit performance that we had in Q2, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks, John, was above where we were at this time last year. We continue to see strong penetration within the existing client base, upsells into the base, whether that's ASO, PEO, retirement. But I would say, Mark, there's strength across the board, both from a new logo standpoint, particularly in the mid-market as well as upsells into the base."", 'Mark Steven Marcon', ""Great. And then despite that strong growth, we're basically assuming a slightly slower pace with -- so it basically would be the SBS side, and you've mentioned an increase in terms of bankruptcies. In terms of the selling season, are there any things that you're seeing in terms of differences between Paychex versus SurePayroll? Any sort of differences -- and I know it's still early in the selling season, but any color that you would -- that you would provide above and beyond what you've already said?"", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. No, Mark. I would say what we're seeing is what we've typically seen, again, SurePayroll more in the micro set. So if I look at the micro set, continuing to see similar type of -- there's a lot of new business starts. So there's a lot of opportunity there for growth. And then in the small business, we're just so early in the key selling season. Really, as you know, the next 60 days are really going to tell us how that's going to shake out. Back to I think what your original question was as well on -- on Management Solutions is, remember, you have the geography issue occurring at the same time. So while we're selling a lot more inside our human capital management base and into our ASO base, some of what we're upselling is PEO. And so they're moving over to the other geography on the P&L, which is a good thing from a long-term perspective. And then as we said, this issue relative to the seasonal hiring which happened in the upper end of the market, that impacted both the PEO on the PEO and insurance side and the ASO market on the Management Solutions side."", 'Mark Steven Marcon', ""That's a great point. And then on the PEO side, just one question with regards to the insurance costs. On an apples-for-apples basis, what sort of price increase are you seeing for similar plans relative to what was offered last year through your various health insurance partners for this coming enrollment season?"", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. Look, you're pointing to an item which I think is a -- is a tailwind that I think will continue to evolve in that is healthcare inflation. And really, I think you'll see that evolve in the future, post pandemic. Pushing costs through the health system is a slow process. It starts with more expenses at the hospital. They have to negotiate with carriers. They have contracts that takes years to do. In our local community, there's unionization and strikes going on at the local hospital for more pay. Then that has to get approved by state legislature. So the cost increase that we saw inflationary in health care, last 2 years is going to start making its way to health plan costs in the future. We're certainly aware of that, and we're doing things to prepare for that. And when we talked about that last year, we did a lot of changes in our healthcare lineups to give more choices to people, making sure that we have the right plans. And I would say that our apples-to-apples was actually highly competitive to what the general inflation was. And we're keeping our MLRs in line to where they've historically been at the same time. And so through some plan designs and some other ways in which our teams have been creative in coming up with some creative health solutions, I think we've got a good portfolio of products and services that our clients are finding very competitive to alternatives that they have. I don't know if that helps."", 'Mark Steven Marcon', ""It does. But would you say, John, that you would be looking at increases for this year in terms of -- would they be higher than last year? And then what sort of impact does that have? Does it make your PEO offering more or less attractive relative to everything else that's out there, as a small business owner that's trying to manage through that situation?"", 'John B. Gibson', ""Well, I would say, given the results and the pipeline that I see that's made us more successful. That's the results I look at. We're not in a -- we're in a very competitive environment. So most of the deals that we're involved in, someone else is involved in. And I think our lineup is very comparable. I think what you -- what I would say is that we manage our plans in such a way that we tend to beat the standard health inflation, and we've broadened our portfolio of offerings, such that I think there is something for every client, they can find something that they want in our plans. And I think that breadth of services and breadth of options is one of the things that differentiates us from others."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research.', 'Scott Darren Wurtzel', 'Just one from me quickly. Can you remind us of what your top end market exposures are by vertical, maybe in the PEO segment? We have heard from one of your peers who were seeing some challenges sort of on the pace per control worksite employee side and PEO mostly due to some certain end market exposures. So it would be very helpful if you guys can just remind us of where you guys have some of your larger exposures in the PEO.', 'John B. Gibson', ""Scott, we do not have any high concentrations in our PEO. It's the general market. Remember, historically, our PEO was really an upsell within our client base, our payroll client base. Our payroll client base is diverse as the country's small business market.We didn't originate in a vertical strategy as a business from PEO perspective. So we never got highly concentrated in any particular area. We maybe had some geographic concentration before the acquisition of the Oasis, but the Oasis acquisition really made us a broad national player. And so there's no one industry concentration that really drives that business."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.', 'Unidentified Analyst', 'This is David on -- David [Page] for Ashish. I just had a quick one regarding the organic growth in Management Solutions in the quarter. It looks like you grew revenue by 4%. But maybe you could just -- if you could remind us what the organic growth is? It looks like you had a small $200 million acquisition. So that would be helpful.', 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes. Yes, I mean, that was a very small contributor, David, to growth in the quarter. And the other thing you need to keep in mind, we kind of gave you color on ERTC being a slight tailwind in the first half. It was actually a headwind in Q2. So most of that came in Q1. So you're kind of -- you have the headwind of ERTC, you have a slight tailwind from the acquisition. But the organic growth rate is not going to be too far different from what you see as reported."", 'Operator', 'Our last question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.', 'Tien-Tsin Huang', ""Yes, just to close out the call. You mentioned the LTV for the PEO business being attractive. I don't think I've heard that from Paychex for all these years. So could you elaborate on that relative to the ASO or HRO or you think you can't size it just the ratio there? Just love to learn more on that."", 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes. I mean we've talked about it in the past that certainly when we look across all of the different solutions that we offer, the PEO is certainly the highest lifetime value. And as you can imagine, when you start getting all of the -- you get into that PEO model, and they have -- the client has their health insurance and their workers' comp and insurance and they're [SUI] with us and all the different offerings. That's really our full solution that we offer. You're getting more hooks into them. And particularly when they have their health insurance with us, if they have their health insurance with us, if they were to leave the PEO, that would be very disruptive for their employees. They may have to get new insurance cards. They may have to -- they might be in a different network, might have to change doctors. So that's very disruptive. And so you get a lot of hooks into them in that model. And as you know, retention is a big driver of lifetime value. So although when we're selling clients, we want to put them in the right model that meets their needs, ultimately -- and that was, as we've talked about, one of our strategies this year is really to go back into that base, get them over into that PEO model because the economics in that model over the long term are very favorable. And so that's part of our strategy."", 'Tien-Tsin Huang', 'Got it. Yes. I know the notionals are high. But in my mind, the payroll -- the [costs] as payroll business and retention (inaudible) margins are so high. I figured that was also a tough competition.', 'Robert Lewis Schrader', ""Yes, it's really the retention that drives up..."", 'John B. Gibson', ""Yes. Tien-Tsin, I think it's a very easy thing. If you think about the way we approach it, you've got our HCM platform, and you know that on a stand-alone basis is a good business to be in. We then add our what you'd say is ASOs. You add an HR professional, then you got someone advising your business. There's more value there. We know our retentive nature of that is high.Now you get into adding the insurance and as Bob said, because we've done such a strong job of managing that over the long term, that there's a predictable health inflation metric that becomes very attractive in terms of certainty for the clients there. And then you mentioned [SUI], you mentioned everything else. So you've got a profitable business on top of a profitable business on top of a sticky product. And so you just keep it there. And I think the evidence is, both in terms of you look at the national studies, et cetera, is the survivability and others, to be fair, tends to be more attractive to larger clients, 20-plus, if you will. So they naturally have a higher survivability rate. But the simple fact is what we see is there's a higher business survivability rate in those that are going with the PEO solution. And then they're staying with us longer, and we're getting all of the flow through and benefit of the HCM and the HR Outsourcing margins."", 'Tien-Tsin Huang', ""And the [CAC] is also low because a good chunk of it is still selling into it. I know you said it's coming -- proposed."", 'John B. Gibson', 'Good point.', 'Robert Lewis Schrader', 'Good point. Yes.', 'John B. Gibson', ""Okay. I think that was it. At this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in a replay of the Webex of this conference call will be archived for approximately 90 days on our website.

Yeah, exactly.', ""JOSH LIPTON: Finally, Paychex shares take a hit as second quarter revenue misses Estimates. Payroll services provider sees a slowdown in quarterly revenue growth. So this one, we're going to call it mixed results, Julie."", 'Sounds like Q2 profit beat. They reported 108 versus 107 on the bottom line. It was the top line they did just mix expectations.', 'CEO was talking here about how the macro environment, he used the word stable for small and midsize businesses. But he also did point out, listen, to some of the headwinds. He knows his customers are facing challenges.', ""He talked about both the cost and access to growth capital, finding talent. And then looking ahead for fiscal '24, they did revise up their guide.

Paychex, obviously, is going to be a company that we're going to watch closely as we watch the unemployment rate next year from a macro perspective. And then from a micro perspective, it's going to be important for what this company is going to do because it tracks pretty closely to what's going on in the broader economy and the labor market."", 'JOSH LIPTON: Yep, good one to watch.']"

Though they’ve specialized in different corners of the fast-food scene, with McDonald’s specializing in burgers and fries and Starbucks catering to the morning crowd looking to get their coffee and treat fix (who can resist those sous-vide egg bites and ready-to-go snack boxes?), one can’t help but notice increasing overlap between the two fast-food juggernauts.', 'Undoubtedly, McDonald’s has been going after that morning (and early afternoon) crowd for years now with McCafé. McDonald’s coffee, All-Day Breakfast, and innovative, new tasty treats have helped the firm gain some traction with the morning crowd. However, it’s the recent launch of McDonald’s spin-off concept CosMc’s that may really stand to put a dent in the market of Starbucks and other caffeinated drink-focused rivals like Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS).', 'Having a look at CosMc’s menu, it’s clear that McDonald’s is going above and beyond just coffee. From specialty iced beverages such as the Smores Cold Brew to customizable, more refreshing lemonades, the menu certainly seems to be more reminiscent of a Dutch Bros than a McDonald’s.', 'In any case, it’s hard not to be optimistic about the new store concept’s future, given that its first store launch seems to be nothing short of an outstanding success. In the days following the store’s launch, the waits were long, absurdly long, with some people reportedly waiting in line for around four hours to get their orders in.', 'Is it all hype when it comes to the first CosMc’s store launch? No doubt. As the novelty begins to fade and the first store does its best to get things going at a quicker speed, I think CosMc’s stands to become a serious threat to stores competing in its proximity.', 'Given McDonald’s reputation for delivering great taste at a great value and at break-neck speed, I do think there’s a universe of potential for McDonald’s as it gets creative and more innovative to grab share away from other corners of the quick-service restaurant scene. For now, I remain bullish on MCD stock as it continues to demonstrate strategic creativity. Also, I’m bullish on SBUX as it looks to stay competitive in the crowded global coffee scene.', 'Though I do not doubt that CosMc’s can hit the spot for customers, there remains one key issue. The company is moving incredibly slow with the rollout of CosMc’s, with only 10 pilot stores in Texas to open by the conclusion of 2024. That’s just a bit disheartening for the many excited prospective consumers outside of Texas.', 'Indeed, a slow and steady approach seems prudent. If CosMc’s stores are a hit, the firm may be ready to go beyond the pilot phase as it looks to commit to a bigger national rollout. Only time will tell when or if such a rollout will happen. For now, though, investors should stay patient with McDonald’s as it shows a willingness to experiment to expand the “McDonald’s universe.”', 'Personally, I’m a fan of the slow CosMc’s rollout. A slow, more localized expansion limits risk as McDonald’s looks to play the long game with a market it clearly has the competence to not only compete but dominate. For now, CosMc’s seems more like a long-term wildcard than anything that could jolt the stock in 2024.', 'As McDonald’s moves forward with CosMc’s while amping up its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities with its recent partnership with Accenture (NASDAQ:ACN), all while inflation backs off, I think margins have a pathway higher from here. Perhaps much higher.', 'Either way, hats off to McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski for having the boldness to push the iconic American brand into new waters. Early signs suggest consumers can’t get enough of CosMc’s. But only time will tell if the spin-off can give Starbucks and Dutch Bros a run for their money.', 'If CosMc’s really starts to increase its store count, perhaps in the latter part of the decade, Starbucks may be at risk of losing a bit of market share to its long-time rival. It’s not like Starbucks will fire back by getting into the business of burgers and fries.', 'For the time being, I don’t view CosMc’s as a credible threat to Starbucks as it continues pushing into new market waters of its own (think China as its economy looks to heal in the coming years). At the end of the day, Starbucks caters to the premium coffee crowd, and with many more drink customization options, I simply do not see people who order very specific beverages taking their business over to the local CosMc’s.', 'Is there customizability when it comes to CosMc’s drinks? Sure, but relative to Starbucks, the menu seems streamlined and designed for people looking to get on their way. And though Starbucks has drive-thru locations of its own, many stores are designed around having patrons take their time as they sip their customized skim matcha lattés or Nitro Cold Brews.', 'I believe CosMc’s and Starbucks serve different people within the morning crowd. CosMc’s appears to be targeting the “on the go” customer looking to get their drink (or food item) fast and at a competitive price, whereas Starbucks seems to be a better fit for the higher-end crowd who’s willing to wait for their customized beverage to be perfected, just the way they like it.', 'On TipRanks, SBUX stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 20 analyst ratings, there are seven Buys and 13 Hold recommendations. The average SBUX stock price target\xa0is $110.79, implying upside potential of 16.2%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $98.00 per share to a high of $125.00 per share.', 'For now, I wouldn’t get worried as a Starbucks investor over the rise of CosMc’s. If anything, it’s Dutch Bros investors that should be more jittery (pardon the pun) as McDonald’s doubles down on caffeine with CosMc’s. Dutch Bros has done a decent job of getting tasty beverages out quickly and efficiently, but it still doesn’t have a brand in the league of a company like Starbucks.', 'I believe Starbucks’ powerful brand and focus on the premium crowd will allow it to retain its dominance as it looks to put its foot back on the growth pedal once again.', 'Disclosure']"

Maria Aspan, senior writer at Fortune, here.', 'Southwest Airlines is having a rough start to this holiday season, thanks to an ongoing hangover from last Christmas.', 'On Monday, the U.S. Department of Transportation said it had fined Southwest a record-breaking $140 million over last year’s holiday meltdown, when a winter storm led the airline to cancel almost 17,000 flights and strand more than 2 million travelers. The government said Southwest’s penalty, for “numerous violations of consumer protection laws,” is 30 times larger than any prior Dept. of Transportation fine over consumer protection violations.', 'Now, as a record 7.5 million people are predicted to start flying for this December’s holidays, Southwest is hoping it can move on from last Christmas. The airline said it has “learned from the event, and now can shift its entire focus to the future.” (It’s trying to look forward on multiple fronts; also this week, Southwest reached a tentative labor agreement with its 11,000 pilots, after three and a half years of negotiations.)', 'Still, it remains to be seen whether Southwest—or any other individual airline—can avoid a similar meltdown this holiday season. That $140 million penalty is one of the most headline-grabbing reminders of just how miserable flying is these days, as I wrote in a recent analysis for Fortune. But it’s far from the only one: Flying is now so terrible that the U.S. government literally can’t keep up with all the people complaining about it.', 'In 2022, the Dept. of Transportation received more than 77,600 official consumer complaints—up 55% from 2021, and more than five times the pre-pandemic levels of 2019—about delays, cancellations, refunds, boarding, baggage, and a whole host of other air travel problems. This year, more than 38,100 consumers filed complaints during the first five months of 2023, according to the federal agency’s monthly Air Travel Consumer Report—and that’s where the data stops. More than half a year later, the Dept. of Transportation says it’s still struggling to work through the flood of complaints it has received from unhappy airline customers since the end of May.', '“It is increasingly clear that consumer complaints are not returning to pre-pandemic levels,” the monthly report says of the data backlog.', 'So the problems with air travel go far beyond one airline or one holiday meltdown or one “hellish” summer of post-Covid vacation chaos. When Benjamin Franklin wrote that “nothing is certain but death and taxes,” he clearly hadn’t experienced the inevitable dysfunction of modern air travel.', 'The air travel system “is so miserable for so many people—and has real downsides for the country,” as author Ganesh Sitaraman told me. A law professor at Vanderbilt University and a longtime former adviser to Elizabeth Warren, he’s written a perfectly-named and well-timed book about the roots of our national breakdown: Why Flying Is Miserable: And How to Fix It.', 'Sitaraman’s advice for “how to fix it” involves various proposals for increasingly regulating the airline industry—proposals that it’s hard to see airlines or many other business interests embracing. But, he points out, our broken air travel system hurts employers and business interests along with consumers:', '“Who wants to start a Fortune 500 company in a city that doesn’t have an airport, or that doesn’t have much airline service?” he says. “That’s a real downside for economic growth and vibrancy and opportunity in lots of different places.”', 'Read my full article here.

The acquisition of Replicon (August 2023) has been supporting Deltek’s growth by boosting its SaaS solutions portfolio.Growing adoption and cross-selling of SaaS solutions and continued GenAI innovation are aiding Aderant’s growth.

ROP expects low-single-digit organic revenue growth for the segment in the fourth quarter of 2023.The solid performance of the Neptune business due to continued demand for ultrasonic meters and increasing adoption of meter data management software is fostering the growth of the Tech-enabled Products segment. Solid performance of Verathon business due to strength across single-use BFlex & GlideScope offerings and continued BladderScan demand bodes well for the segment. The company expects low-double-digit organic growth for the segment in the fourth quarter of 2023.Roper is steadily strengthening its business through acquisitions. In August 2023, the company acquired cloud-based performance management and data solutions provider, Syntellis Performance Solutions.

Acquisitions boosted sales by 9% in the third quarter.The company continues to increase shareholders’ value through dividend payments and share buybacks.

Raw material cost inflation is pushing up the cost of sales.

GM and Apple Inc. AAPL.', 'Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.', 'EMCOR Group, Inc. is a leader in mechanical and electrical construction, industrial and energy infrastructure, and building services. The company serves commercial, industrial, utility, and institutional clients.', 'Analysts have taken a bullish stance on the company’s outlook across the board, pushing it into a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). As shown below, the revisions trend has been particularly positive for the company’s current quarter, up more than 20% over the last several months.', 'In addition, the company is part of the Zacks Building Products – Heavy Construction industry, currently ranked in the top 34% of all Zacks industries. Aside from the improved earnings outlook and favorable industry standing, let’s take a closer look at a few other aspects of the company.', 'EMCOR Group', 'EMCOR shares have delivered a notably strong performance in 2023, up nearly 50% and outperforming the general market handily on the back of better-than-expected quarterly results. Concerning its latest release, the company posted a 33% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate and reported sales 2% ahead of expectations, with revenue of $3.2 billion reflecting a quarterly record.', 'The company’s top line remains in good shape, recovering nicely from pandemic lows in 2020.', 'The better-than-expected quarterly results were driven by continued strength within its U.S. Construction segments, with sales increasing 16% year-over-year on a combined basis. The company continued to see resilient demand for its services, particularly in semiconductors, data centers, manufacturing re-shoring, healthcare, and across the EV value chain.', 'EMCOR lifted its current year revenue and EPS guidance following the strong quarter, now expecting full-year revenues of $12.5 billion and EPS in a band of $12.25 - $12.65 per share ($10.75 – $11.25 per share previously).', 'Investors also stand to reap a passive income from EME shares, presently yielding a modest 0.3% annually paired with a sustainable payout ratio sitting at 6% of its earnings. While the yield may be on the lower end, the company’s 21% five-year annualized dividend growth rate helps pick up the slack.', 'Shares currently trade at a 17.4X forward 12-month earnings multiple, above the five-year median by a fair margin but well off the 20.1X high earlier in 2023. The stock carries a Style Score of “C” for Value.', 'Investors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.', 'The top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

Analysts have taken a bearish stance on the stock, landing it into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).Estimates have been taken lower across the board.', 'In addition, the company resides in the Zacks – Media Conglomerates industry, which is currently ranked in the bottom 29% of all Zacks industries. What’s been going on with the company? Let’s take a closer look at its current standing.', 'Disney ', 'Disney shares have faced adverse price action for some time now, down more than 50% since making all-time highs in early 2021 as the company tries to regain its ‘blockbuster’ movie status. Following hit-after-hit throughout the last decade, several of Disney’s recent releases have failed to attract viewers, with slowing Disney+ subscriber growth also hampering results.', 'The company reported 150.2 million Disney+ subscribers throughout its latest quarterly release, down 14 million, or 8%, from the same period last year. Nonetheless, shares bounced nicely following the mentioned release, helping deliver an 8.3% return since the report date and matching the S&P 500’s performance.', 'The recent favorable price action off the 2023 lows is undoubtedly a good start, but the company’s earnings picture remains under considerable pressure.', 'Disney’s growth profile remains overall positive, underpinned by its Growth Style Score of “A’. Consensus expectations for its current year indicate 16.4% earnings growth on nearly 4% higher sales, with FY25 consensus estimates currently suggesting an additional 30% of earnings growth on 5% higher revenues.', 'The company’s shares presently trade at a 1.9X forward 12-month price-to-sales ratio, beneath the 2.9X five-year median and five-year highs of 4.8X.', 'Negative earnings estimate revisions from analysts paint a challenging picture for the company’s shares in the near term.', 'The Walt Disney Company is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company’s earnings outlook.', 'For those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.', 'Per a Bloomberg article, The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is planning to enhance its credit business in India as the country is one of the fastest-growing economies in the world.', 'Per International Monetary Fund data, India’s gross domestic product is expected to rise 6.3% for the financial year ending March 2024. Also, earlier this month, India’s union home minister stated that the country would become a $5 trillion economy by the end of 2025.', 'GS conducts business as a non-banking financial company in India. Per Sonjoy Chatterjee, the chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) for Goldman in India, the bank intends to broaden the range of its loan offerings in the country.', 'Besides this, Goldman desires to obtain a license to boost its currency trading that would permit it to deal with counterparties like financial investors, equity customers or a corporate customer.', 'Per Reserve Bank of India (RBI) data, India had seven standalone primary dealers as of Apr 1, 2020. Notably, Goldman Sachs (India) Capital Markets Pvt. Ltd. was part of it. Last year, RBI permitted the standalone primary dealers underwriting primary issuances of government bonds to offer all foreign exchange products to its users.', 'In regard to this, Chatterjee stated, “We couldn’t trade the currency in India because we are not a bank.” He further added, “So that’s another area we want to scale up.”', 'Apart from opportunities for credit expansion and currency trading in India, GS believes that the deal-making activity in the country is likely to receive a boost. Particularly, Chatterjee stated that private equity firms are considering deploying a substantial portion of their Asia fund capital in India. Per Chatterjee, “When you have a large Asia fund of $8-$10 billion, India is the most obvious destination.” Hence, the company’s efforts to leverage the growing market is a strategic fit.', 'Goldman has been eyeing growth opportunities of late. Per an internal memo circulated last week, GS had disclosed changes in its senior executives’ positions as it intends to expand its operations in the private credit space. It further aims to double the size of the business targeting assets worth $110 billion under management over the medium term.', 'Such growth moves by GS are necessary to support its top-line expansion since the bank has been pulling back from its consumer lending business as it proved to be costlier than expected. Hence, Goldman’s CEO, David Solomon, decided to shift the bank’s focus back to its traditional strengths, which are investment banking and trading.', 'Accordingly, last month, GS made efforts to offload its General Motors Co. credit card program. The firm informed its employees within the Platform Solutions division, who worked on GM cards, that the process of searching for a new issuer would be initiated by GM.', 'In late November, Goldman also received a proposal from Apple Inc. to end the credit card partnership in the next 12-15 months. Per a Reuters article, the proposal from AAPL included retreating from the entire consumer partnership with Goldman. This included both credit card and savings account facilities.', 'Goldman’s shares have gained 11.3% over the past six months compared with the industry’s 10.5% rise.', 'GS presently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

But the relationship between the two is vital to understand before you buy NextEra Energy Partners. And, notably, that relationship has just changed in an important way. Here's a quick look at three facts you need to know before putting your money on the line."", ""NextEra Energy Partners is a limited partnership run by NextEra Energy. The purpose of creating the partnership was to raise capital for NextEra Energy's capital spending efforts. The way NextEra Energy achieves this is by selling, also known as dropping down, assets (in whole or in part) to NextEra Energy Partners. NextEra Energy Partners affords the purchase by issuing debt and new units."", 'In order to attract investors to the new units, NextEra Energy Partners pays a distribution. That distribution has increased at a fairly rapid rate, historically speaking. Since the first distribution was paid shortly after its initial public offering in 2014, it has grown a huge 360%. That, obviously, comes off of a low base. Looking at just the past five years, the distribution has climbed 85%, which is still pretty impressive.', ""Most of that growth, however, took place during a time when investors were particularly hot on renewable power investments. That enthusiasm has cooled off dramatically. NextEra Energy Partners' units have declined by roughly 66% from their 2021 high-water mark."", ""In fairness, that's not out of line with the decline of the clean energy sector, as seen in the graph above. However, it means that selling units to fund acquisitions is a lot more costly than it once was. The math is pretty simple. When the units were trading at $80 it would require 10 units to be sold to raise $800 (purposely keeping the math simple). Today, with the units trading hands at roughly $30 or so, raising $800 would require the sale of about 27 units. Each additional unit further dilutes existing unitholders and -- perhaps more importantly -- increases the ongoing cost of the distribution."", ""Given the less desirable math mentioned above, the relationship between NextEra Energy Partners and its parent has changed. NextEra Energy no longer sees selling assets to NextEra Energy Partners in quite the same light as it once did. In fact, NextEra Energy has specifically stated that it will pull back on selling NextEra Energy Partners assets because of the MLP's low unit price. At least partly as a result of this, NextEra Energy Partners' distribution growth rate has basically been cut in half."", ""There are other issues going on, including convertible financing that is coming due. So the story isn't quite so simple as a parent company choosing to back away from drop down deals. But the big picture for investors doesn't materially change. NextEra Energy Partners is not the same distribution growth machine it once was, and it probably won't be until its unit price perks up again."", ""To sum it all up, NextEra Energy Partners has been a key funding source for its parent, NextEra Energy. It is no longer as valuable as it once was and that has changed the growth trajectory of NextEra Energy Partners' distribution. If you are considering investing in this partnership, you need to understand that the past is no longer a great guide to the future."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy Partners right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy Partners, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and NextEra Energy Partners wasn't one of them.

These companies give investors a raise every year just for holding shares. And one company has been very generous in recent years, including a 16% bump for shareholders this month.', ""Mastercard (NYSE: MA) just raised its quarterly dividend to $0.66 per share, payable to shareholders of record on Jan. 9, 2024. It's now paying double what it paid shareholders in 2019. And there's reason to think the fintech giant will continue to grow its payout at a similar pace for years to come."", ""Here's why dividend growth investors should consider adding Mastercard to their portfolio ahead of its next dividend payment."", 'Mastercard is one of two payment networks along with Visa (NYSE: V) that nearly all credit card issuing banks use to process payments. The company processed $8.7 trillion of transactions over the last 12 months. Only Visa has processed more ($14.8 trillion).', ""The reason Mastercard is a top choice for credit card issuers is it's spent decades building a network of merchants that run its credit and debit cards. It's practically universally accepted all over the world. That creates a significant hurdle for new competitors to overcome, as it's taken decades for Mastercard to reach this point."", 'The rise of digital payments (and declining use of cash) over the last decade-plus fueled strong profit growth for Mastercard. The company can process as many transactions as consumers and businesses need with minimal additional investment in building out its network or technology.', ""As a result, Mastercard produces a generous operating margin. What's more, it's able to produce margin expansion over time. Through the first nine months of the year, adjusted operating margin improved 0.9 percentage points, reaching a whopping 58.6%."", ""Over the last three years, Mastercard's improved its free cash flow by over 50%. It produced nearly $10 billion in cash for investors over the last 12 months. And it returns nearly all of that cash to shareholders through its growing dividend and share repurchase program. Along with its announcement to increase the dividend, management said the board approved a new $11 billion share repurchase program on top of the existing authorization to buy back $3.5 billion worth of shares."", ""After its recent dividend increase, Mastercard's dividend yields 0.64%. That might not seem like much, but if it keeps raising the dividend that could become a substantial payment in the not-too-distant future."", ""There are several reasons to think Mastercard can keep growing the dividend. First of all, the aforementioned share buyback program creates a lot of room. For one, it reduces the share count, therefore reducing the total amount Mastercard needs to pay in dividends. Moreover, it represents a substantially larger sum than Mastercard's dividend payments, which totaled $2.1 billion over the past 12 months. Over time, investors can expect Mastercard to shift more of its capital returns to dividends."", ""What's more, Mastercard is still growing quickly. As a smaller company than Visa, it has more room to grow, especially in emerging markets. Meanwhile, the secular trend in digital payments is still in the early stages, as many economies are still heavily reliant on cash (including Europe)."", ""As such, investors should expect strong free cash flow growth over time as Mastercard's revenue grows, it leverages its network advantage to expand its operating margin, and that trickles down into exceptional free cash flow. After doubling its dividend in four years, it wouldn't be a surprise to see it double again before the end of the decade."", ""Management's current focus on share repurchases is a sign it sees the stock is still undervalued by the market. While shares trade for a premium to Visa at 37 times trailing earnings (compared to 31x), the premium may be worth the price. Mastercard is growing faster, and analysts expect it to exhibit substantially faster growth on its bottom line over the next five years than its bigger competitor.

Some others have employed dividend cuts or suspension of dividend payments until the overall situation improved. Although a bulk of the firms across diverse sectors has increasingly followed the drift, a handful has chosen to swim against the tide and continue rewarding shareholders with dividend hikes.These stocks have a strong history of dividend growth, which portrays that they are primarily mature companies that are less susceptible to large swings in the market.

And earlier this year, a privately held startup called Vedere Bio II shut down after disappointing early results.', 'Results from the bota-vec study could come next year, according to a federal database.', 'The funding for MeiraGTx, meanwhile, comes at a critical time. Biotech companies have struggled to raise cash during the sector’s pullback, leading many to cut costs, lay off staff or shut down.

However, gains were capped by a weekly report from the Energy Information Administration (""EIA"") that showed builds in crude and fuel stockpiles.On the New York Mercantile Exchange, WTI crude futures gained 28 cents, or 0.4%, to close at $74.22 a barrel yesterday.We believe that oil’s current levels of below $70 allow long-term-oriented market participants to buy shares in quality companies at attractive prices. Investors interested in the sector could benefit from having quality stocks like Murphy USA MUSA, The Williams Companies WMB and Sunoco LP SUN in their portfolio.Let\'s dig deep into EIA’s Weekly Petroleum Status Report for the week ending Dec 15.', 'Crude Oil: The federal government’s EIA report revealed that crude inventories rose 2.9 million barrels compared to analyst expectations of a 2.5 million-barrel increase. The higher-than-expected stockpile gain with the world’s biggest oil consumer was largely thanks to bumper domestic production, which, at 13.3 million barrels per day, is the most on record. This more than offset the effects of strong demand and higher exports. \xa0Total domestic stock now stands at 443.7 million barrels — 6.1% above the year-ago figure of 418.2 million barrels but 1% less than the five-year average.The latest report also showed that supplies at the Cushing terminal (the key delivery hub for U.S. crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange) gained 1.7 million barrels to 32.5 million barrels — the highest since August.Meanwhile, the crude supply cover decreased from 27.6 days in the previous week to 27.4 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 25.6 days.Let’s turn to the products now.Gasoline: Gasoline supplies increased for the fifth successive week. The 2.7 million-barrel rise was primarily attributable to higher production and weaker demand. Analysts had forecast that gasoline inventories would gain 700,000 barrels. At 226.7 million barrels, the current stock of the most widely used petroleum product is a mere 0.3% more than the year-earlier level, while it is 2% below the five-year average range.Distillate: Distillate fuel supplies (including diesel and heating oil) rose for the fourth time in as many weeks. The 1.5 million-barrel increase mainly reflected lower exports and an increase in imports. Meanwhile, the market looked for a supply build of 700,000 barrels. Following last week’s addition, current inventories — at 115 million barrels — are 4.1% below the year-ago level and 10% lower than the five-year average.Refinery Rates: Refinery utilization, at 92.4%, rose 2.2% from the prior week.', 'Having gone through the Weekly Petroleum Status Report, investors interested in the energy space might consider the operators mentioned below.

Illustrating this trend, the S&P 500 has surged 22.4% year to date to come within a whisker of its all-time highs.While the market continues to be largely bullish, the Oil/Energy sector has been engulfed in a downtrend. Against this backdrop, it will be fruitful to invest in top-ranked companies that have defied the sector’s lackluster performance this year.Taking this into account, Murphy USA MUSA, The Williams Companies WMB, Sunoco LP SUN and CrossAmerica Partners LP CAPL make the cut.', ""Complementing the diminishing inflation, the U.S. economy's fundamentals remain robust. With a staggering 5.1% growth in GDP during the third quarter of 2023 and resilient consumer spending, the economic landscape looks promising. Additionally, signals from the central bank suggest an approaching conclusion to the current rate hike cycle. The anticipation of lower market interest rates is expected to lower the cost of funds, providing companies with opportunities to initiate projects and boost capital expenditure."", ""While the S&P 500 equity index has been on a tear, it has been a wild ride for the energy market in 2023, setting pulses racing of even the steadiest investors. In fact, Oil/Energy has been one of the worst-performing sectors. The space has witnessed a total return of (3.5%) so far this year against the S&P 500’s gain of more than 22%.At around $74 per barrel, crude prices are some 20% lower than the 2023 highs reached in late September, primarily due to global economic uncertainties, expanding production capabilities outside OPEC, and abundant inventories. China's economic struggles further dampen global demand forecasts. Meanwhile, natural gas is trading below $3 on high production and predictions of insipid weather-related demand."", 'Even amid a volatile, declining market, some companies have stood firm, indicating investors’ confidence in them. If bought now, these stocks are likely to outperform others and create long-term wealth. However, selecting stocks to buy could be a tricky proposition, especially with oil prices moving like a roller-coaster. One should focus on picking up stocks that have a sound business, good management, and are not pricey.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', '', 'Amid the uncertainty, it is necessary that investors adopt a cautious approach. It is prudent to opt for stocks that have further room for upside. While it is impossible to be sure about such outperformers, this is where the Zacks Rank, which justifies a company’s strong fundamentals, can come in really handy. In particular, we have shortlisted four companies that have outperformed oil prices over the year and have a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.', 'A #1 Ranked stock, Murphy USA is our first pick. It is a leading independent retailer of motor fuel and convenience merchandise in the United States. The proximity of Murphy USA’s fuel stations to Walmart supercenters helps it to leverage the strong and consistent traffic that these stores attract. MUSA’s acquisition of QuickChek Corporation — a family-owned food and beverage chain — is expected to improve its offerings.Murphy USA beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in two of the last four quarters and missed in the other two. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7%, on average. Over the past 60 days, MUSA saw the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 move up 13.2%.Our second choice is The Williams Companies — a premier energy infrastructure provider in North America. The company’s core operations include finding, producing, gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas and natural gas liquids. Boasting a widespread pipeline system of more than 33,000 miles of pipelines, Williams is one of the largest domestic transporters of natural gas by volume. This Tulsa, OK-based Zacks Rank #1 stock, has a current market cap of $42.7 billion.Over the past 60 days, the company saw the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 move up 10.4%. The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate for WMB indicates 17% year-over-year earnings per share growth. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 13.7%, on average.Then we have Sunoco LP. Headquartered in Dallas, TX, SUN participates in the transportation and supply phase of the U.S. petroleum market across a number of states. It also focuses on motor fuel distribution to convenience stores, independent dealers and commercial customers. The Zacks #1 Ranked firm pays out 84.20 cents quarterly distribution ($3.368 per unit annually), which gives it a 5.7% yield at the current unit price.Over the past 60 days, Sunoco saw the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 move up 21.8%. The 2023 Zacks Consensus Estimate for SUN indicates 10.9% year-over-year earnings per share growth. It has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 28.3% on average.Finally, there is CrossAmerica Partners LP. Headquartered in Allentown, PA, wholesale distributor of motor fuels CrossAmerica Partners’ variable rate margins helped it offset the loss in volumes during the pandemic. Further, CAPL’s recent acquisitions of retail and wholesale assets provide it with a wider reach and scale.Over the past 60 days, CrossAmerica Partners saw the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 move up 25%. The Zacks Rank #1 firm, which pays out 52.50 cents quarterly distribution to yield more than 9%, beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings thrice in the trailing four quarters and missed in the other.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nucleus's health application harnesses the power of whole-genome sequencing (WGS). WGS is a comprehensive method for analyzing entire genomes, capable of capturing DNA variants with subtle impacts as well as rare, high-impact variants. Unlike nearly all other DNA analyses, WGS can unearth risks for common conditions like cardiovascular disease and cancer, as well as identify thousands of rare genetic disorders."", 'Now, Nucleus is working with Illumina to scale their vision of leveraging WGS to build a more proactive health care system where people have greater agency. \u200b\u200bThe initiative follows an exponential drop in the price of sequencing a genome and will further the effort to make WGS widely available to the public.', 'It\'s a mission that was inspired by tragedy. In 2005, founder and CEO Kian Sadeghi\'s 16-year-old cousin died suddenly in her sleep. Doctors suspected she may have had long QT syndrome, a rare congenital heart disorder. Sadeghi\'s parents thought it may be ""bad genetics.""', '""I realized that an accessible health platform that uses genomics and lifestyle data to analyze disease risks could have made a life-changing impact on my family,"" Sadeghi says. ""That\'s what we want to build for everyone. That\'s what Nucleus can be.""', 'Sadeghi focused on creating a web application that would redefine how people understood the way their DNA shapes their health and well-being. He conducted extensive research, eventually envisioning a consumer application that combined the forefront of research on genomic technology and analysis, particularly WGS.', ""He assembled a core team of scientists, clinical geneticists, engineers, operators, and writers with a wide range of skills and knowledge. According to Sadeghi, Nucleus' strength stems from the team's collective passion for bringing a unique and revolutionary product to people's everyday health care experience."", ""In 2022, Nucleus received a total of $18 million in funding, largely from Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian's venture capital firm, Seven Seven Six, and Peter Thiel's Founders Fund."", '""Our product will ultimately combine more than 70,000 separate genetic tests into one,"" says Sadeghi. ""We won\'t need to have tens of thousands of different laboratories each offering a different genetic test. WGS supersedes nearly all the others, from single-gene tests for hereditary cancers to small panels and carrier screenings for rare diseases.""', ""Nucleus also provides polygenic risk scores (PRS), a type of analysis that illustrates the combined influence of common DNA variants on a person's disease risks and trait dispositions. Nucleus's PRS analyses can capture the collective effect of over a million of these common variants on each person's health and wellness."", ""And their analysis goes a step further, combining genetic data with nongenetic information for a more comprehensive picture of a user's risk. Knowledge of factors such as age, body mass index, cholesterol levels, and sex assigned at birth enable Nucleus to deliver both relative genetic risk percentiles and individual estimates of absolute risk. In each report, the numbers are framed by clear illustrations and understandable language."", '""We understand the importance of making genetic information available to consumers, and the equal responsibility to keep such vital information strictly confidential and within their full control,"" says Varun Jana, Nucleus\'s chief technology officer. ""Nucleus will implement some of the healthcare industry\'s most stringent data privacy and security procedures.""', 'The company counts increased diversification of genomics datasets among its goals. They aim to foster a better relationship between the scientific community and communities that historically have been underserved and underrepresented in medical and genetic studies.', '""Our team hails from four continents,"" Sadeghi says. ""That diversity is a testament to what we want to build in genetic databases. One of our highest priorities at Nucleus is to build a more equitable genomics future.""', 'It may be a long-term goal, but in the meantime, the Nucleus platform accounts for such imbalances in genetic data. ""We statistically account for people of different ancestries, so that anyone can gain viable and helpful insights into their genetic disposition. It\'s a difficult problem to solve, but we\'re moving closer to the goal every day.""', 'Nucleus has earned CLIA certification and is pursuing CAP accreditation for its WGS informatics laboratory.

It has an enviable track record when it comes to rewarding investors, noting the 22 consecutive years of annual dividend increases it has under its belt. But for the last decade the business has been overshadowed by a massive capital investment project. The next three years should be very different.', 'The biggest news in 2023 for Southern was that it brought Vogtle Unit 3 online. This is one of two large scale nuclear power plants that the utility has been building for roughly a decade. The process has not been a smooth one. There have been massive cost overruns and frequent delays. Shareholders have been hit with multiple one-time charges to help pay for the development effort.', ""But getting the first of the two nuclear power plants that make up the Vogtle project attached to the grid was an important milestone for Southern. The second plant, Vogtle Unit 4, is slated to be online in early 2024. Building large nuclear power plants is not an easy task. The effort is complex and costs a lot of money. Which is why, for the past decade, Southern Company has focused on growing its dividend at roughly the rate of inflation so it could conserve cash. While the 3%-a-year dividend growth rate, annualized, over the past decade isn't exciting, it did maintain the buying power of the dividend for investors. And that occurred even though it was a difficult period for the company."", 'Once Vogtle Unit 4 is attached to the grid, however, the story will change dramatically. First off, the capital investment in this project will stop. Thus, there will be less money going out the door. And, second, the two new Vogtle units will be generating cash flow. The company estimates that it will produce around $700 million in additional cash from operations once both units are attached to the grid.', ""Although there won't be a change in the dividend policy right away, management has hinted strongly that sometime in the next few years there will be. The shift is basically going to go from maintaining the buying power of the dividend to growing the dividend in line with earnings. That's likely to mean the growth rate will jump up into the mid single digits from the low single digits."", 'There are some key goals to hit first, which explains the time lag between getting Vogtle 4 running and the new dividend policy. First, Southern expects to put some of the extra cash toward debt reduction. Second, it has other capital investments it wants to support. And, third, it is looking to lower its payout ratio below 70%. The payout ratio is expected to be around 77% in 2023, so it could take a couple of years to achieve this goal.', ""While there's no way to tell today when Southern's board will step on the accelerator in terms of dividend growth, it seems highly likely that it will happen within the next three years. While 2024 is almost certainly not going to be the year, 2025 is a real possibility. And if that's not the year, then 2026 seems highly likely."", ""For about a decade, Southern's conference calls have been filled with discussions about the Vogtle project. That's going to be the case for at least a few more calls. But once this massive nuclear power construction project is over, and the two new nuclear units have proven reliable, Southern will be setting out on a new path. In the next three years that will likely include a material change in the dividend policy, which will make the stock much more attractive for income investors. If you've been avoiding Southern because of the Vogtle project, you might want to revisit the stock today."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Southern Company right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Southern Company, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Southern Company wasn't one of them.

The KPMG 2024 M&A Outlook Survey found that 7 in 10 dealmakers are working currently on deals and 2 out of 3 said 2024 will be more active. KPMG Head of Deal Advisory & Strategy Carole Streicher joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss the survey's findings and what 2024 will look like for mergers and acquisitions."", '""If you unpack what we think \'24 is going to look like, based on the survey respondents, it\'s quite interesting compared to our private equity versus corporate,"" Streicher notes. ""If you look at the first half of the year, our corporates are saying that they\'re going to be more active in doing deals. And in the second half of the year, our private equity clients and survey respondents are saying they\'re more likely to be active in doing a deal.""', '""Our corporates are much more concerned about transformation of their business... whereas private equity is more cautious around interest rates,"" Streicher adds.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', '[AUDIO TAG]', ""- It appears that dealmakers are optimistic that 2024, will be the return of mergers and acquisitions. That's according to KPMG's 2024 M&A outlook survey. 2/3 of dealmakers responded that they foresee next year being more active. This comes on the heels of what has been an interesting year in the space. The likes of Exxon acquiring Pioneer or Pfizer taking over Seagen."", ""And now Warner Bros is reportedly eyeing a merger with Paramount Global. While many other acquisition attempts have been abandoned. Let's bring in Carole Streicher who is the head of deal advisory and strategy over at KPMG for an exclusive interview, breaking into the survey findings and what's next for M&A in 2024. So if we were to compare 2024 to what the reality is that's played out in 2023 is, what is kind of the net delta here that we're anticipating, Carole."", ""[CAROLE STREICHER]: Yeah, so as we think about the future for 2024 and what we've seen from the response to the survey that we just conducted, that's hot off the press we did it over the last week of November and first week of December, with a couple hundred executives that focused on deals. As you mentioned, Brad that there is 2/3 of the respondents said that they're looking to do deals in 2024. And there's a lot of pieces of the puzzle, that really help bring that to a reality this next year. We're very optimistic here at KPMG. What we see with our clients right now is that they're absolutely leaning in on deals. And as we look at the survey respondents, about 70% of the respondents said that they're currently working on a deal right now."", ""If you unpack what we think 24 is going to look like based on the survey respondents, it's quite interesting, compared to our private equity versus corporate. If you look at the first half of the year. Our corporates are saying that they're going to be more active in doing deals and in the second half of the year. Our private equity clients and survey respondents are saying they're more likely to be active in doing a deal. There's a lot of reasons to unpack that. But that's we're looking into 24 based on what we saw from the survey respondents."", '- Carol, can you talk a little bit more about that and why you think we are seeing that discrepancy?', ""[CAROLE STREICHER]: Yeah, absolutely. So, as you think about the response from our survey respondents, and you just think about the market in general, our corporates are much more concerned about transformation of their business. And they are very leaning into deals that are going to help them expedite the transformation of their business. Whereas private equity is more cautious around the interest rates. And at KPMG, we believe that there's going to be quarters point drops in interest rates, starting in the spring of next year."", ""And that therefore, makes our corporates a little bit less sensitive to those interest rates, increases or decreases if you will, and more bullish around doing the deal in this first half of the year. Private equity might sit on the sidelines a little bit as interest rates start to come down, as they are more sensitive to the interest rate environment in executing deals. So I think that's a little bit of what's happening. The other thing that we oftentimes look at, is during an election year that can have some headwinds to deal activity."", ""But based on the survey respondents, that was much lower on their list. And isn't a deterrent to doing deals this year. They were more concerned around, the market stability, interest rates, driving transformation for their business. And so that's I think, why we're going to see, a, we're optimistic to what we will see from a deal perspective in 2024.""]"

The truth is, even a relatively modest sum of $100 is enough to get started for two reasons. First, nowadays, it isn't hard to find online brokers that offer fractional shares. Second, there are excellent companies whose shares are trading for far less than $100 apiece."", ""Let's consider two stocks you can afford with less than $100 today: Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Doximity (NYSE: DOCS)."", ""Pfizer can't catch a break. The company has been dealing all year long with a steep decline in sales from its coronavirus vaccine Comirnaty, and COVID therapy Paxlovid. The drugmaker's total revenue dropped off a cliff as a result. And more recently, Pfizer disappointed investors with its guidance for 2024. Needless to say, Pfizer stock isn't considered a hot commodity right now."", 'But it should be, at least for investors looking well beyond next year. Pfizer has substantially expanded its lineup this year with a historic string of brand-new approvals. The company has also relied on acquisitions to help. For instance, it dished out $43 billion in cash to buy out cancer specialist Seagen.', ""A corporation can do that when sitting on tons of cash, which Pfizer was due to its success in the coronavirus market. That's the important thing to keep in mind. If it hadn't been for Pfizer hitting gold by marketing Paxlovid and Comirnaty, the company would still have somewhat similar issues, only with less money and less preparation to deal with them."", 'But the steps the company took in the past couple of years have helped ensure that it will have an incredibly deep pipeline that could deliver important new medicines down the line, in addition to the ones it is already launching this year. The drugmaker is a solid dividend stock, too, yielding nearly 6% right now.', ""For all those reasons (and more), Pfizer remains an excellent stock to buy for long-term investors, and the company's shares are changing hands for just $27.22 apiece as of this writing. Investors can easily afford three shares with plenty of cash left on the initial $100 capital to spare."", ""Doximity is a professional networking platform that focuses on medical workers. It offers a range of perks, from communication between doctors to reading up on the latest research in one's field, telemedicine visits with patients, and more."", 'However, Doximity has also failed to keep pace with the broader market this year because its financial results are not as strong as they once were. For instance, in the second quarter of its fiscal 2024, ended on Sept. 30, Doximity revenue grew by just 11% year over year $113.6 million. That compares unfavorably to the top-line growth rates investors are used to in the past.', ""Still, there are many things to like about Doximity's business. First, the company is already profitable. It reported an adjusted net income of $45.6 million in its latest period, an increase of 26% year over year. Second, Doximity typically reports excellent margins. The company's adjusted net profit margin came in at 40.1%, compared to 35.4% in the year-ago period. Third, Doximity benefits from a solid competitive advantage in the form of the network effect."", 'It has already attracted more than 80% of physicians and more than 90% of graduating medical students in the U.S. On top of that, the 20 largest pharmaceutical companies and the 20 largest health systems all use the platform to interact directly with physicians, be it to post job offers or advertise results from clinical trials for medicines.This deep ecosystem ensures that in the future, more physicians -- and companies looking to communicate with them -- will join the platform.', ""Lastly, Doximity still sees a long runway for growth ahead. The company estimates a total addressable market of $18.5 billion. Its trailing 12-month revenue is far less than 10% of that at $448 million. Meanwhile, Doximity's shares are just $27 each right now. Investors who get in now at these levels could be handsomely rewarded."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Pfizer right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Pfizer, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Pfizer wasn't one of them.

It's a mammoth market and one that looks to be heating up with a growing number of large healthcare companies showing interest in the space. Below, I'll look at some of the top names in the weight-loss market today, and others you may not have realized could be potential rivals in the future."", 'Two of the biggest names in weight loss today are Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO). Eli Lilly makes Zepbound (tirzepatide) while Novo Nordisk is the name behind Ozempic (semaglutide), its diabetes treatment people have been using off-label for weight loss, and Wegovy (semaglutide), its actual weight-loss drug.', 'These glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists help curb appetite and have been rising in popularity, and that trend should continue for the foreseeable future. The early results suggest that Zepbound, also marketed under the name Mounjaro for diabetes, can help people achieve more weight loss than Wegovy. In clinical studies, tirzepatide was able to help patients lose 26.6% of their body weight over 84 weeks. By comparison, patients taking Wegovy lost about 15%, over a shorter period of 68 weeks. ', 'This is still the early stages and a lot can change, but these are the two companies and the drugs that look poised to dominate the weight-loss market in the years ahead.', ""A couple of companies that investors shouldn't count out in the battle for weight-loss supremacy just yet are Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and AstraZeneca (NASDAQ: AZN). While neither has a weight-loss drug that can compete with Wegovy or Zepbound today, they are working on drugs that could snag some market share in the future."", ""Earlier this month, Pfizer announced that it was discontinuing a twice-daily weight-loss drug due to too many adverse side effects on patients. But it is still developing a once-daily version of danuglipron, which it is optimistic may have fewer side effects. A daily pill could be a more enticing treatment option for patients; both Wegovy and Zepbound are injectables. Both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are working on oral weight-loss treatments and the company that comes out with a safe and effective pill could prove to be the market leader in the long run, which is why investors should be careful not to rule out Pfizer's potential in the market just yet."", ""AstraZeneca is another company that is making an attempt to bring a weight-loss drug to market. While it gave up on its GLP-1 drug candidate cotadutide earlier this year, the company doesn't appear to be done with pursuing weight-loss treatments. Last month, AstraZeneca announced it would be acquiring a license for an anti-obesity medication, ECC5004, from a Eccogene, a Chinese-based company. The deal could be worth up to $2 billion. "", ""What's promising about the drug is that AstraZeneca believes it may not have as many side effects as the injectables in the market today. If that turns out to be true, it could be a potential underdog in this race. It's still early on and the drug is entering phase 2 trials but it's one worth keeping an eye on."", 'Yet another large healthcare company looking to be a player in the mammoth weight-loss market is Roche (OTC: RHHBY). This month, it announced it would be acquiring Carmot Therapeutics for an upfront payment of $2.7 billion. It could pay another $400 million if certain milestones are achieved.', 'Through the deal, Roche will acquire a promising once-daily injectable, CT-388. The caveat, however, is that the drug is still in early-stage trials and even if it proves to be effective and safe, it may not be on the market until 2030 or later. That puts Roche firmly at the back of the pack right now as by then a lot could change in the industry. While it could pursue more acquisitions to accelerate its opportunities, at this point, it could still be years before investors know how strong of a player Roche is in the weight-loss market.', ""If you're looking for a top weight-loss stock to buy, then Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk are still your best choices today -- provided that you are comfortable with their respective valuations. Novo Nordisk is a bit cheaper (it trades at around 40 times earnings while Eli Lilly is around 100) but both could be good buys for the long haul."", ""The other stocks are simply too far behind right now and it's too early to tell if they will abandon their weight-loss products; both Pfizer and AstraZeneca have recently given up on less-than-promising treatment options. And Roche isn't any more attractive at this rate, as it doesn't appear to be in any rush to get a competitive product to market anytime soon."", 'Unless you have other reasons for investing in Pfizer, AstraZeneca, or Roche, you may be better off taking a wait-and-see approach with these healthcare stocks for now, as there is no certainty they will have any competitive weight-loss products available in the future.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Eli Lilly right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Eli Lilly, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Eli Lilly wasn't one of them.

It currently sits 80% below that record high. And even in 2023, the shares have declined 13% (as of Dec. 21), which is upsetting given the market's healthy gains."", 'Better days might be on the horizon. There are reasons to believe that PayPal could explode higher in 2024.', ""As a digital payments platform, the purchasing activity that PayPal handles skews more toward discretionary items. It's not surprising that softer economic conditions, which are the result of higher interest rates and above-normal inflation, hurt the business. Revenue and total payment volume (TPV) increased 9% and 8%, respectively, in 2022. The top-line growth rate was similar through the first nine months of 2023, a far cry from the monster gains posted in the years before. "", 'The Federal Reserve has hinted that it could cut interest rates at various points throughout 2024. This would be an accommodative stance that could boost the economy, leading to higher consumer confidence and greater discretionary spending.', ""There's no doubt that a stronger economic backdrop would help PayPal get its TPV and revenue growth back to double-digit levels.

You saw the AI juggernaut coming from a mile away, and there's no stopping it now."", 'When OpenAI released the ChatGPT tool a year ago, that move sparked a worldwide fascination with AI systems. As it turns out, ChatGPT is just the tip of a much larger AI iceberg. Computers have dominated logic-based domains, such as simple math and world-class chess, for years, but now they can take on more creative jobs.', 'Generative AI comes in many flavors.

Per Chatterjee, “When you have a large Asia fund of $8-$10 billion, India is the most obvious destination.” Hence, the company’s efforts to leverage the growing market is a strategic fit.', 'Goldman has been eyeing growth opportunities of late. Per an internal memo circulated last week, GS had disclosed changes in its senior executives’ positions as it intends to expand its operations in the private credit space. It further aims to double the size of the business targeting assets worth $110 billion under management over the medium term.', 'Such growth moves by GS are necessary to support its top-line expansion since the bank has been pulling back from its consumer lending business as it proved to be costlier than expected. Hence, Goldman’s CEO, David Solomon, decided to shift the bank’s focus back to its traditional strengths, which are investment banking and trading.', 'Accordingly, last month, GS made efforts to offload its General Motors Co. credit card program.

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, Live Nation LYV and Amazon.com (AMZN).', 'Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.', 'Pinduoduo or Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock PDD Holdings is an Ireland-based Chinese e-commerce platform founded in 2015. Though PDD is much younger than its rivals like Alibaba Group (BABA) or VIP Shop Holdings (VIPS), PDD has gained significant popularity in a relatively short period, becoming one of the largest e-commerce companies in China.', 'Last quarter, PDD’s quarterly earnings grew 31% while revenue soared 89% year-over-year. In fact, for several quarters in a row, PDD has grown the top and bottom-line growth at a robust double-digit clip, far outpacing both its domestic and foreign industry group peers.', 'The main driver of growth is PDD’s wildly popular online marketplace Temu. Temu is PDD’s discount e-commerce platform, which leverages Chinese vendors to sell and ship directly to customers in the destination country. Because Temu cuts out the intermediary and takes advantage of low-cost labor and product inputs from China, the website can undercut other e-commerce websites like Alibaba’s AliExpress or Amazon (AMZN).', 'PDD’s websites also offer unique features that are unavailable on other mainstream e-commerce websites, including:', '· Users can form groups to purchase the same product together, allowing them to benefit from lower prices.', '· PDD incorporates gamification and social networking elements to engage users more than traditional websites.', '· Unlike other platforms, PDD is heavily focused on its mobile app, which is designed to be user-friendly and accessible.', 'Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates predict that PDD’s rapid growth will continue well into 2024. Analysts anticipate double-digit earnings and revenue growth over the next few quarters.', 'It’s one thing to have high EPS expectations and a whole other thing to execute on those expectations. PDD has done the latter. Over the past 11 quarters, the discount e-commerce giant has surpassed expectations each quarter while handily beating expectations by 25% or more over the past three quarters.', 'After reporting earnings on November 28th, PDD shares launched higher by 18% on volume nearly three times the average. Such power and volume indicate that institutional investors are rushing to enter the stock. Further, because PDD has held its earnings gap and volume has dried up, it is a sign that investors with significant gains in the stock are unwilling to part with shares.', 'Finally, investors should not overlook PDD’s relative strength versus other Chinese stocks. While China’s economy and stock market have struggled, PDD has thrived. If China is to recover, PDD should see even more strength.', 'According to the Wall Street Journal, the Biden administration is weighing a plan to reduce tariffs on Chinese consumer products. Meanwhile, China recently approved the first Boeing (BA) 787 delivery since 2021. If tensions between the world’s two largest economies dissipate, it will be another bullish catalyst for PDD.', 'PDD has emerged as a force to be reckoned with in the Chinese and international e-commerce landscape, outpacing competitors with its innovative platform, Temu. With a focus on heavily discounted offerings, unique features like group buying and interactive elements, and a mobile-centric approach, PDD continues to experience robust growth in earnings and revenue. Expect shares to be higher in the next six to twelve months.', 'Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock Cisco is a leading multinational technology company specializing in networking hardware, software, and telecommunications solutions. Known for its extensive product portfolio, Cisco provides a range of networking equipment, including routers and switches, and software solutions for network management, security, and collaboration.', ""The company offers telecommunications equipment, such as IP phones and video conferencing systems, as well as data center technologies and cybersecurity solutions. Cisco's expertise extends to cloud services, Internet of Things (IoT), and it provides consulting, support, and training services. As a key player in the IT industry, Cisco plays a vital role in enabling connectivity, communication, and secure data management for businesses and organizations worldwide."", 'Nothing is more painful for an investor than being in a stock that is underperforming as the overall market is rising. Because 75% of stocks follow the general market’s direction, a major red flag for prospective CSCO investors should be its abhorrent price performance in 2023. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 ETF is up more than 50% year-to-date, CSCO shares are flat. It’s safe to presume that CSCO will underperform even more if US equities retreat at any point in 2024.', 'What’s behind Cisco’s underwhelming price action? Cisco’s product orders are set to decline by 20% due to elevated inventory levels at the company’s largest customers.', 'The troubling trend is expected to persist and hurt Cisco’s earnings performance over the next couple of quarters by diminishing top-line growth. Analysts agree – Cisco’s Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) is negative. According to our intensive 10-year back test at Zacks, when a company sports a negative ESP score combined with a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell), most stocks will miss on earnings and will underperform over the twelve months.', 'Cisco has been forced to offer discounts and deals in response to stiff competition from competitors like Arista Networks (ANET), Juniper Networks (JNPR), and Hewlett Packard (HPE).', 'Beyond the overall market direction and earnings estimates, the most critical factor that drives a stock’s price is its industry group. CSCO’s Computer – Networking industry, ranks 235 out of 252, putting it in the bottom 7% of all industries tracked by Zacks.', 'Cisco faces significant challenges that warrant investor caution. With a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell), the company has demonstrated relative weakness, lagging behind the market’s overall performance. Slowing growth, a cutthroat competitive landscape, and a weak industry group make CSCO shares an avoid at this juncture.', 'U.S. consumer confidence registered a bigger-than-expected jump in December, per the latest report from The Conference Board. The much-viewed Consumer Confidence Index hit 110.7 in the current month, significantly rising from a downwardly revised figure of 101.0 in November. The Present Situation Index rose to 148.5 from 136.5 in November.', 'More importantly, American consumers are feeling more secure about their prospects over the next six months, as the Expectations Index jumped to 85.6 in December, much better than November’s downwardly revised figure of 77.4. This significantly reduces the threat of an impending recession in the near term, as a reading below 80 generally indicates a recession.', 'The Federal Reserve’s heightened series of rate hikes, escalating from record-low levels in March 2022 to the current 5.25-5.50%, impacted growth-oriented companies, and small and medium-sized businesses.', 'However, at its Dec 13 meeting, the Federal Reserve kept the interest rate steady for the third straight time and signaled multiple rate cuts in 2024 due to slowing inflation.', 'The Fed is expected to keep a vigil on the inflation gauge before going for any cuts. It expects core inflation to decline to 3.2% in 2023, 2.4% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025. Inflation is expected to hit the Federal Reserve’s 2% target in 2026.', 'The impressive jump in consumer confidence, both current and near term, reflects the benefits of cooling inflation and hopes of at least three rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2024. This, along with strong retail sales (up 0.3% in November) and lower weekly jobless claims (down 19K per the Dec 14 release), reflects the resiliency of the U.S. economy.', 'According to National Retail Federation data, holiday spending is expected to grow 3-4% over 2022, which is consistent with the average annual holiday increase of 3.6% between 2010 and 2019.', 'In fact, higher consumer spending buoys GDP growth. Per a survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, on an annual-average-over-annual-average basis, real GDP is expected to increase 2.4% in 2023 and 1.7% in 2024. These annual projections are 0.3% and 0.4% higher than the estimates in the previous survey.', 'Despite chances of a bumpy ride in the first half of 2024, U.S. consumer confidence is expected to remain robust on the aforementioned factors. This presents strong growth opportunities for consumer discretionary and retail stocks in 2024.', 'Here, we select three stocks — Royal Caribbean Cruises, Live Nation and Amazon.com — which are well-positioned to benefit from robust consumer confidence in 2024.', 'Each of the above-mentioned companies currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a market cap of more than $10 billion.

The Present Situation Index rose to 148.5 from 136.5 in November.More importantly, American consumers are feeling more secure about their prospects over the next six months, as the Expectations Index jumped to 85.6 in December, much better than November’s downwardly revised figure of 77.4.

Per a survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, on an annual-average-over-annual-average basis, real GDP is expected to increase 2.4% in 2023 and 1.7% in 2024.

These skeptics, according to Cramer, also say because of aggressive rate hikes sooner or later there would be a recession and the economy could “stall.” Cramer, however, rejected this notion and said he is not sure how people come up with such “ill-advised arguments” when we have strong employment data.

First of all, the aforementioned share buyback program creates a lot of room. For one, it reduces the share count, therefore reducing the total amount Mastercard needs to pay in dividends. Moreover, it represents a substantially larger sum than Mastercard's dividend payments, which totaled $2.1 billion over the past 12 months. Over time, investors can expect Mastercard to shift more of its capital returns to dividends."", ""What's more, Mastercard is still growing quickly. As a smaller company than Visa, it has more room to grow, especially in emerging markets. Meanwhile, the secular trend in digital payments is still in the early stages, as many economies are still heavily reliant on cash (including Europe)."", ""As such, investors should expect strong free cash flow growth over time as Mastercard's revenue grows, it leverages its network advantage to expand its operating margin, and that trickles down into exceptional free cash flow. After doubling its dividend in four years, it wouldn't be a surprise to see it double again before the end of the decade."", ""Management's current focus on share repurchases is a sign it sees the stock is still undervalued by the market. While shares trade for a premium to Visa at 37 times trailing earnings (compared to 31x), the premium may be worth the price. Mastercard is growing faster, and analysts expect it to exhibit substantially faster growth on its bottom line over the next five years than its bigger competitor. As such, it's worth adding Mastercard to any dividend growth portfolio, as you can buy shares at a fair price and receive annual raises for the foreseeable future."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Mastercard right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Mastercard, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Mastercard wasn't one of them.

As a new bull market eventually gets rolling, driven by hot new semiconductor technology in support of artificial intelligence (AI), many investors are flocking to chip manufacturers and chip manufacturing equipment stocks (like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing or ASML Holding, for example)."", 'But high growth doesn\'t always mean better stock returns. On the contrary, ""boring"" companies that balance growth with shareholder returns (dividends and stock repurchases) tout some epic market-beating performances.', ""Enter basic tech component manufacturer Amphenol (NYSE: APH). Going back to the date in the late 1990s when we can compare it with the SPDR S&P 500 ETF and Invesco QQQ Trust (which measures the top 100 companies in the Nasdaq Composite index), Amphenol stock has absolutely crushed the market. It's up nearly 10,000% when accounting for reinvested dividends!"", ""How could such a manufacturing powerhouse go largely unnoticed? And is Amphenol stock a buy for 2024? Here's what you need to know."", 'Few investors know about Amphenol, a top tech component manufacturer (its market cap is nearly $60 billion as of this writing) that makes everything from raw cable (audio/video coaxial cable, for example) to cable connectors and assemblies, basic sensors and antenna arrays to circuit boards (what chips are mounted on).', 'Sound boring? Good. Amphenol bears some similar financial traits to analog chip and embedded computer giant Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN), which has doled out low-teens free cash flow-per-share growth for many years (at least up until recently, as TI now needs to spend heavily on constructing new chip fabs).', 'But to draw the comparison simply, rather than focusing on bleeding edge tech manufacturing, Amphenol (and TI) focus on very cheap ""commoditized"" parts that are easy to replace with those from a competitor. However, their competitive advantage is in large-scale manufacturing operational excellence that allows them to turn a healthy profit even on these basic parts and pieces of an electronic system. Some components cost mere pennies each when bought in bulk. And customers often turn to a supplier like Amphenol thanks to its ability to quickly meet their needs and demands, regardless of current economic conditions (like, for example, during the chip shortage of late 2020 through 2021).', 'Amphenol changed institutional investor hands many times over the decades but emerged largely in its current form in the early 1990s. In the late 1990s, global investment firm KKR took a stake in Amphenol and set in on a path that has continued today: one favoring modest organic growth, supplemented by strategic acquisition of smaller manufacturing peers it can stoke more profit from.', ""There's nothing overly glamorous about the strategy, but for the type of end markets the company focuses its manufacturing on, it's clearly been working. Free cash flow-per-share growth is up some 250% over the last decade alone, fueling an even more aggressive 450% rise in dividend payout."", 'For investors looking for more ""boring"" market-beating investments for the coming decade, Amphenol is worth getting familiar with. Though not so sexy, connectors, sensors, and antennas will serve multiple secular growth trends -- like the digitalization of modern vehicles and the aerospace and defense markets, industrial and manufacturing automation, and data center-based AI.', 'There is one problem, though. The stock currently trades for 31 times trailing-12-month earnings per share, and some of its industrial markets are entering a bit of a soft patch as we head into 2024. Excess inventory of some key components paired with global economic worry has temporarily throttled some of these industrial secular growth trends -- though likely only momentarily.', 'Shares trade for a premium price. I thus call this stock a hold-and-monitor for now, but keep an eye out for pullbacks on temporary growth slowdowns the first half of 2024. Buying shares of a company like Amphenol in batches (perhaps using a dollar-cost averaging plan) could yield outsized returns from gradual growth and dividends over the long term.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Amphenol right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Amphenol, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amphenol wasn't one of them.

The company has significantly profited from increased demand for graphics processing units (GPUs), which are crucial for training AI models.', ""Nvidia's business exploded this year. However, it is worth looking at companies at slightly earlier stages in their AI journeys, as they could have more room to run in the coming years."", 'Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) is an exciting option, with years of experience in the chip market. The company also plans to launch a new AI GPU in 2024.', 'So, forget Nvidia. Here is why Intel is a magnificent AI stock to buy instead.', ""It hasn't been easy to be an investor in Intel over the last few years. The company was responsible for more than 80% of the central processing unit (CPU) market for at least a decade, and was the primary chip supplier for Apple's MacBook lineup for years. However, Intel's dominance saw it grow complacent, leaving it vulnerable to more innovative competitors."", ""As a result, Advanced Micro Devices started gradually eating away at Intel's CPU market share in 2017, with Intel's share now down to 69%. Then, in 2020, Apple cut ties with Intel in favor of far more powerful in-house hardware. Intel's stock subsequently dipped 4% over the last three years. Meanwhile, annual revenue tumbled 19%, with operating income down 90%."", 'However, the fall from grace has seemingly lit a fire under Intel again. According to Mercury Research, from the second quarter of 2022 to Q2 2023, Intel regained 3% of its CPU market share from AMD.', ""Moreover, Intel has pivoted its business to the $137 billion AI market, with plans to challenge Nvidia's dominance in 2024. The sector is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030, which would see it rise more than $1 trillion before the end of the decade."", ""As a result, even if Intel can't dethrone Nvidia, projections show there will be plenty of opportunities for Intel to snap up market share and profit significantly from the industry's development."", ""Earlier this month, Intel unveiled Gaudi3, a generative AI chip meant to compete directly with Nvidia's H100. The GPU will begin shipping in 2024 alongside Core Ultra and Xeon chips that include neural processing units, making them capable of running AI programs faster."", ""Shares in Intel have soared more than 70% in 2023, almost entirely thanks to its prospects in AI. While that is nowhere near Nvidia's stock growth in the period, it could mean Intel has more to offer new investors in the coming years."", ""The charts show Intel's earnings could hit nearly $3 per share over the next two fiscal years, while Nvidia's are expected to reach $24 per share. Therefore, on the surface, Nvidia might look like a no-brainer. However, multiplying these figures by the companies' forward price-to-earnings ratios yields a stock price of $130 for Intel and $939 for Nvidia."", ""Looking at their current positions, the figures project Intel's stock will rise 184% and Nvidia's 95% within the next two fiscal years. While both boast impressive growth, Intel is forecast to deliver far more significant gains."", ""The figures align with Nvidia's meteoric rise this year compared to Intel's more gradual expansion. Intel is just getting started in AI and could be in for a lucrative 2024. So if you're looking for an AI stock to add before the new year, Intel is a screaming buy right now instead of Nvidia."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Intel, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Intel wasn't one of them.

Two companies that stand to win big from AI adoption in two distinct industries are Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and SentinelOne (NYSE: S).', 'Both stocks have been on fire in 2023. While shares of AMD have jumped 113%, SentinelOne has shot up 83%, with a big chunk of that jump coming since the beginning of November. The recent stock price action of both companies suggests they may already have gone parabolic -- which refers to a rapid jump in the share price of a company in a short time, similar to the right side of a parabolic curve.', 'However, there is a solid chance that these two AI stocks could go on another parabolic run in 2024.', ""Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is the leader in the market for AI chips. The company reportedly controls between 80% and 95% of this lucrative market, which is going to be worth an estimated $45 billion this year as per AMD's estimates."", ""Nvidia's dominant share explains why it has been growing at a terrific pace in recent quarters. The company's fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue (for the three months ended Oct. 29, 2023) was up 206% year over year to $18.1 billion. Nvidia is forecasting its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue to increase at a faster pace of 233% year over year to $20 billion."", ""AMD, however, is aiming to end Nvidia's free run in the AI chip market with its MI300 series of data center accelerators. Earlier this month, AMD announced the availability of its latest AI accelerators, which will be deployed by the likes of Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Oracle in the cloud. Server manufacturers such as Dell and Super Micro Computer will also be offering server solutions based on AMD's new chips."", ""It is worth noting that AMD's latest MI300 family of processors is based on a 5nm/6nm (nanometer) manufacturing node from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, popularly known as TSMC. This is identical to the node on which Nvidia's flagship H100 AI graphics processing unit (GPU) is based, indicating that AMD is looking to offer a competitive alternative to Nvidia's processors."", ""What's more, AMD's flagship MI300X accelerator is packed with 192GB of HBM3 memory and has a peak bandwidth of 5.3 TB/second. That's higher than Nvidia's H100 processor, which is packed with 80GB of HBM and has a memory bandwidth of 3.35 TB/second. The specs could translate into solid real-world performance as well, with AMD claiming that its MI300X processor could go toe-to-toe with the H100 while performing certain AI tasks."", ""As a result, it won't be surprising to see a big jump in AMD's AI-related revenue in 2024. The company is currently forecasting that it could sell at least $2 billion worth of AI chips next year, but that figure could be much higher considering that AMD could get its hands on a big chunk of supply from its foundry partner next year. Also, AMD sees a $400 billion revenue opportunity in AI chips by 2027, indicating that it could win big from this market in the long run."", ""So, if AMD manages to get its hands on a healthy supply of AI chips to fulfill the robust end-market demand and indeed takes away some share from Nvidia, it could grow at a faster pace than Wall Street's expectations. Consensus estimates suggest that AMD's revenue could increase by 16% in 2024 to $24 billion, but there are emerging catalysts that could help it outpace those estimates. As such, it won't be surprising to see this AI stock go parabolic in 2024 and deliver more upside to investors."", 'The adoption of AI in the cybersecurity market is set to grow rapidly in the long run. According to Bloomberg, generative AI-based cybersecurity spending could grow from just $9 million in 2022 to $14 billion in 2032 at a whopping compound annual growth rate of 109%.', ""SentinelOne is already making the most of this opportunity, as the company's fiscal 2024 third-quarter results (for the three months ended Oct. 31, 2023), which were released on Dec. 5, indicate. The company's quarterly revenue jumped an impressive 42% year over year to $164 million, easily clearing the consensus estimate of $156 million. Even better, SentinelOne posted a smaller loss of $0.03 per share as compared to the prior-year period's $0.16-per-share loss. Analysts would have settled for a loss of $0.08 per share."", ""The company has guided for fiscal 2024 revenue of $616 million, which would be a 46% jump over last year.

A group of seven megacap technology companies known as the ""Magnificent Seven"" have been the driving force behind the index\'s red-hot run in 2023.', 'The Magnificent Seven group is made up of Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Microsoft, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla. These Magnificent Seven stocks delivered handsome gains to investors this year, driven mainly by the growing adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in various industries.', ""Two of them, however, outperformed the rest by a wide margin. These two names are Nvidia and Meta Platforms. While Nvidia's AI-charged run sent the stock up a whopping 239% in 2023, Meta stock surged an impressive 191%, thanks to a solid turnaround in its business. The good part is that these two companies look set to deliver another solid year in 2024."", ""Let's look at the reasons why Nvidia and Meta could soar higher in the new year, and also see why investors would do well to buy these two stocks right away."", 'Investors can rightly point out that Nvidia is trading at a lofty valuation following its surge this year. After all, the stock has a price-to-sales ratio of 27 and trailing earnings multiple of 65.', ""But the pace at which the company grew this year justifies the rich valuation. This is evident from the chart, which shows that Nvidia's revenue has grown at a faster pace than its sales multiple."", ""Similarly, Nvidia's bottom-line growth has also been way faster than the increment in its earnings multiple."", 'Not surprisingly, Nvidia stock is still considered cheap according to Wall Street analysts, especially considering that its forward earnings multiple is lower than other chipmakers, such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices.', ""Buying Nvidia at its current valuation looks like a no-brainer, as the company is likely to deliver much stronger earnings growth than what consensus estimates predict. The semiconductor giant is expected to finish the current fiscal year with adjusted earnings of $11.28 per share, which would be a 237% increase over fiscal 2023. Analysts forecast a 67% increase in Nvidia's earnings in fiscal 2025 (which will begin in February 2024) to $18.81 per share."", ""However, in the past month, 44 analysts covering Nvidia stock have raised their earnings expectations for fiscal 2025. Just three months ago, Nvidia was expected to deliver $16.71 per share in earnings for the next fiscal year. It won't be surprising to see analysts raise their earnings expectations from Nvidia further, given that it is taking steps to tighten its grip over the AI chip market."", ""The company has lined up two powerful AI chips for release in 2024. The GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip is set to hit the market in the second quarter of next year. This chip platform combines Nvidia's Grace central processing unit (CPU) with the Hopper H100 GPU (graphics processing unit) and is also equipped with the latest generation of high-bandwidth memory. Nvidia points out that this chip platform will allow customers to train significantly bigger large language models (LLMs) and could help it maintain its lead over rivals."", ""Also, Nvidia will release the H200 AI GPU in 2024. The company has received orders for this chip already, with major cloud service providers set to deploy it next year. These new chips could boost Nvidia's already-impressive pricing power, as they are upgrades over the current flagship, the H100, which reportedly carries an average price of $30,000. At the same time, Nvidia could witness a sharp increase in shipment volumes of its AI graphics cards next year, as the company is busy ramping up supply."", 'In simpler words, an uptick in unit sales and a potential jump in the average selling price could help Nvidia deliver much stronger earnings growth next year than what consensus estimates forecast. As a result, there is a good chance that Nvidia stock could keep rising in 2024 and deliver market-beating returns once again, which is why investors should look past its valuation and consider buying it before it heads higher.', ""Meta Platforms' eye-popping stock market surge is primarily a result of the solid growth the company has been delivering this year. In the third quarter, Meta's revenue increased 23% year over year to $34 billion, while earnings increased at a faster pace of 168% over the year-ago period to $4.39 per share."", ""Analysts forecast the company's 2023 revenue will increase 5% to $122.6 billion, followed by a stronger jump of 13% next year. This acceleration can be attributed to an improvement in digital ad spending next year, as well as Meta's focus on integrating more AI-enabled features into its social platforms to gain a bigger share of this market."", 'Global digital ad spending is expected to increase by 9% in 2024 to $740 billion. The company recently pointed out that it is testing over 20 ways to improve user experiences on Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp with the help of generative AI.', 'This is in addition to the generative AI-powered features the company launched in October this year to help advertisers create images and backgrounds, as well as multiple copies of ads with varying texts. Meta will also help advertisers improve ad performance by helping them understand which variation of their ads is driving a better response. The company points out that these features will also help advertisers save at least five hours a week, as they will be able to delegate certain tasks to AI.', ""Given that the adoption of AI in the digital marketing space is anticipated to grow at an annual pace of 26% through 2030, Meta's strategy of integrating AI-powered features is likely to bear fruit in the long run. As such, it is not surprising to see that analysts anticipate a nice jump in the company's earnings in 2024."", ""What's more, Meta's earnings could increase at an annual rate of almost 30% for the next five years. That would be a nice jump over the 8% annual earnings growth it clocked in the past five years. The market could reward Meta's improved earnings power with further solid stock price gains."", ""That's why investors would do well to buy this tech stock right now, as it is trading at 24 times forward earnings, a discount to the Nasdaq-100 index's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years."", 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average has climbed to a fresh record high, while the benchmark S&P 500 and growth-driven Nasdaq Composite have powered higher by 24% and 43%, respectively, on a year-to-date basis, as of the closing bell on Dec. 19."", 'Although the rally over the past eight weeks has been broad-based, it\'s the ""Magnificent Seven"" that have done most of the heavy lifting on Wall Street since the year began.', 'The Magnificent Seven are comprised of the seven largest publicly traded companies by market cap in the U.S.:', 'Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)', 'Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)', 'Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)', 'Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)', 'Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA)', 'Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META)', 'Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)', 'The reason the Magnificent Seven have outperformed so substantially this year is because of their respective impenetrable moats and/or competitive advantages.', 'Apple boasts the greatest capital-return program on the planet and is the leading provider of smartphones (by a mile!) in the U.S.', ""Microsoft's Windows still dominates desktop operating systems, while Azure is the global No. 2 in cloud infrastructure-service spending."", ""Alphabet's Google is practically a monopoly, with nearly 92% of worldwide internet search share in November."", ""Amazon's online marketplace brought in roughly $0.40 of every $1 spent in online retail sales in the U.S. in 2022."", ""Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) account for between 80% and 90% of the GPUs currently deployed in high-compute data centers."", 'Meta Platforms owns the world\'s top social media ""real estate"" (led by Facebook), and it drew in close to 4 billion monthly active users during the third quarter.', ""Tesla is North America's leading electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer and the only EV pure play that's currently profitable."", ""The cutting-edge innovation and sustained dominance exhibited by these seven companies isn't lost on Wall Street or its analysts. Based on the high-water price targets issued by a select group of analysts, three Magnificent Seven stocks have upside ranging from 50% to 122% in 2024 (and beyond)."", 'Even though shares of semiconductor stock Nvidia have gained nearly 240% year to date, at least one Wall Street analyst sees triple-digit upside still to come.', ""According to Hans Mosesmann of Rosenblatt Securities, Nvidia can reach $1,100 per share, which would represent a gain of 122% for the company's shareholders. If Mosesmann is correct, it would also add another $1.5 trillion to Nvidia's market cap."", ""It's absolutely no secret that the buzz surrounding Nvidia has to do with its ties to the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). Analysts at PwC have estimated that AI can add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by the turn of the decade. Nvidia is cementing itself as the infrastructure backbone of this close-to-$16 trillion opportunity."", ""Nvidia's A100 and H100 AI-driven GPUs could potentially top a 90% share in AI-accelerated data centers in 2024. Though chip-on-wafer-on-substrate (CoWoS) capacity held the supply of A100 and H100 GPUs back throughout much of the current year, chip-fabrication giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has increased its CoWoS capacity and paved a path for Nvidia to meaningfully increase output in the new year."", ""However, Nvidia's newfound success may come with an ironic problem. You see, the bulk of Nvidia's data-center sales growth through the first nine months of its current fiscal year was driven by A100 and H100 scarcity and truly exceptional pricing power. As Nvidia ramps up production, and new competition enters the arena (ahem, Advanced Micro Devices), Nvidia is liable to lose most of its pricing power. In other words, Nvidia's gross margin may have already peaked."", ""Furthermore, there hasn't been a next-big-thing investment for three decades that didn't endure a period of unsustainable euphoria early in its ramping up -- and AI is unlikely to be the exception. Most businesses are still trying to figure out how to deploy AI solutions to their advantage. Using history as a guide, it's highly unlikely that Mosesmann's $1,100 price target for Nvidia is reached in 2024."", 'The second Magnificent Seven stock with mouthwatering upside, based on the prognostication of one Wall Street analyst, is tech stock Microsoft.', ""Analyst Joel Fishbein of Truist Securities recently anointed the second-largest publicly traded company by market cap with a $600 price target over the next three years. Should Fishbein's forecast come to fruition, Microsoft's shares would increase by 61%, with the company adding almost $1.7 trillion in market cap."", ""It should come as no surprise that Microsoft's burgeoning investments in AI are the primary driver of Fishbein's lofty price target. Microsoft has invested billions into OpenAI, the company that introduced the world to ChatGPT one year ago. OpenAI also played a key role in the incorporation of AI into Microsoft's search engine, Bing."", ""Additionally, Microsoft was quick to introduce generative AI solutions to its cloud-infrastructure service customers via Azure. Generative AI solutions are particularly useful for businesses in that they can tailor marketing to specific customers, provide virtual agents/chatbots that can answer customer queries, and can even offer solutions for supply chain inefficiencies. It's no wonder Azure has been gaining ground in the cloud-infrastructure service space."", ""However, Microsoft's legacy segments are still playing a key role in its success. Though Windows isn't the growth driver it was 20 years ago, it's still the dominant global operating system for computers. The high margins and abundant cash flow Microsoft nets from its legacy operations provides the company with capital to take risks -- e.g., make acquisitions or invest aggressively in new trends, like AI."", ""Although Microsoft shouldn't have any trouble sustaining a low-double-digit growth rate, the company's stock presently appears fully priced for future success (29 times forward earnings). This makes Fishbein's $600 price target over the next three years a potential reach."", 'The third Magnificent Seven stock with abundant upside in 2024 (and potentially beyond) is e-commerce juggernaut, Amazon.', ""According to analyst Alex Haissl of Redburn Atlantic, the world's leading online retailer is expected to reach $230 per share. Should Haissl's forecast become reality in the new year, Amazon shares would increase by 50%, and its market cap would grow by close to $790 billion."", ""The likely catalyst behind Haissl's aggressive price target for Amazon is the company's fast-growing cloud-infrastructure services segment. Despite Azure gaining a bit of ground, Amazon Web Services (AWS) remains the world's top cloud-infrastructure service provider by spending (31% share). Considering that enterprise cloud spending is still in its very early innings of expansion, there's reason to believe AWS can deliver significant operating cash-flow growth for Amazon in the years to come."", ""Amazon's other fast-growing ancillary segments provide another reason to be optimistic about its future. For instance, Amazon attracts more than 2 billion unique visitors to its site each month, which makes it one of the most visited sites globally. This makes the company a logical go-to for advertisers wanting to get their message(s) in front of motivated shoppers. It's the perfect recipe for strong ad-pricing power."", ""Likewise, Amazon surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021. The steady expansion of the company's e-commerce platform, coupled with it gaining the exclusive rights to Thursday Night Football, has likely pushed Prime's subscriber count meaningfully higher."", ""The final selling point for Amazon is the company's valuation. Even though its trailing-12-month price-to-earnings ratio of 81 is enough to make even the most aggressive growth investors cringe, its forward-year multiple-to-cash flow (14) is lower than at any point since becoming a publicly traded company. Among the Magnificent Seven stocks with the greatest upside potential in 2024 (and beyond), it's Amazon that's likeliest to reach its high-water price target."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them.

Seidl, with rates looking similar to what pricing was in the trucking market 20 years ago.', 'Freight conditions worsened after Thanksgiving following a very modest seasonal uplift through November,” according to the consensus at the gathering. Digital brokers continue to bid down freight, and one participant said that freight capacity and pricing will be influenced by the fate of these brokers, many of which are facing tough times.

That compares favorably to energy industry giants like ExxonMobil, which has a yield of just 3.7%. The average energy stock, meanwhile, has a yield of around 3.5%, using the Vanguard Energy Index ETF as a proxy. You need to know more about Devon Energy and its dividend before you buy here.', 'Devon Energy is an onshore U.S. based energy producer. In other words, it drills for oil and natural gas in the continental United States, with exposure to five oil producing regions: the Williston Basin, Powder River Basin, Anadarko Basin, Eagle Ford, and Delaware Basin (which is in Texas, not Delaware).', ""There's no particular reason to be worried where the company operates and, in fact, being only in the United States reduces risk materially relative to a company with operations in foreign countries, given the political stability of this country."", 'Devon is a fairly well-respected energy producer. For example, it has a modest break-even point of around $40 per barrel. That means that as long as oil is above $40, it can make money. It also has a long runway of future drilling opportunities, which it believes will last for over a decade.', ""Drilling for energy is hard work, and sometimes things don't go as planned, so any given quarter's operating performance will vary a bit. But overall, Devon tends to operate a strong business."", 'That said, what it produces is a commodity. There is no material difference between the oil and natural gas that Devon sells and what any other energy producer sells. So it basically has to accept the market price for its product.', ""Oil and natural gas are volatile commodities prone to material and often rapid price changes. That means that Devon's financial results can swing dramatically, sometimes in as little as a quarter."", 'This is where things start to get interesting with Devon Energy. But it helps to put some numbers on the variability here. The company earned $1.43 per share in the third quarter of 2023 based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). That was up from $1.08 per share in the second quarter, which is a big improvement.', ""But it was down from $2.89 per share in the third quarter of 2022, which means it was also quite a big drop. The big takeaway is that Devon Energy's earnings will fluctuate a great deal and often in a big way."", 'What about the dividend? Exxon has chosen to provide investors a growing dividend over time, often taking on debt to support the dividend when energy markets are weak. When the market recovers, Exxon pays down the debt it took on to prepare its balance sheet for the next industry downturn.', ""Devon has chosen an entirely different path, tying its dividend to its financial performance. So the dividend rises during the good times and falls during the bad times. You are effectively sharing more directly in the company's financial performance."", 'Thus, the dividend picture can change as dramatically as earnings, noting that the most recent dividend increase was a huge 57%. That brought the quarterly dividend to $0.77 per share. And yet the dividend is still less than half of the $1.55 per share it was in the third quarter of 2022, when earnings were so high.', ""Also, the dividend got as low as $0.49 in the second quarter of 2023. If you are trying to build an income portfolio with the idea that you will live off a steady stream of dividends, Devon probably won't be for you."", ""And yet Devon can have a place in a diversified portfolio, if you think about it in the right way. Most people still have exposure to energy costs for things like gasoline and home heating. Given Devon's dividend is, in effect, tied to the price of oil and natural gas, it will likely rise just as you are facing rising energy costs. In that way, it can provide a hedge of sorts for the real world energy costs you are facing. For more active investors that could be an attractive investment thesis. But you have to go in knowing that you can't rely on the stock's dividend or read too much into that dividend yield."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Devon Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Devon Energy, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Devon Energy wasn't one of them.

But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%.

And in the last week the share price has popped 5.5%."", ""The past week has proven to be lucrative for Oracle investors, so let's see if fundamentals drove the company's five-year performance."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Oracle ', ""In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS)."", 'During five years of share price growth, Oracle achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 31% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 19% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.', 'You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).', ""It's probably worth noting that the CEO is paid less than the median at similar sized companies. It's always worth keeping an eye on CEO pay, but a more important question is whether the company will grow earnings throughout the years. Before buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.."", ""It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Oracle's TSR for the last 5 years was 155%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!"", ""It's good to see that Oracle has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 34% in the last twelve months. And that does include the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 21%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Oracle better, we need to consider many other factors.

Global shipments of PCs are expected to return to growth next year, and inventory levels across the PC supply chain are mostly back to normal. Smartphone shipments could rise, as well, after a prolonged slump, and the market for servers will be buoyed by insatiable demand for artificial intelligence (AI)-computing capacity.', ""These trends showed up in Micron's (NASDAQ: MU) fiscal first-quarter earnings report in the form of higher revenue, an improving gross margin, and rising average selling prices for DRAM and NAND chips. While 2024 will be a recovery year for Micron, the company expects 2025 to be a record year for the memory-chip industry."", ""Micron is still losing money, but there's now a light at the end of the tunnel. Revenue grew 16% year over year in the first quarter to $4.7 billion, driven mostly by sales of DRAM chips. DRAM bit shipments jumped more than 20% from the previous quarter, and average selling prices edged higher. The NAND business was mixed, with bit shipments dropping by a mid-teens percentage and average selling prices soaring by about 20%."", ""Micron's GAAP gross margin remained in negative territory in the first quarter, although just barely. The company posted a net loss of $1.2 billion, and adjusted free cash flow was negative $333 million."", ""All these metrics are moving in the right direction, and Micron's guidance calls for substantial improvements in the fiscal second quarter. Revenue is expected to rise to $5.3 billion, and the adjusted gross margin should jump to positive 13%. The company still expects to report a net loss, but it will be much smaller."", 'Micron has cut production throughout the downturn, as have others in the industry. These production cuts have helped bring supply and demand back into balance, and the company is aiming to remain disciplined in the year ahead. Overall capital spending in fiscal 2024 will be slightly higher than fiscal 2023, but only because Micron is ramping up production of high-bandwidth memory chips destined for AI accelerators. Capital spending on wafer fab equipment is still expected to decline year over year.', ""On top of keeping capital spending in check, Micron is reallocating equipment that has been underutilized toward new manufacturing nodes, which will further reduce Micron's production capacity. This should help keep pricing at a healthy level, although one aggressive competitor could spoil the party."", ""There are a few important things to know about Micron. First, the company largely manufactures commodity products, which means pricing is primarily a function of supply and demand. Second, the company doesn't have a durable competitive advantage over its peers. This means Micron doesn't have any real pricing power."", ""Micron's bottom line can swing widely from year to year, so trying to value the stock based on a snapshot of the company's earnings isn't a very useful thing to do. The price-to-book value is a useful ratio, although it can only tell you whether Micron stock is expensive or cheap, relative to times in the past. Looking at this metric, Micron's valuation is somewhere in the middle."", ""It's not unreasonable to buy Micron stock, especially considering that demand for the types of memory chips required for AI servers is likely to explode.

The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Aon's TSR for the last 5 years was 110%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."", ""While the broader market gained around 26% in the last year, Aon shareholders lost 3.3% (even including dividends).

On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 16% per year over half a decade. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend.

And that's one of the stocks that you downgraded to neutral as part of this outlook for next year. Is that why that you think that they are going to suffer as a result, perhaps of people trading down a little bit?"", ""NICK SETYAN: And I think that's part of it. Yeah, absolutely. So you know, again, I mean, if you think about fast casual Chipotle, if you think about QSR, you know, Wendy's, McDonald's, et cetera, they're a direct grocery competitor, because they're-- at the end of day, they're direct meal replacement, as opposed to like a full service restaurant, which is more of a social group occasion."", ""And so, you know, on the margin, grocery becomes more competitive. On the margin, again, there's going to be some share shift. And relative to full service, the average check growth, the price increases we've seen over the last few years within fast casual and QSR are about 10 percentage points higher than full service. So that average check gap between the two has come down as well."", ""So I think there's going to be a little bit share shift there as well. That and specifically for Chipotle, the carne asada ends at the end of Q1. And we'll see what they have up their sleeves beyond that. But currently, that's what's driving transactions. That's what's driving the comp upside potential in Q4. And that ends, then the Q1, at the same time, they're going to have to take big price increases in California. 14% of their sales are in California. Units are in California. A higher percentage of sales in California. So to me, that's two whammies at the same time."", ""JOSH LIPTON: And, Nick, I'll get you out of here on this. Cheesecake Factory, that's another name you're now bullish on. You go to a outperform rating on that one, too.

And so all Cheesecake, at this point, has to do is just meet expectations and the stock will go up in the context of small caps that hopefully continue to outperform and regain some of that discount that they've had for the last couple of years as interest rates have been rising."", 'And so in an interest-- in a lower interest rate environment, we also think some of these smaller caps are going to outperform.

Though they’ve specialized in different corners of the fast-food scene, with McDonald’s specializing in burgers and fries and Starbucks catering to the morning crowd looking to get their coffee and treat fix (who can resist those sous-vide egg bites and ready-to-go snack boxes?), one can’t help but notice increasing overlap between the two fast-food juggernauts.', 'Undoubtedly, McDonald’s has been going after that morning (and early afternoon) crowd for years now with McCafé. McDonald’s coffee, All-Day Breakfast, and innovative, new tasty treats have helped the firm gain some traction with the morning crowd. However, it’s the recent launch of McDonald’s spin-off concept CosMc’s that may really stand to put a dent in the market of Starbucks and other caffeinated drink-focused rivals like Dutch Bros (NYSE:BROS).', 'Having a look at CosMc’s menu, it’s clear that McDonald’s is going above and beyond just coffee. From specialty iced beverages such as the Smores Cold Brew to customizable, more refreshing lemonades, the menu certainly seems to be more reminiscent of a Dutch Bros than a McDonald’s.', 'In any case, it’s hard not to be optimistic about the new store concept’s future, given that its first store launch seems to be nothing short of an outstanding success. In the days following the store’s launch, the waits were long, absurdly long, with some people reportedly waiting in line for around four hours to get their orders in.', 'Is it all hype when it comes to the first CosMc’s store launch? No doubt. As the novelty begins to fade and the first store does its best to get things going at a quicker speed, I think CosMc’s stands to become a serious threat to stores competing in its proximity.', 'Given McDonald’s reputation for delivering great taste at a great value and at break-neck speed, I do think there’s a universe of potential for McDonald’s as it gets creative and more innovative to grab share away from other corners of the quick-service restaurant scene. For now, I remain bullish on MCD stock as it continues to demonstrate strategic creativity. Also, I’m bullish on SBUX as it looks to stay competitive in the crowded global coffee scene.', 'Though I do not doubt that CosMc’s can hit the spot for customers, there remains one key issue. The company is moving incredibly slow with the rollout of CosMc’s, with only 10 pilot stores in Texas to open by the conclusion of 2024. That’s just a bit disheartening for the many excited prospective consumers outside of Texas.', 'Indeed, a slow and steady approach seems prudent. If CosMc’s stores are a hit, the firm may be ready to go beyond the pilot phase as it looks to commit to a bigger national rollout. Only time will tell when or if such a rollout will happen. For now, though, investors should stay patient with McDonald’s as it shows a willingness to experiment to expand the “McDonald’s universe.”', 'Personally, I’m a fan of the slow CosMc’s rollout. A slow, more localized expansion limits risk as McDonald’s looks to play the long game with a market it clearly has the competence to not only compete but dominate. For now, CosMc’s seems more like a long-term wildcard than anything that could jolt the stock in 2024.', 'As McDonald’s moves forward with CosMc’s while amping up its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities with its recent partnership with Accenture (NASDAQ:ACN), all while inflation backs off, I think margins have a pathway higher from here. Perhaps much higher.', 'Either way, hats off to McDonald’s CEO Chris Kempczinski for having the boldness to push the iconic American brand into new waters. Early signs suggest consumers can’t get enough of CosMc’s. But only time will tell if the spin-off can give Starbucks and Dutch Bros a run for their money.', 'If CosMc’s really starts to increase its store count, perhaps in the latter part of the decade, Starbucks may be at risk of losing a bit of market share to its long-time rival. It’s not like Starbucks will fire back by getting into the business of burgers and fries.', 'For the time being, I don’t view CosMc’s as a credible threat to Starbucks as it continues pushing into new market waters of its own (think China as its economy looks to heal in the coming years). At the end of the day, Starbucks caters to the premium coffee crowd, and with many more drink customization options, I simply do not see people who order very specific beverages taking their business over to the local CosMc’s.', 'Is there customizability when it comes to CosMc’s drinks? Sure, but relative to Starbucks, the menu seems streamlined and designed for people looking to get on their way. And though Starbucks has drive-thru locations of its own, many stores are designed around having patrons take their time as they sip their customized skim matcha lattés or Nitro Cold Brews.', 'I believe CosMc’s and Starbucks serve different people within the morning crowd. CosMc’s appears to be targeting the “on the go” customer looking to get their drink (or food item) fast and at a competitive price, whereas Starbucks seems to be a better fit for the higher-end crowd who’s willing to wait for their customized beverage to be perfected, just the way they like it.', 'On TipRanks, SBUX stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 20 analyst ratings, there are seven Buys and 13 Hold recommendations. The average SBUX stock price target\xa0is $110.79, implying upside potential of 16.2%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $98.00 per share to a high of $125.00 per share.', 'For now, I wouldn’t get worried as a Starbucks investor over the rise of CosMc’s. If anything, it’s Dutch Bros investors that should be more jittery (pardon the pun) as McDonald’s doubles down on caffeine with CosMc’s. Dutch Bros has done a decent job of getting tasty beverages out quickly and efficiently, but it still doesn’t have a brand in the league of a company like Starbucks.', 'I believe Starbucks’ powerful brand and focus on the premium crowd will allow it to retain its dominance as it looks to put its foot back on the growth pedal once again.', 'Disclosure']"

I think we have a buy rating $300 price target on the name. They're accelerating development, especially in the US. That is accelerating pretty significantly over the next several years. So they're putting more units into the ground. Their same store sales remain healthy. And look, we're not calling for a recession in 2024."", 'We think the economy is still pretty healthy. But this is a name that is fairly recession-resistant. And if there is any sort of consumer slowdown or consumer-led pullback, this is a name that performs particularly well, given its value proposition, also given its business model, highly franchised business across the globe and the largest restaurant company in the world. So I think this is a good play for going into 2024. Again, $300 price target on the name.', ""SEANA SMITH: So Peter, if you are expecting that a name like McDonald's here to outperform, what does that then tell us more broadly speaking about the restaurant sector? And who else is best positioned as you look ahead to 2024?"", ""PETER SALEH: So yeah, I think 2024, at least we're going to start the year with a lot of discounts. We're already seeing that. And in that type of environment, McDonald's tends to take some share. But we also-- you know, one of our top picks for 2024 is Domino's. And I think that name has several specific catalysts for itself."", ""One, they changed their rewards program, which is driving significant engagement with less frequent customers. That changed in September. They're already seeing an acceleration in traffic and in same store sales. That happened in the fourth quarter. We think that continues into 2024. They also have the partnership, one of the last companies to partner with third party aggregators. They partnered with Uber Eats."", ""That is launching as we speak. And the advertising for that will start in early next year. And I think that is going to be a material driver of same store sales growth in 2024 for Domino's, taking them from a very low single digit type comp in the US to a mid-single digit.

While the focus is always on gaining from the share value appreciation, it's not the only way to book profits in the stock markets. Investing in dividend stocks offers one of the best ways of reaping a steady and consistent source of income even when the overall market is under pressure."", 'The best dividend stocks are companies with a strong foothold and solid presence in their respective industries. Nevertheless, dividend stocks are broadly classified into two. Dividend growth stocks are of established companies that have achieved maturity peak. While such companies may not offer higher yields than companies in the same sector, they are cherished as they consistently increase their dividend payouts.', 'On the other hand, high-yield dividend stocks may keep their rate the same as they are already paying much more. Knowing which stock to invest in for dividends can always be challenging, given the myriads of companies offering such payouts. However, that should never be the case when one knows where to look for.', 'One of the best ways of discovering the best dividend stocks for steady income entails following what professionals do. Bill Gates has always been a staunch supporter of technology, given its potential to drive positive change. It is a picture well painted by technology stocks accounting for the most significant portion of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.', 'Ranked as one of the wealthiest people in the world, Gates also has a well-documented affinity for\xa0pursuing dividend income\xa0in the equity markets. Therefore, tracking and following what Gates does and invests in through the Trust is one of the best ways of gaining a head start in investing for dividends.', 'Investing in dividend stocks has always been one of the billionaire investor strategies for generating reliable passive income for supporting a myriad of philanthropic activities. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation finances various global issues, including healthcare, poverty alleviation education, and access to information technology. The Trust also invests in endowments to generate much-needed returns to support philanthropic efforts.', 'As the Trust expands its footprint to reach millions of people in low-income countries worldwide, it has increased its focus and investments in the top dividend stocks that generate consistent dividend income. The investment strategy has allowed the foundation to generate sufficient returns to be able to spend\xa0over $53 billion in grant donations\xa0and other humanitarian activities.', ""While Gates generates a staggering\xa0$464.5 million from his dividend portfolio, most of the gains are based on picking companies with strong and growing dividend yields.

The investment strategy has allowed the billionaire investor to generate consistent dividend income regardless of the prevailing economic situation.', 'The Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to 5.25% is already putting pressure on growth stocks, especially in the technology sector. With the high-interest rate environment expected to remain in place for much longer, growth stocks may have to contend with high-interest expenses from bonds, loans, and convertible debt.', ""Increased interest expenditure from various financing options is likely to pressure companies' earnings, which could affect dividend offering allocations. Money losing technology stocks remain the most vulnerable in a high-interest rate environment as they are the ones that raise significant capital to sustain research and development operations."", 'On the other hand, financial companies are expected to remain resilient as they make more money on high-interest rates on lending to people, companies, and other businesses.

But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$169m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.1% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This should still be a great incentive for management to maximise shareholder value.', ""American Express' earnings per share have been soaring, with growth rates sky high. That EPS growth certainly is attention grabbing, and the large insider ownership only serves to further stoke our interest. The hope is, of course, that the strong growth marks a fundamental improvement in the business economics. So based on this quick analysis, we do think it's worth considering American Express for a spot on your watchlist. Of course, identifying quality businesses is only half the battle; investors need to know whether the stock is undervalued. So you might want to consider this free discounted cashflow valuation of American Express."", 'While opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.', 'Please note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.', 'Have feedback on this article?

He purchased 10.5 million shares of the oil company last week for about $589 million. That brings Berkshire's total stake in Occidental to 27.2%, and it still holds an additional $8.5 billion in preferred shares and warrants."", ""The latest purchase follows news that Occidental will acquire CrownRock for $12 billion, giving investors confidence in Buffett's outlook for the deal. Additionally, Occidental is quickly becoming Buffett's favorite energy stock, as he's been selling off Berkshire's shares of Chevron (NYSE: CVX) this year."", 'Berkshire Hathaway tied itself to Occidental when it provided $10 billion in capital related to its 2019 Anadarko acquisition. In exchange, Berkshire received 100,000 preferred shares of Occidental, which pay an 8% dividend.', ""Occidental's balance sheet took a major blow after the Anadarko acquisition. Not only did it arguably overpay for the assets after a bidding war with Chevron, it also got hit with the huge challenge of COVID-19 (when oil prices crashed). It suspended its dividend as it looked to conserve cash any way possible."", ""Buffett had established a position in Occidental's common stock in 2019 as well, but sold the entire holding at the onset of the pandemic at a severe loss. He didn't start buying up the common stock again until March 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine. And he bet big. He snatched up 136 million shares in the first quarter of the year, and he's purchased more shares in five of the seven quarters since (including the current one)."", ""Meanwhile, Buffett has soured on Chevron. While he also made a big bet on the energy company in Q1 of 2022, he's sold off shares for four straight quarters. Chevron remains Berkshire's largest holding in the energy space, but Occidental is starting to close in on it. And if the trend continues, it won't be long until it overtakes Chevron."", ""There could be any number of reasons Buffett's selling Chevron shares in favor of Occidental. One simple explanation may be that he likes the valuation of Occidental better. That said, the EV/EBITDA ratio for the two companies is close. Chevron shares trade for a multiple of 5.7 versus Occidental's 5.2."", ""The disparity in price to free cash flow is much more pronounced. Chevron trades for 14 time free cash flow while Occidental trades for 8.3. But it's important to remember that excess cash generated by Occidental is required to pay the 8% dividend on Berkshire's preferred shares while buying back as much of that position as reasonable on top of its existing dividend obligation to common stock shareholders."", ""Meanwhile, Occidental's move to buy CrownRock for $12 billion, which will be largely funded with debt, will put further pressure on its free cash flow. While the company expects to sell off certain assets and use the additional cash flow to quickly pay down that debt, it still makes the acquisition risky. Management says the acquisition will generate $1 billion in additional cash flow as long as oil prices remain above $70 per barrel. That's not a lot of wiggle room from today's price in the low $70s."", ""As such, Occidental is a much riskier investment than Chevron. That said, the upside could be far higher if its increasingly strong position in the Permian basin, bolstered by the CrownRock acquisition, works out. Buffett has said he likes the company's position in the West Texas region."", 'Importantly, Occidental\'s management has shown the ability to weather a rough patch, as seen in 2020. And Buffett has expressed a lot of confidence in the leadership team, noting that current CEO Vicki Hollub ""is an extraordinary manager of Occidental."" So if you have similar confidence in Occidental and its management, it may be worth taking a position in one of the riskier oil companies in the market.', 'Should you invest $1,000 in Occidental Petroleum right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Occidental Petroleum, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Occidental Petroleum wasn't one of them.

As 2023 draws to a close, it's down 7% while the S&P 500 is up by 23%. Although the beverage giant beat the market in 2022, that was an aberration from a trend that has been ongoing for decades."", ""But investing is all about the future, not the past. So let's look forward and consider whether or not Coca-Cola stock is a buy right now."", ""Coca-Cola is already the largest beverage company in the world, but that's not stopping it from innovating and reporting strong sales growth. It has been managing through years of challenging times, beginning with the pandemic, and moving into the recent inflationary environment."", 'It restructured to meet changing demand early in the pandemic, creating a more nimble operation that has proven well-suited to this moment. ""The global operating environment is always dynamic, and this quarter was no exception,"" CEO James Quincy said on the third-quarter earnings call.', ""For example, one of Coca-Cola's greatest strengths is its vast distribution system, which can meet changing demand in every country in which it operates."", ""The company's on-the-go business is back, and it has experimented with its beverages in areas such as size and packaging to boost demand when customers are switching down in price. At the same time, it has increased prices to offset higher costs, walking a fine line between keeping loyal fans purchasing their favorite drinks while balancing its expenses. This is working so far. Sales increased 8% year over year in the third quarter, and earnings per share (EPS), as well as comparable EPS, rose modestly above last year."", 'The company has incredible brand power, starting with its eponymous Coca-Cola brand, but it also owns 26 brands that bring in annual sales of at least $1 billion each. Although it slashed its brand collection by about half early in the pandemic to better allocate resources, it still has a portfolio of around 200 beverage brands. These include names you probably know, like Sprite, Minute Maid, BodyArmor, and Fairlife.', 'This leads to strong pricing power and incredible profitability. Coca-Cola has best-in-class profit margins that are high for a consumer goods company. Consider it next to PepsiCo, Proctor & Gamble, Kimberley-Clark, Keurig Dr Pepper, Kraft Heinz, and Monster Beverage.', ""So far, so good, but let's get back to that future part. Coca-Cola already has a broad portion of the market in non-alcoholic, ready-to-drink beverages. Unlike some of its peers, drinks are all it sells, and it's king of the court. While that gives it the brand and pricing power, its relative dominance makes it tougher for it to grow its market share."", 'The company says it has about 35% of the beverage drinker market in developed countries and about half the market in developing countries. It does expect that an expanding addressable market and overall industry growth will help push its sales upward organically.', ""Coca-Cola is so large now that although you can count on it for quality performance, Wall Street doesn't see much room for growth. Over the past 10 years, Coca-Cola stock has gained 47%, or about a quarter of the S&P 500's gain."", 'Coca-Cola is a Dividend King with one of the longest payout-hiking track records on the market, and its dividend yields 3.1% at the current share price -- nearly double the S&P 500 average.', ""But that consistency through thick and thin hasn't been enough to excite investors. Coca-Cola stock is solidly in the value box despite its current strong run and culture of innovation, and investors aren't prizing that right now."", ""How should investors put this all together? Coca-Cola may not go back to beating the market, but you might want to buy it anyway. A properly diversified portfolio should have a range of stocks from value to growth. Coca-Cola provides security, value, and passive income, and it's about as reliable as a dividend stock can be. Those are worthwhile qualities."", ""It also works as a hedge in challenging times, as illustrated by its market-beating performance last year.

We'll use ROE to examine The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), by way of a worked example."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' See our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ', 'ROE can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola is:', '39% = US$11b ÷ US$28b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.39 in profit."", 'One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. As you can see in the graphic below, Coca-Cola has a higher ROE than the average (16%) in the Beverage industry.', ""That's clearly a positive. However, bear in mind that a high ROE doesn’t necessarily indicate efficient profit generation. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk ."", ""Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used."", ""Coca-Cola clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 1.50. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it."", 'Return on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.', ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", 'Of course Coca-Cola may not be the best stock to buy.

One noticeable trend this year has been the divergence in performance among different asset classes. While dividend stocks might not have kept pace with some of the more rapid-growth investments in recent months, their historical track record of stability and consistent returns remain a compelling factor for many investors. Over the years, dividends have played a big role in boosting overall investment gains, especially when people reinvest the money they receive from them. Since 1970, around 70% or more of the total profits from global stocks have come from compounded dividends.', 'Despite a lackluster performance in the current year, analysts hold an optimistic view regarding the prospects of dividend stocks. Ryan Lewenza, a senior vice president and portfolio manager at Turner Investments of Raymond James, discussed with BNN Bloomberg his preferred dividend sectors amidst the challenges posed by recent fluctuations in interest rates. He said that dividend stocks usually perform well during periods of low-interest rates. So, if those interest rates are to come down, then these beaten-up dividend stocks should start to rally. He further said that the telecom and the bank sectors currently have some of the best dividend stocks, offering juicy yields. In addition to this, dividend stocks are attractively valued in this environment. Here are some comments from the analyst:', '“The Dow Jones Dividend Select Index has returned 8.8% annually in the last 20 odd years. That is 2% higher than TSX. So, you always need dividend stocks, especially in 2024.”', ""Mr. Lewenza's focus on long-term returns from dividend stocks aligns with findings from various reports reinforcing the value these stocks bring to investors over extended periods. A report from Middlefield examined the S&P 500's total return from December 31, 1992, to December 31, 2022, breaking it down into two key components. Of the impressive aggregate total return of +1,481%, 47% was attributed to dividends and their reinvestment. The remaining 53% was derived from price appreciation. This breakdown underscores the significant contribution dividends make to overall returns, comprising almost half of the total returns over this period."", 'Some of the best dividend stocks that are gaining traction among investors include The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Bill Gates' investment philosophy and his major investments, and go directly to read Bill Gates' Top 5 Dividend Stocks.\xa0"", ""Every investor dreams of accumulating higher returns and making massive profits while investing in the equity markets. While the focus is always on gaining from the share value appreciation, it's not the only way to book profits in the stock markets. Investing in dividend stocks offers one of the best ways of reaping a steady and consistent source of income even when the overall market is under pressure."", 'The best dividend stocks are companies with a strong foothold and solid presence in their respective industries. Nevertheless, dividend stocks are broadly classified into two. Dividend growth stocks are of established companies that have achieved maturity peak. While such companies may not offer higher yields than companies in the same sector, they are cherished as they consistently increase their dividend payouts.', 'On the other hand, high-yield dividend stocks may keep their rate the same as they are already paying much more. Knowing which stock to invest in for dividends can always be challenging, given the myriads of companies offering such payouts. However, that should never be the case when one knows where to look for.', 'One of the best ways of discovering the best dividend stocks for steady income entails following what professionals do. Bill Gates has always been a staunch supporter of technology, given its potential to drive positive change. It is a picture well painted by technology stocks accounting for the most significant portion of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.', 'Ranked as one of the wealthiest people in the world, Gates also has a well-documented affinity for\xa0pursuing dividend income\xa0in the equity markets. Therefore, tracking and following what Gates does and invests in through the Trust is one of the best ways of gaining a head start in investing for dividends.', 'Investing in dividend stocks has always been one of the billionaire investor strategies for generating reliable passive income for supporting a myriad of philanthropic activities. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation finances various global issues, including healthcare, poverty alleviation education, and access to information technology. The Trust also invests in endowments to generate much-needed returns to support philanthropic efforts.', 'As the Trust expands its footprint to reach millions of people in low-income countries worldwide, it has increased its focus and investments in the top dividend stocks that generate consistent dividend income. The investment strategy has allowed the foundation to generate sufficient returns to be able to spend\xa0over $53 billion in grant donations\xa0and other humanitarian activities.', ""While Gates generates a staggering\xa0$464.5 million from his dividend portfolio, most of the gains are based on picking companies with strong and growing dividend yields. Focusing on solid yields rather than high yields affirms the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's affinity for sustainable long-term income streams. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) are some of the companies that Gates has always turned to, given their track record in paying dividends."", 'Diversification has also been an important strategy that Gates has always relied on, even as he pursued dividend income in the markets. This is evident by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust investing in various sectors, including technology. The investment strategy has allowed the billionaire investor to generate consistent dividend income regardless of the prevailing economic situation.', 'The Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to 5.25% is already putting pressure on growth stocks, especially in the technology sector. With the high-interest rate environment expected to remain in place for much longer, growth stocks may have to contend with high-interest expenses from bonds, loans, and convertible debt.', ""Increased interest expenditure from various financing options is likely to pressure companies' earnings, which could affect dividend offering allocations. Money losing technology stocks remain the most vulnerable in a high-interest rate environment as they are the ones that raise significant capital to sustain research and development operations."", 'On the other hand, financial companies are expected to remain resilient as they make more money on high-interest rates on lending to people, companies, and other businesses. Therefore, diversifying an investment portfolio beyond technology stocks and into financials and consumer goods sectors that perform well amid rising interest rates is a sure way of safeguarding passive income through dividends.', 'Our Methodology', ""Bill Gates concentrates most of his holdings on stocks with a track record of growing and paying dividends over time.

Despite these quarterly fluctuations in product sales, we are encouraged by several long-term trends, including: (1) revenue from higher-margin services like the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Pay, which are growing faster than the overall business, driving better revenue visibility and higher free-cash-flow (FCF) margins; (2) continued gains in global market share in smartphones, wearables, and other hardware categories; and (3) consistent returns of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.

If you want to skip our discussion on the impact of climate change, you can go directly to the 5 Countries That Will Disappear by 2050.', ""Climate change is one of the most pressing global challenges currently. Though Earth's climate has undergone changes across its history, the present warming trend is occurring at a pace not witnessed in the last 10,000 years. Projections indicate that climate change could have a substantial impact on 18% of the global gross domestic product (GDP) by the year 2050, particularly affecting sectors such as tourism and agriculture. The concern is heightened by the significant economic losses experienced in 2022, totaling $313 billion due to natural disasters, mainly stemming from severe heat waves and droughts. These disasters also led to approximately 31,300 deaths. The United States, in particular, has faced a considerable economic impact due to weather and climate-related disasters, with losses exceeding $617 billion between 2018 and 2022. Meanwhile, in 2022, the economic costs surpassed $176 billion, leading to challenges for 13% of Americans who reported economic difficulties due to harsh weather events. This figure has the potential to rise further if measures are not taken to mitigate the effects of climate change."", 'Leading Contributors to Global GHG Emissions', ""Greenhouse gases (GHGs) function by trapping heat in the Earth's atmosphere, and human activities have played a vital role in the rise of GHG emissions over the past century. The main GHG emitters, such as China, the United States, Russia, the European Union, Indonesia, and Brazil, collectively contributed to almost half of the global GHG emissions in 2020. You can read more about 15 Countries That Contribute The Most To Climate Change here. Additionally, climate change is contributing to the global increase in sea levels, posing a significant threat to some of the most vulnerable communities. These populations reside in marginal zones, where the risk of flooding from high tides is on the rise. The average sea levels have increased by more than 8 inches since 1880, and within the last 25 years alone, about three of those inches were gained. On an annual basis, the sea continues to rise by an additional 0.13 inches. Recent research published in February 2022 indicates that the rate of sea level rise is accelerating, and projections suggest a further increase by a foot by the year 2050. These trends raise concerns about countries that will sink in the future."", 'Corporate Response to Climate Change', ""Witnessing the economic impact of climate change, many major corporations are adopting sustainable energy practices as part of their efforts to address climate change. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a key player that is implementing sustainable energy methods. Tesla's solar panels have been very productive, generating more energy than the company's vehicles and factories consumed from 2012 to 2021. Beyond emissions reduction, Tesla Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) solar panels serve a dual purpose by preventing power outages and acting as a backup during grid failures. The company claims that these solar panels offer cost-effective energy per MWh when compared to many fossil fuel alternatives. In its pursuit of sustainability, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has also introduced energy storage technologies such as Powerwall and Powerpack. In September 2023, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) obtained approval to launch pilot programs for its Virtual Power Plant (VPP) initiative in Texas. This initiative enables Powerwall owners to sell excess solar-generated electricity back to the grid, preventing power outages and effectively managing high electricity demand periods."", ""Similarly, Vestas Wind Systems A/S (CPH:VWS), a major wind energy firm, has played a vital role in implementing sustainable energy methods. The company focuses on the design, production, and installation of wind turbines. Vestas' commitment to sustainable energy has led to environmental benefits, preventing the release of 1.5 billion tons of CO2 into the atmosphere. Additionally, Vestas Wind Systems has successfully installed over 145 gigawatts of wind turbines in 85 countries. Another notable company working towards mitigating the impact of climate change is General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). It is a leading American multinational corporation operating in a variety of industries, including healthcare. In 2020, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) announced its aim to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030 for its Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions."", ""Here's what Longleaf Partners said about General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:"", '“After a busy first half of the year, we initiated one new position in the quarter in a business we have successfully owned previously and were able to buy again at a discount within a new corporate structure.

GE was a multi-year portfolio holding for us that started out rocky but ultimately was a good illustration of owning a “quality” business that was temporarily viewed as “value” (aka, perceived as low quality) before ultimately being weighed properly by the market. CEO Larry Culp was a great partner, creating significant value for shareholders and closing the price-to-value gap. Under his leadership, GE materially improved its operations and is well under way on plans to simplify the business by separating it into three world-class companies. The market has finally caught up with reality versus perception and is pricing GE accordingly. Unfortunately, this means we no longer see a margin of safety for the business but will continue to watch GE and Culp closely and hope to have the opportunity to partner with him again.”', 'Katoosha/Shutterstock.com', 'Our Methodology', 'To shortlist the 10 countries that will disappear by 2050, we referred to credible sources like World Atlas, Climate Central, and Business Insider.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

Costco has gained a reputation for these surprise announcements, as it pays a rather small ordinary dividend and then occasionally distributes a much larger one-time payment.', ""Costco has said that special dividends are a part of its DNA. But there are better uses of capital that could reward investors even more. Here's why Costco's special dividend isn't as good as it seems, what Costco could learn from other top companies, and whether the retail stock is a buy now."", ""When it comes to stock price appreciation, Costco has beaten the S&P 500 over the last year, three years, five years, seven years, and 10 years. So it's hard to be too critical of the company, because clearly it is doing a lot right."", ""Costco's returns have been so good that there really hasn't been a need for dividends at all. Investors who have been holding the stock would surely not think twice about the gains they have received in recent years even if there were zero dividends."", ""When a stock is crushing the market year after year, the ordinary dividend is an afterthought rather than a core part of the investment thesis. Perhaps this is why Costco's special dividends have been so thrilling."", ""Costco has been like a rocket ship, and the surprise special dividends have acted like boosters that give the ride an extra jolt in a way that an ordinary dividend simply can't do. The allure of a one-time cash payment that is the equivalent of more than three years of ordinary dividends is exciting and unique, and it fits the overall feel of Costco as an investment, which isn't a reliable dividend stock, but rather something investors expect big gains from -- and are willing to pay a hefty price for."", 'After all, Costco has a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 45.1 and a forward P/E of 42.3. So it is an extremely expensive stock in general, and especially for a wholesale retailer.', 'Every company has a different capital allocation program. But many excellent companies handle it differently, and arguably better, than Costco.', ""As an example, let's look at five different companies in five completely different industries -- Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B), Deere (NYSE: DE), Illinois Tool Works (NYSE: ITW) (an industrial conglomerate commonly known as ITW), Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)."", ""With the exception of P&G, all these stocks have beaten the S&P 500 over the last 10 years. A core part of each company's capital allocation program is buybacks."", ""Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway is famous for not paying any dividends and using excess cash to repurchase its own stock. But its pace of buybacks over the last 10 years doesn't hold a candle to Deere, ITW, or Apple."", 'Deere is a unique industrial because it prioritizes growth and buybacks over its dividend. It invests heavily in automation and artificial intelligence, and is a firm believer that these trends will be a part of the next agricultural revolution. It believes in itself, and therefore it feels that buying back its own stock is a better use of capital than distributing dividends.', 'Similarly, ITW is betting on itself. It has streamlined its business and has very high operating margins, margins that it believes will continue to grow and reach 30% by 2030. Like P&G, ITW is a Dividend King that has paid and raised its dividend for over 50 years. So its ordinary dividend is attractive on its own. But because ITW is so well run, it can afford a hefty buyback program and consistent dividend growth -- a worthy one-two punch and an epic incentive to hold the stock over time.', ""P&G buys back a lot of stock and boosts its dividend. And although it has lagged the market over the last decade, P&G is a beacon of safety and stability with an attractive yield. It's not a stock you invest in to try and necessarily beat the market, but rather to gain supplement income in retirement and preserve capital. It's also a good example of a well-run business that does a great job of returning capital to investors."", ""Apple has crushed the market over the last decade. But interestingly enough, its earnings growth, especially recently, wouldn't be as impressive without buybacks. That's because buybacks decrease the outstanding share count, thereby artificially boosting earnings per share (EPS)."", ""Despite its incredible returns, Apple stock isn't all that expensive relative to the market because, in addition to decent net income growth, its EPS has benefited from buybacks. In hindsight, buybacks were a much better use of capital than dividends (which Apple pays too) because they permanently boost EPS and make Apple a better all-around value. Buybacks are a core reason Apple could continue delivering sizable gains for investors going forward."", 'Costco has done negligible buybacks over the last 10 years. Once factoring in its latest $15 special dividend, it will have paid a total of $37 per share in special dividends over the last 10 years. That decision has proven to be a big problem for the stock.', ""Costco has done a great job growing its top and bottom lines, but the stock has outpaced those growth rates. And because of that, Costco's P/E multiple has ballooned to 45.1, far higher than its 10-year median of 31.8. If Costco had used cash on buybacks instead of special dividends, it would have been able to buy back its stock at a far lower price than the current price, which would have been a smart use of capital, and it would have made Costco's multiple far lower than it is today."", ""Costco's strategy is to wait until it has excess cash on its balance sheet and then use that cash to pay a special dividend. This one is going to cost the company $6.7 billion. Other companies tend to use free cash flow on regularly scheduled dividends, which is more predictable."", ""As we have seen with Deere, ITW, P&G, and Apple, buybacks can work wonders for a company that continues to grow in value, no matter what industry the company is in. Costco stock is now so expensive it makes no sense to invest in it. The appeal is largely centered around its growth and the excitement from the occasional special dividend. But the special dividends get much less exciting once you realize it's one of the worst uses of capital imaginable and it triggers a taxable event, unlike buybacks."", ""Costco is an amazing company and fun to shop at. But I wouldn't touch the stock with a 10-foot pole -- I don't like how it returns money to shareholders, and the valuation is sky-high. Because Costco doesn't grow its earnings at a torrid rate and it isn't buying back a meaningful amount of stock, the only way its valuation can come down is over time or if the stock undergoes a dramatic sell-off. Those aren't appealing prospects. And for that reason, Costco seems like a poor long-term investment."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:', ""The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Costco Wholesale wasn't one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Bill Gates' investment philosophy and his major investments, and go directly to read Bill Gates' Top 5 Dividend Stocks.\xa0"", ""Every investor dreams of accumulating higher returns and making massive profits while investing in the equity markets. While the focus is always on gaining from the share value appreciation, it's not the only way to book profits in the stock markets. Investing in dividend stocks offers one of the best ways of reaping a steady and consistent source of income even when the overall market is under pressure."", 'The best dividend stocks are companies with a strong foothold and solid presence in their respective industries. Nevertheless, dividend stocks are broadly classified into two. Dividend growth stocks are of established companies that have achieved maturity peak. While such companies may not offer higher yields than companies in the same sector, they are cherished as they consistently increase their dividend payouts.', 'On the other hand, high-yield dividend stocks may keep their rate the same as they are already paying much more. Knowing which stock to invest in for dividends can always be challenging, given the myriads of companies offering such payouts. However, that should never be the case when one knows where to look for.', 'One of the best ways of discovering the best dividend stocks for steady income entails following what professionals do. Bill Gates has always been a staunch supporter of technology, given its potential to drive positive change. It is a picture well painted by technology stocks accounting for the most significant portion of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust.', 'Ranked as one of the wealthiest people in the world, Gates also has a well-documented affinity for\xa0pursuing dividend income\xa0in the equity markets. Therefore, tracking and following what Gates does and invests in through the Trust is one of the best ways of gaining a head start in investing for dividends.', 'Investing in dividend stocks has always been one of the billionaire investor strategies for generating reliable passive income for supporting a myriad of philanthropic activities. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation finances various global issues, including healthcare, poverty alleviation education, and access to information technology. The Trust also invests in endowments to generate much-needed returns to support philanthropic efforts.', 'As the Trust expands its footprint to reach millions of people in low-income countries worldwide, it has increased its focus and investments in the top dividend stocks that generate consistent dividend income. The investment strategy has allowed the foundation to generate sufficient returns to be able to spend\xa0over $53 billion in grant donations\xa0and other humanitarian activities.', ""While Gates generates a staggering\xa0$464.5 million from his dividend portfolio, most of the gains are based on picking companies with strong and growing dividend yields. Focusing on solid yields rather than high yields affirms the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's affinity for sustainable long-term income streams. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) are some of the companies that Gates has always turned to, given their track record in paying dividends."", 'Diversification has also been an important strategy that Gates has always relied on, even as he pursued dividend income in the markets. This is evident by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation Trust investing in various sectors, including technology. The investment strategy has allowed the billionaire investor to generate consistent dividend income regardless of the prevailing economic situation.', 'The Federal Reserve hiking interest rates to 5.25% is already putting pressure on growth stocks, especially in the technology sector. With the high-interest rate environment expected to remain in place for much longer, growth stocks may have to contend with high-interest expenses from bonds, loans, and convertible debt.', ""Increased interest expenditure from various financing options is likely to pressure companies' earnings, which could affect dividend offering allocations. Money losing technology stocks remain the most vulnerable in a high-interest rate environment as they are the ones that raise significant capital to sustain research and development operations."", 'On the other hand, financial companies are expected to remain resilient as they make more money on high-interest rates on lending to people, companies, and other businesses. Therefore, diversifying an investment portfolio beyond technology stocks and into financials and consumer goods sectors that perform well amid rising interest rates is a sure way of safeguarding passive income through dividends.', 'Our Methodology', ""Bill Gates concentrates most of his holdings on stocks with a track record of growing and paying dividends over time.

Despite these quarterly fluctuations in product sales, we are encouraged by several long-term trends, including: (1) revenue from higher-margin services like the App Store, iCloud, and Apple Pay, which are growing faster than the overall business, driving better revenue visibility and higher free-cash-flow (FCF) margins; (2) continued gains in global market share in smartphones, wearables, and other hardware categories; and (3) consistent returns of capital to shareholders via share repurchases and dividends.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Sherwin-Williams' (NYSE:SHW) returns on capital, so let's have a look."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Sherwin-Williams:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.22 = US$3.6b ÷ (US$23b - US$6.6b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""Thus, Sherwin-Williams has an ROCE of 22%.

If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company."", ""Sherwin-Williams has not disappointed with their ROCE growth. Looking at the data, we can see that even though capital employed in the business has remained relatively flat, the ROCE generated has risen by 47% over the last five years. Basically the business is generating higher returns from the same amount of capital and that is proof that there are improvements in the company's efficiencies. It's worth looking deeper into this though because while it's great that the business is more efficient, it might also mean that going forward the areas to invest internally for the organic growth are lacking."", ""As discussed above, Sherwin-Williams appears to be getting more proficient at generating returns since capital employed has remained flat but earnings (before interest and tax) are up. Since the stock has returned a staggering 146% to shareholders over the last five years, it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Sherwin-Williams can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead."", ""One more thing to note, we've identified   1 warning sign  with Sherwin-Williams and understanding this should be part of your investment process."", ""If you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our free list of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here."", 'Have feedback on this article?

There are definitely resources to help build these brands.”', 'Boyd oversees about a third of PepsiCo’s roughly two dozen U.S. snacking brands, including SunChips, air-popped PopCorners, Stacy’s pita chips, Bare baked fruit and coconut snacks and Off the Eaten Path vegetable crisps. Together, the eight brands generate about $1.5 billion in revenue annually. Even though they have yet to achieve the $1 billion-plus threshold of Doritos and Cheetos, they “are growing fast,” she said.', 'In its most recent quarter, PepsiCo said smaller, emerging brands, such as PopCorners, SunChips and Miss Vickie’s, each delivered double-digit net revenue growth.', 'PepsiCo’s snacking business is composed mostly of Frito-Lay and Quaker Oats, which together generated more than $26 billion in sales in North America during the company’s 2022 fiscal year — accounting for a little less than a third of the CPG giant’s $86 billion in global sales.', 'To be sure, popular offerings such as Doritos, Fritos and Cheetos that are more widely available are going to get a disproportionate amount of money for innovation and marketing at PepsiCo, Boyd said. These brands cater to people craving an indulgent treat who value the product’s taste and crunch attributes.', 'But the New York-based company’s smaller brands play an equally valuable role in attracting and retaining consumers within its snacking portfolio.', 'These products allow PepsiCo to provide the shopper with a more diverse portfolio of snacking brands that can meet their broader food consumption needs, such as eating healthier, or that cater to a particular moment during their day.', 'PepsiCo observed that roughly two-thirds of its Sun Chips brand is consumed with a sandwich or at a meal. It’s a major reason why Subway restaurants, for example, typically carry it, along with Rold Gold pretzels and Lay’s potato chips — instead of one of PepsiCo’s other brands more commonly associated with snacking.', 'In other cases, these niche brands address demand for better-for-you offerings, such as Off the Eaten Path which is made with vegetables, Bare with fruit or Sun Chips with whole grains and sometimes black beans.', 'Frito-Lay also is doing more to promote Off the Eaten Path and Bare in places like health clubs and national parks where consumers tend to have a healthier lifestyle. The targeted approach typically requires PepsiCo to spend less money to promote them.', '“Those brands probably have fewer consumers, but there still is an opportunity to drive awareness,” Boyd said. ', 'Brittany Quatrochi, an analyst at Edward Jones, said PepsiCo’s smaller brands tend to grow faster than some of its larger more established offerings because of their size — providing the snacks maker with a valuable platform to expand its business. They also give the CPG giant more opportunities to reach different consumers whose needs and demands are closely aligned with recently popular trends.', '“PepsiCo is a great steward of brands,” Quatrochi said. “They want to expand the scope and presence of their products and try to capture new occasions and new customers. One of the ways you can do that is through these emerging brands.” ', 'While PepsiCo has been increasing its mix of better-for-you snacks for years, it doubled down on the effort in 2021 with its Pep+ sustainability initiative.', 'The measure included diversifying its ingredients mix and expanding the company’s use of nuts and seeds that were better for consumers and the environment. The move was in response to consumers who are looking for a mix of indulgent and healthier in what they eat, and retailers by giving them more of what shoppers are looking for.', ""“There is a broad spectrum of consumer needs and snacks. Whether that is snacks that provide a reward or treat or snacks that are more nourishing and provide a balance of nutrition and taste,” Boyd said. “As we think about meeting the needs of consumers, we have to have a portfolio that's broad enough to meet these varying needs.”"", 'This story was originally published on Food Dive.

335,90d875f2-ba8b-398f-8860-bac87dec6fdb,REGN,2023-12-22,These 4 Measures Indicate That Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN) Is Using Debt Reasonably Well,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-measures-indicate-regeneron-pharmaceuticals-110111961.html,1703242871,STORY,['REGN'],"[""David Iben put it well when he said, 'Volatility is not a risk we care about. What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:REGN) makes use of debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?"", ""Debt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together."", ' See our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals ', 'As you can see below, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had US$1.98b of debt, at September 2023, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. But it also has US$9.91b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$7.93b net cash.', 'We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals had liabilities of US$3.60b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$3.66b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$9.91b as well as receivables valued at US$5.58b due within 12 months. So it actually has US$8.24b more liquid assets than total liabilities.', ""This short term liquidity is a sign that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals could probably pay off its debt with ease, as its balance sheet is far from stretched. Succinctly put, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!"", ""The modesty of its debt load may become crucial for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals if management cannot prevent a repeat of the 32% cut to EBIT over the last year. When it comes to paying off debt, falling earnings are no more useful than sugary sodas are for your health. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting."", 'Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the most recent three years, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals recorded free cash flow worth 76% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.', ""While we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Regeneron Pharmaceuticals has net cash of US$7.93b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$4.4b, being 76% of its EBIT. So we are not troubled with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals's debt use. Over time, share prices tend to follow earnings per share, so if you're interested in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, you may well want to click here to check an interactive graph of its earnings per share history."", ""Of course, if you're the type of investor who prefers buying stocks without the burden of debt, then don't hesitate to discover our exclusive list of net cash growth stocks, today."", 'Have feedback on this article?

In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, Live Nation LYV and Amazon.com (AMZN).', 'Here is a synopsis of all five stocks.', 'Pinduoduo or Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock PDD Holdings is an Ireland-based Chinese e-commerce platform founded in 2015. Though PDD is much younger than its rivals like Alibaba Group (BABA) or VIP Shop Holdings (VIPS), PDD has gained significant popularity in a relatively short period, becoming one of the largest e-commerce companies in China.', 'Last quarter, PDD’s quarterly earnings grew 31% while revenue soared 89% year-over-year. In fact, for several quarters in a row, PDD has grown the top and bottom-line growth at a robust double-digit clip, far outpacing both its domestic and foreign industry group peers.', 'The main driver of growth is PDD’s wildly popular online marketplace Temu. Temu is PDD’s discount e-commerce platform, which leverages Chinese vendors to sell and ship directly to customers in the destination country. Because Temu cuts out the intermediary and takes advantage of low-cost labor and product inputs from China, the website can undercut other e-commerce websites like Alibaba’s AliExpress or Amazon (AMZN).', 'PDD’s websites also offer unique features that are unavailable on other mainstream e-commerce websites, including:', '· Users can form groups to purchase the same product together, allowing them to benefit from lower prices.', '· PDD incorporates gamification and social networking elements to engage users more than traditional websites.', '· Unlike other platforms, PDD is heavily focused on its mobile app, which is designed to be user-friendly and accessible.', 'Zacks Consensus Analyst Estimates predict that PDD’s rapid growth will continue well into 2024. Analysts anticipate double-digit earnings and revenue growth over the next few quarters.', 'It’s one thing to have high EPS expectations and a whole other thing to execute on those expectations. PDD has done the latter. Over the past 11 quarters, the discount e-commerce giant has surpassed expectations each quarter while handily beating expectations by 25% or more over the past three quarters.', 'After reporting earnings on November 28th, PDD shares launched higher by 18% on volume nearly three times the average. Such power and volume indicate that institutional investors are rushing to enter the stock. Further, because PDD has held its earnings gap and volume has dried up, it is a sign that investors with significant gains in the stock are unwilling to part with shares.', 'Finally, investors should not overlook PDD’s relative strength versus other Chinese stocks. While China’s economy and stock market have struggled, PDD has thrived. If China is to recover, PDD should see even more strength.', 'According to the Wall Street Journal, the Biden administration is weighing a plan to reduce tariffs on Chinese consumer products. Meanwhile, China recently approved the first Boeing (BA) 787 delivery since 2021. If tensions between the world’s two largest economies dissipate, it will be another bullish catalyst for PDD.', 'PDD has emerged as a force to be reckoned with in the Chinese and international e-commerce landscape, outpacing competitors with its innovative platform, Temu. With a focus on heavily discounted offerings, unique features like group buying and interactive elements, and a mobile-centric approach, PDD continues to experience robust growth in earnings and revenue. Expect shares to be higher in the next six to twelve months.', 'Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock Cisco is a leading multinational technology company specializing in networking hardware, software, and telecommunications solutions. Known for its extensive product portfolio, Cisco provides a range of networking equipment, including routers and switches, and software solutions for network management, security, and collaboration.', ""The company offers telecommunications equipment, such as IP phones and video conferencing systems, as well as data center technologies and cybersecurity solutions. Cisco's expertise extends to cloud services, Internet of Things (IoT), and it provides consulting, support, and training services. As a key player in the IT industry, Cisco plays a vital role in enabling connectivity, communication, and secure data management for businesses and organizations worldwide."", 'Nothing is more painful for an investor than being in a stock that is underperforming as the overall market is rising. Because 75% of stocks follow the general market’s direction, a major red flag for prospective CSCO investors should be its abhorrent price performance in 2023. While the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 ETF is up more than 50% year-to-date, CSCO shares are flat. It’s safe to presume that CSCO will underperform even more if US equities retreat at any point in 2024.', 'What’s behind Cisco’s underwhelming price action? Cisco’s product orders are set to decline by 20% due to elevated inventory levels at the company’s largest customers.', 'The troubling trend is expected to persist and hurt Cisco’s earnings performance over the next couple of quarters by diminishing top-line growth. Analysts agree – Cisco’s Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) is negative. According to our intensive 10-year back test at Zacks, when a company sports a negative ESP score combined with a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell), most stocks will miss on earnings and will underperform over the twelve months.', 'Cisco has been forced to offer discounts and deals in response to stiff competition from competitors like Arista Networks (ANET), Juniper Networks (JNPR), and Hewlett Packard (HPE).', 'Beyond the overall market direction and earnings estimates, the most critical factor that drives a stock’s price is its industry group. CSCO’s Computer – Networking industry, ranks 235 out of 252, putting it in the bottom 7% of all industries tracked by Zacks.', 'Cisco faces significant challenges that warrant investor caution. With a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell), the company has demonstrated relative weakness, lagging behind the market’s overall performance. Slowing growth, a cutthroat competitive landscape, and a weak industry group make CSCO shares an avoid at this juncture.', 'U.S. consumer confidence registered a bigger-than-expected jump in December, per the latest report from The Conference Board. The much-viewed Consumer Confidence Index hit 110.7 in the current month, significantly rising from a downwardly revised figure of 101.0 in November. The Present Situation Index rose to 148.5 from 136.5 in November.', 'More importantly, American consumers are feeling more secure about their prospects over the next six months, as the Expectations Index jumped to 85.6 in December, much better than November’s downwardly revised figure of 77.4. This significantly reduces the threat of an impending recession in the near term, as a reading below 80 generally indicates a recession.', 'The Federal Reserve’s heightened series of rate hikes, escalating from record-low levels in March 2022 to the current 5.25-5.50%, impacted growth-oriented companies, and small and medium-sized businesses.', 'However, at its Dec 13 meeting, the Federal Reserve kept the interest rate steady for the third straight time and signaled multiple rate cuts in 2024 due to slowing inflation.', 'The Fed is expected to keep a vigil on the inflation gauge before going for any cuts. It expects core inflation to decline to 3.2% in 2023, 2.4% in 2024 and 2.2% in 2025. Inflation is expected to hit the Federal Reserve’s 2% target in 2026.', 'The impressive jump in consumer confidence, both current and near term, reflects the benefits of cooling inflation and hopes of at least three rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve in 2024. This, along with strong retail sales (up 0.3% in November) and lower weekly jobless claims (down 19K per the Dec 14 release), reflects the resiliency of the U.S. economy.', 'According to National Retail Federation data, holiday spending is expected to grow 3-4% over 2022, which is consistent with the average annual holiday increase of 3.6% between 2010 and 2019.', 'In fact, higher consumer spending buoys GDP growth. Per a survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, on an annual-average-over-annual-average basis, real GDP is expected to increase 2.4% in 2023 and 1.7% in 2024. These annual projections are 0.3% and 0.4% higher than the estimates in the previous survey.', 'Despite chances of a bumpy ride in the first half of 2024, U.S. consumer confidence is expected to remain robust on the aforementioned factors. This presents strong growth opportunities for consumer discretionary and retail stocks in 2024.', 'Here, we select three stocks — Royal Caribbean Cruises, Live Nation and Amazon.com — which are well-positioned to benefit from robust consumer confidence in 2024.', 'Each of the above-mentioned companies currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a market cap of more than $10 billion.
