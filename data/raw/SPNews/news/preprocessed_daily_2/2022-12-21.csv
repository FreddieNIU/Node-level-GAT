4,2e281bbb-cea6-3771-8189-11211b379778,SCHW,2022-12-21,Should Schwab 1000 Index ETF (SCHK) Be on Your Investing Radar?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-1000-index-etf-schk-112011330.html,1671535211,STORY,"['SCHW', '^GSPC']","[If you're interested in broad exposure to the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market, look no further than the Schwab 1000 Index ETF (SCHK), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 10/11/2017.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $2.28 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Blend segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap BlendLarge cap companies usually have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.Typically holding a combination of both growth and value stocks, blend ETFs also demonstrate qualities seen in value and growth investments.CostsExpense ratios are an important factor in the return of an ETF and in the long term, cheaper funds can significantly outperform their more expensive counterparts, other things remaining the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.05%, making it one of the least expensive products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 1.60%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsWhile ETFs offer diversified exposure, which minimizes single stock risk, a deep look into a fund's holdings is a valuable exercise. And, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 26.50% of the portfolio. Healthcare and Financials round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 6.57% of total assets, followed by Microsoft Corp (MSFT) and Amazon Com Inc (AMZN).The top 10 holdings account for about 25.33% of total assets under management.Performance and RiskSCHK seeks to match the performance of the Schwab 1000 Index before fees and expenses. The Schwab 1000 Index is a float-adjusted market capitalization weighted index that includes the 1,000 largest stocks of publicly traded companies in the United States, with size being determined by market capitalization. The index is designed to be a measure of the performance of large- and mid-cap U.S. stocks.Story continuesThe ETF has lost about -20.36% so far this year and is down about -17.45% in the last one year (as of 12/20/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $34.56 and $46.85.The ETF has a beta of 1.02 and standard deviation of 25.31% for the trailing three-year period. With about 989 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab 1000 Index ETF carries a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 (Hold), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Thus, SCHK is a good option for those seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Blend area of the market. Investors might also want to consider some other ETF options in the space.The iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF (IVV) and the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) track a similar index. While iShares Core S&amp;P 500 ETF has $289.13 billion in assets, SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF has $364.32 billion. IVV has an expense ratio of 0.03% and SPY charges 0.09%.Bottom-LineAn increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

5,a8416c9d-92d6-3079-949d-0755a094c411,RRC,2022-12-21,Know Why Natural Gas Prices Ended 5.7% Higher Past Week,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/know-why-natural-gas-prices-130701161.html,1671541621,STORY,"['EQT', 'NG=F', 'RRC', 'CRK']","[The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a bigger-than-expected decrease in natural gas supplies. The encouraging inventory numbers, coupled with other factors, meant that futures rose week over week.In fact, the market has been kind to natural gas in 2022, with the commodity trading considerably higher year to date and hitting $10 for the first time since 2008. Natural gas stocks like Range Resources RRC, EQT Corporation EQT and Comstock Resources CRK have been some of the prime beneficiaries of the price appreciation.EIA Reports a Withdrawal Larger Than Market ExpectationsStockpiles held in underground storage in the lower 48 states fell 50 billion cubic feet (Bcf) for the week ended Dec 9, above the guidance of 46 Bcf decline per a survey conducted by The Wall Street Journal.However, the decrease was below last year’s pull of 83 Bcf for the same corresponding week and the five-year (2017-2021) average net shrinkage of 93 Bcf.The fourth draw of the winter heating season puts total natural gas stocks at 3,412 Bcf, which is 18 Bcf (0.5%) below the 2021 level at this time and 15 Bcf (0.4%) lower than the five-year average.The total supply of natural gas averaged 105.6 Bcf per day, up 0.2 Bcf per day on a weekly basis due to marginal increases in dry production and shipments from Canada.Meanwhile, daily consumption improved 2.2% to 118.2 Bcf from 115.6 Bcf in the previous week, mainly reflecting a stronger power burn and increased residential/commercial demand.Natural Gas Logs a Weekly GainNatural gas prices trended upward last week, following the higher-than-expected inventory draw. Futures for January delivery ended Friday at $6.60 on the New York Mercantile Exchange, rising around 5.7% from the previous week’s closing. The increase in natural gas realization — for the first time in three weeks — is also the result of forecasts for chillier weather.As is the norm with natural gas, changes in temperature and weather forecasts can lead to price swings. With heavy snowfall and frigid air, the latest models anticipate strong temperature-driven consumption in the near term (with extensive use of heaters across homes and businesses), which is a positive for prices.A stable demand catalyst in the form of continued strong LNG feedgas deliveries is also supporting natural gas. LNG shipments for export from the United States have been robust for months on the back of environmental reasons and record-high prices of the super-chilled fuel elsewhere.Now, with the Russia-Ukraine conflict, LNG has become even more coveted. As a matter of fact, earlier this year, the United States entered into a partnership with the EU to export additional LNG to wean the bloc off its dependence on Russian natural gas supplies. This means that LNG deliveries are poised to rise further, especially with squeezed natural gas supplies from Moscow to Europe, following leaks in the key Nord Stream pipeline.However, the protracted downtime associated with the fire breakout at the Freeport LNG export plant in Texas has drowned out some of the positives as of now. The Quintana, TX facility — responsible for around 15% of U.S. liquefaction capacity — was knocked offline by the Jun 8 blast and is expected to only partially restart by the end of December after several missed target dates. Consequently, some of the LNG cargoes due for export are likely to have been diverted to the domestic market despite huge demand abroad.Story continuesFinal ThoughtsDespite some hiccups in between, the natural gas market is still up more than 75% so far this year. While fundamental indicators continue to suggest strong price levels, the natural gas market is currently quite unpredictable and spooked by the sudden changes in weather. As such, investors are rather unsure of what to do. As of now, the lingering uncertainty over the fuel means that they should preferably opt for fundamentally strong stocks like Range Resources, EQT and Comstock Resources.Range Resources: The upstream firm has a strong footing in the prolific Appalachian Basin. In the gas-rich resource, RRC has huge inventories of low-risk drilling sites that are likely to provide production for several decades.Range Resources has a projected earnings growth rate of 151% for the current year. Valued at around $6.4 billion, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company reported EPS of $1.37 in the third quarter, reflecting a 0.7% surprise over consensus. RRC shares have climbed 44.1% this year.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.EQT: EQT is primarily an explorer and producer of natural gas, with a primary focus on the Appalachian Basin in Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia. In terms of average daily sales volumes, EQT is the largest natural gas producer in the domestic market.The company has an expected earnings growth rate of 335.9% for the current year. EQT’s expected EPS growth rate for three to five years is currently 56%, which compares favorably with the industry's growth rate of 28.7%. EQT — valued at around $13.7 billion — has soared 69.9% this year.Comstock Resources: The company is active in the Haynesville shale in North Louisiana and East Texas — a premier natural gas basin. As of now, CRK has a projected earnings growth rate of 212.1% for the current year.Comstock Resources, with a market capitalization of $3.5 billion, enjoys a Zacks Value and Growth Style Score of A each, and an overall VGM Score of A.

6,bc5b13a1-b3c4-37bc-84df-db3ded4b3faa,NUE,2022-12-21,"A Recession Shield That Tesla, Worksport and Nucor Seem To Have In Common",Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recession-shield-tesla-worksport-nucor-203211654.html,1671568331,STORY,"['NUE', 'TSLA', 'WKSP']","[Bloomberg Radio podcast brought together social media, EVs, energy markets and steel in its December 16th podcast. With the twilight zone getting worse and fears of recessions upon the world, we are once again reminded that future is promised to no one, but that isn’t stopping Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA), Worksport (NASDAQ: WKSP) and Nucor (NYSE: NUE) from moving forward and going full speed ahead.TwitterMusk is the heart and lungs of Tesla Inc, but the same cannot be said for his newest social media adventure, Twitter (NASDAQ: TWTR). When 57.5% of poll respondents voted for him to step down as CEO, the billionaire broke silence by stating that only paid Twitter Blue subscribers will be able to vote in future policy-related polls due to multiple suggestions that the results were skewed by fake accounts.TeslaEven Musk’s bright spot, Tesla, got downgraded by Wall Street on Monday due to his Twitter actions. On Friday, Mr Musk was condemned by the United Nations and European Union over the platform’s decision to suspend a number of journalists.The UN tweeted that media freedom is ""not a toy"", while the EU took a step further and threatened the company with sanctions. It seems „the bird is not freed“ after all as Musk tweeted when his turbulent takeover of the social media platform was finalized in October.Consequently, Oppenheimer &amp; Co. downgraded its rating on Tesla CEO because of the risks posed by the billionaire’s double CEO rules, more precisely the ownership and management of Twitter that is thought by even some of his supporters to be harming Tesla and destroying the brand.Reasons for concernAlthough Tesla continues to dominate the EV market, taking up as much as 65.4% of the EV sales, but its share has dropped from 2021’s 68.2% in 2021 and 2020’s 79.4%. With the market growing, Tesla is still growing its vehicle sales despite its loss of market share. But, significant setbacks seem to be on the horizon as the Twitter-effect comes into play.Story continuesTesla failed to meet Q3 estimates by delivering 343,000 vehicles which is below the anticipated 358,000, but the company blamed the highly challenging logistics environment. Year-to-date, the company’s shares dropped 62.5%, with NASDAQ overall falling only 33.4%.WorksportAs pressure for green energy gets intensified, an innovative company such as Worksport (NASDAQ: WKSP) is bound to benefit with its revolutionary solar-powered tonneau covers and mobile energy storage systems. During his Bloombert Radio interview, Worksport’s CEO Steven Rossi noted that pickups are recession-proof on the consumer sales side because they are bought both during the good and during the bad times, placing Worksport in an enviable position. Moreover, the company's market is far greater than pickup truck drivers as its products appeal to anyone who can benefit from a power generator on a stormy day or has the need to power a camp site. Although even Worksport is not immune to supply chain issues, higher prices and delays, its potential to capitalize on the green energy shift remains intact.NucorThought of by many as the “best steelmaker in America,” Nucor showed it can post solid earnings results despite the Federal Reserve’s tightening with its stock up over 15% year to date. CNBC’s Cramer predicted Nucor will be a huge beneficiary of the over $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill and therefore, 2023 could be good year ahead.On December 19th, it revealed that California Steel Industries, Inc. (CSI) will build a continuous galvanizing line at its mill in Fontana, California over 30 months in an investment valued at $370 million.In simple words, these companies show that creating value and making a case for sustainability creates a powerful shield which is a great asset at all times, especially in case of a probable recession ahead.See more from BenzingaMobile Games Are Being Dethroned In the Post-Pandemic WorldGlobal Semiconductor Race Is Turning Into a WarDon't miss real-time alerts on your stocks - join Benzinga Pro for free!

The industry has gained 2.5% year to date. Improved pricing, prudent underwriting, increased exposure, streamlined operations, a wider global presence and a solid capital position have helped the industry.Banking on strong fundamentals and benefiting from a favorable macro backdrop, W.R.

Per December Economic Projections of the Fed, GDP in 2022 is estimated to improve 0.5%, while the unemployment rate is expected to be 3.7%.Despite an above-average hurricane season, continued increases in pricing, reinsurance programs and favorable reserve development helped non-life insurers sail through.Swiss Re estimated insured losses from natural catastrophes of $35 million for the first half of 2022, while Munich Re estimated losses of $65 billion, with slightly less than half insured. Per a report published in LAW360, AM Best estimated the net income of U.S. property and casualty insurers to decline 17% year over year to $31.4 billion in the first half of 2022.Story continuesGlobal commercial insurance prices rose for 20 straight quarters though the magnitude slowed down over the last seven quarters, per Marsh Global Insurance Market Index.Better pricing ensures improved premiums and prudent claims payment. Per Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase sixfold to $722 billion by 2030. China and North America should account for more than two-thirds of the global market, per the report. Per Willis Towers Watson's 2021 Insurance Marketplace Realities spring update report, except for one, 26 lines should witness a price rise, while seven lines should witness a mix or flat increase.The insurance industry is rate sensitive. The interest rate environment has started to improve. The Fed has already made six hikes in 2022, with more to come. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail non-life insurers and life insurers.Increased awareness following the pandemic continues to support the life insurance market. However, according to LIMRA's Second Quarter U.S. Individual Life Insurance Sales Survey, the number of policies sold decreased 9% in the first half of 2022 though the total net premium rose 11%. Concerns over inflation and a slowdown in the economy have likely weighed on the sales figures, per the report.Nevertheless, a solid surplus level continues to aid insurers in pursuing strategic mergers and acquisitions to gain market share, expand in niche areas, and diversify operations into new business lines and geography.The industry is undergoing accelerated digitalization. Increased use of technology like blockchain, artificial intelligence, advanced analytics, telematics, cloud computing robotic process automation, Chatbot and RoboAdvisory, and insurtech solutions continue to expedite business operations and save costs.Can These Stocks Retain the Bull Run Next Year?Per December Economic Projections of the Fed, GDP in 2023 is pegged to grow 0.5%, while the unemployment rate is pinned to be 4.6%. As the insurance industry is an important contributor to the country's GDP, it is well-poised for growth, given the economic expansion.At its December meeting, Fed predicted to take the interest rate to 5.1% in 2023 to combat its expected 3.1% inflation. Insurers, being the beneficiaries of the rising rate environment, are positioned to generate better investment results.The improved pricing environment should continue through 2023, albeit at a slower pace. Better pricing, improved underwriting standards and streamlined operations should continue to fuel premium. Per Deloitte Insights, the life insurance premium is estimated to increase 1.9% in 2023. The report also stated that trends like commercial lines witnessing growth at a faster pace than personal lines, homeowners' premiums improving better than personal auto are likely to continue in 2023.Insurers should continue to invest heavily in technology to improve scale and efficiencies, while M&amp;A should be on the rise as more insurers seek growth through expansion.Picks for Better ReturnWith the help of the Zacks Stock Screener, we have selected three insurance stocks that rallied this year and are poised to retain the momentum next year.

If you want to see more undervalued wide moat stocks to invest in, go directly to 5 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Invest in.Wide moat stocks are stocks with substantial competitive advantages that keep competitors from affecting their business that much.Examples of wide moat stocks would be a company with a monopoly that's very difficult for any competitor to gain market share from.Another example of a wide moat stock would be a company with substantial network effects and scale.Given competitors have a difficult time gaining market share, wide moat stocks tend to be profitable. In terms of their industry, they tend to have higher margins than their competitors given their leading position.With their earnings, wide moat companies use the profits generated to either pay dividends, buy back shares, or to invest the capital back into their existing businesses or new ventures.As a result of their steady businesses, some of the leading wide moat businesses have increased their annual dividends for 25 years or more.Undervalued StocksUndervalued stocks are stocks of companies that are trading below their intrinsic value.A company's intrinsic value is basically what the company is really worth and not the market capitation the market is currently assigning it.In bull markets, quality undervalued companies can be rare because valuations are often fairly high through the market given market optimism.In bear markets, however, quality undervalued companies can be more common than during bull markets because lower valuations are more common.2022The market has decreased given the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times this year to fight inflation. Although October and November's inflation results were better than expected, the U.S. central bank has signaled it will raise interest rates even further next year as well.As of December 19, the S&amp;P 500 is down 20.41% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has retreated 10.46% year to date and the Nasdaq Composite has declined 33.39% year to date.Story continuesGiven the substantial increase in interest rates, many economists think there will likely be a recession next year as a result. If the recession is moderate to severe, many companies might not meet earnings estimates and the broader market could decline further.If the broader market declines, the leading undervalued wide moat stocks could retreat further in the near term. In the long term, however, the leading stocks could have considerable upside.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Amazonchristian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 11 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Invest in, we selected 11 stocks with wide moats and substantial competitive advantages that arguably trade below their intrinsic value.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, also check out 12 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.11 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Invest in11. State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) is a leading asset manager that is a pioneer in ETF and index investing whose shares current trade for a forward P/E ratio of 9.4. Given the company's competitive advantages such as its strong brand and scale that give it a wide moat, State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) is arguably undervalued. Analysts estimate the company will earn $7.19 per share in 2022, $8.16 per share in 2023, and $9.16 per share in 2024.Alongside Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc.

BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) is the largest asset manager in the world with assets under management of around $10 trillion. Given the company's AUM, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) has a wide moat considering its scale that allows it to realize higher margins than many of its competitors.Although the stock trades for a forward P/E ratio of 20.25, the leading asset manager has substantial AUM growth potential with the expected growth in ETFs in the future. If it maintains its market share in ETFs, the company's earnings per share also has substantial growth potential.Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 46 owned shares of BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) at the end of Q3, ranking the stock #10 on our list of 11 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Invest in.9. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is Wall Street's leading bank with the best brand name and many of the financial sector's best employees. Given the intellectual capital and the bank's already immense resources, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.

(NYSE:GS) currently trades for a forward P/E ratio of 9.22 which is pretty attractive in the long term given the bank's competitive advantages.8. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77As one of the big four banks in the United States, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) has substantial scale that affords the company wider margins than many of its smaller competitors. Given the higher interest rates, the bank has an opportunity to earn more in terms of net interest margin. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is also increasing its capital returns.

Despite the positives of higher interest rates and the company making good progress on reducing expenses and regulatory consent orders, Wells Fargo shares have fallen one-third from their highs earlier this year to roughly 6.5x our estimate of normalized earnings power, and the stock ended the quarter at ~1x next year’s tangible book value. We find this is far too cheap for a strong banking franchise capable of tangible returns in the low-to-mid teens across business cycles.7. Citigroup Inc.

The company’s bullish long-term growth strategy buoys optimism on the stock. Yet, stiff competition in Edwards Lifesciences’ TAVR business continues to ail the company. Persistent forex woes also do not bode well. The company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Edwards Lifesciences registered year-over-year growth in both earnings and revenues during the third quarter. The company registered strong underlying growth across all product groups. However, a slower-than-expected recovery of the U.S. hospital staffing trend and COVID-19 restrictions in Japan marred growth. Adjusted EPS grew despite aggressive investment in R&amp;D and commercial infrastructure to support new therapies.Critical Care sales were up 3% on an underlying basis in the third quarter of 2022. The sales growth was driven by increased adoption of the broad portfolio of smart recovery products, including FloTrac and ClearSight sensors with unique hypotension prediction index algorithm. Additionally, demand for the HemoSphere monitoring platform remains strong.Edwards Lifesciences Corporation PriceEdwards Lifesciences Corporation PriceEdwards Lifesciences Corporation price | Edwards Lifesciences Corporation QuoteEdwards Lifesciences expects full-year 2022 underlying sales growth in the mid-single-digit range on the back of strength in demand for products used in more intense surgeries.In the third quarter, the company’s Surgical Structural Heart sales improved 8.2% on an underlying basis. The company continues to witness strong momentum of the RESILIA portfolio globally as it bolsters the overall body of evidence, including four abstracts recently presented at the European Association for Cardiothoracic Surgery Annual Meeting in Milan.Edwards Lifesciences expects 2022 underlying sales growth in the mid-single-digit range, driven by market growth and the adoption of premium technologies.On the flip side, Edwards Lifesciences’ revenues and earnings per share for the third quarter missed the respective Zacks Consensus Estimate. U.S. TAVR sales were impacted by slower-than-expected improvement in hospital staffing and temporary contrast agent shortages. Selling, general and administrative expenses rose 3.5% year over year, driven by the resumption of in-person commercial activities. These developments drove operating costs by 10%, building pressure on the company’s bottom line.The choppy market conditions due to the continued foreign exchange impact and COVID-related hospital staffing issues are concerning. The company lowered its sales outlook for full-year 2022, taking these macroeconomic challenges into account.Story continuesIn the past year, Edwards Lifesciences has underperformed its industry. The stock has lost 39.8% compared with the 23.5% fall of the industry.Key PicksA few better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that investors can consider are ShockWave Medical, Inc. SWAV, Orthofix Medical Inc. OFIX and Merit Medical System MMSI.ShockWave Medical, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present, has an estimated growth rate of 33.1% for 2023.

The confluence of viral infections is pressuring pediatric health care facilities as well as suppliers of common cold and flu treatments, such as those that treat fever and pain.Walgreens told Yahoo Finance that as a result of the skyrocketing demand, it's limited online purchases.""Retailers nationwide are experiencing supplier fulfillment challenges due to increased demand of over-the-counter pediatric fever reducing products,"" the company said in a statement. ""While Walgreens continues to have products to support our customers and patients, we have put into effect an online only purchase limit of 6 per online transaction to prevent excess purchasing behavior,"" the company said in a statement.""For customers looking for items, our website updates with the latest available store inventory information frequently throughout the day,"" the company added.CVS has limited purchases to two pain relief medications per purchase both online and in stores.""We’re committed to meeting our customers’ needs and are working with our suppliers to ensure continued access to these items,"" the company said in a statement.A surge in flu and respiratory illnesses are creating medication shortages, including this South Florida pharmacy with no children's Tylenol in stock on Friday, Dec. 9, 2022.

Canadian pharmacies began limiting supplies last month and have increased imports as a result.In a recent interview, White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said that supply has increased, but ""the challenge is demand"" amid an unusual season of respiratory illnesses.Johnson &amp; Johnson, meanwhile, said in a statement that it was not ""experiencing widespread shortages of Children’s Tylenol or Children's Motrin."" It added that while it recognizes there may be shortages at some stores, ""we...are doing everything we can to make sure people have access to the products they need, including maximizing our production capacity, running our sites 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and continuously shipping out product.""Haleon declined to comment and redirected a Yahoo Finance media request to the Consumer Healthcare Products Association.CHPA issued a statement on Monday that reiterated manufacturers were running 24 hours a day to meet demand, and that there wasn't a widespread shortage.""However, with demand for children’s pain and fever medicines reaching unprecedented levels following this early and severe flu season (along with cases of RSV and COVID), we understand why some retailers have adjusted to impose limits on purchases...sales of pediatric internal analgesics are up 65% compared to the same time last year,"" the statement said.CHPA also noted that flu cases are on the decline, according to the latest national data.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

The company now has settlement agreements with all 50 states, including four states that previously settled with the company, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and three other U.S. territories, that are intended to resolve substantially all opioids-related lawsuits brought by state and local governments against Walmart. The participation exceeded the 43 states that were required to join the nationwide settlement framework by Dec. 15 for it to move forward. The settlement will take effect if a sufficient number of cities and counties also join.Walmart believes these settlements are in the best interest of all parties and will provide significant aid to communities across the country in the fight against the opioid crisis, with aid reaching state and local governments faster than any other nationwide opioid settlement to date, subject to satisfying all settlement requirements. Walmart strongly disputes the allegations in these matters, and these settlements do not include any admission of liability. Walmart will continue to vigorously defend the company against any lawsuit not resolved through these settlements.Walmart is helping fight the opioid crisis and is proud of its pharmacists, who help patients understand the risks about opioid prescriptions. The company has adopted many approaches to fighting the opioid crisis as part of its industry-leading Opioid Stewardship program.

One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.Looking back five years, both Nordstrom's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 6.8% per year. Readers should note that the share price has fallen faster than the EPS, at a rate of 19% per year, over the period. This implies that the market is more cautious about the business these days. The low P/E ratio of 8.09 further reflects this reticence.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that Nordstrom has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Nordstrom will grow revenue in the future.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. We note that for Nordstrom the TSR over the last 5 years was -61%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveThe total return of 20% received by Nordstrom shareholders over the last year isn't far from the market return of -21%. So last year was actually even worse than the last five years, which cost shareholders 10% per year. It will probably take a substantial improvement in the fundamental performance for the company to reverse this trend. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Nordstrom better, we need to consider many other factors.

The stock is the top trending ticker on Yahoo Finance as of 5:30 a.m. ET.But the real standout from Nike's fiscal second quarter was the company noticeably working down its excess inventory — caused earlier this year by the economic pullback — compared to three months ago. It's an issue that has plagued profit margins (due to Nike aggressively liquidating merchandise) and the stock price, analysts have contended.Nike's inventory fell 3% sequentially, spurred by a high-single-digit percentage drop in units. Total inventory units are down by a double-digit percentage compared to the first fiscal quarter.Management told analysts on an earnings call it continues to focus on clearing inventory, particularly through off-price retail stores. Further progress is expected into calendar year 2023, including a more cautious approach to buying new inventory.""We believe the inventory peak is behind us actions as we're taking in the marketplace are working,"" Nike CEO John Donahoe said.The inventory improvement sets the stage for better profit margins for Nike in coming quarters, provided the global economy doesn't fall off a cliff.Yahoo Finance Analysis: Nike's EarningsThe GoodSales, gross profit margins, and earnings beat analyst estimates.Inventory levels fell in units sequentially.Management called out strong online sales in November.Sales strength has continued into December, execs said on the conference call.Fiscal-year sales now seen up by a low-teens percentage, up from a low-double-digit percentage previously.The Not So GoodInventory still increased 43% year over year.Gross profit margin fell 300 basis points year over year due to increased markdowns.Fiscal year gross profit margins still seen falling 200 to 250 basis points year over year.Sales in Greater China declined 10% year over year.Story continuesWhat Wall Street Is Saying""We believe Nike's 2Q performance proves the brand remains strong, margin drivers are intact (Direct to Consumer / Digital) and global demand is healthy. Looking ahead, we expect inventory and China-related issues to subside, driving margin improvements. We move our estimates higher and recommend purchasing Nike shares and selling Lululemon shares."" -Jefferies Randal Konik (Buy rating; $140 price target)""Going forward, we expect GM guidance to again prove conservative and flag that unlike the majority of retail seeing the pandemic revenue pull-forward weigh on top-line, NKE's seeing material N.A. strength, with wholesale an interestingly positive call-out this quarter.

Because it is a market weighted index, companies with larger market capitalizations make up more of the index than smaller companies do.Considering that some tech companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange have grown into some of the largest in the world, technology accounts for a significant percentage of the index's weight.As a percentage, technology companies account for a bigger percentage of the NASDAQ index than they do for other notable indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&amp;P 500.While the NASDAQ is known for being technology heavy, the index also includes companies in other industries as well.Blue Chip Companies Some of the technology companies listed on the NASDAQ and some of the companies in other industries listed on the index have done well over time given their strong businesses.With competitive advantages and growth, some of those leading businesses listed on the NASDAQ have increased their earnings per share significantly and the stock prices of those companies have done well in the long run.20222022 has been a challenging year for the market as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates seven times to fight inflation. Although inflation has been lower than expected in October and November, many analysts expect the U.S. central bank to continue to raise rates further next year. As a result, many economists think there could be a recession next year.Given the headwinds, the NASDAQ index has declined over 33% year to date while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has retreated slightly over 10% and the S&amp;P 500 has fallen over 20%.Story continuesWith the decline, some quality companies listed on the NASDAQ are arguably trading below their intrinsic values in the long term.

34,b1855ac9-68ad-3bee-b9b4-ffc3bbaab829,MGM,2022-12-21,Global Partners and MGM Resorts have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/global-partners-mgm-resorts-highlighted-124012095.html,1671540012,STORY,"['GLP', 'MGM', 'AIRG', 'TESS']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – December 20, 2022 – Zacks Equity Research shares Global Partners GLP as the Bull of the Day and MGM Resorts MGM as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Airgain, Inc. AIRG, Kaleyra, Inc. KLR and TESSCO Technologies Inc. TESS.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Global Partners is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that is an adaptive distribution energy company. Global Partner's focus is to source low-cost energy in bulk and then transport products through its vertically integrated adaptive distribution network to wholesale, commercial and retail customers.Despite the recent pullback in crude oil, the stock is trading just under its 2022 highs. The relative strength in the name is very evident, which signals further gains in 2023. Additionally, a recent earnings report and surging earnings estimates is bringing more attention to the name.More About GLPGlobal Partners was incorporated in 2005 and is headquartered in Waltham, MA. The company focuses on the regions of New England, New York and the Mid-Atlantic. Global employs over 2400 people and has a market cap of $1.1 Billion.The company has its hand in all aspects of the energy markets. They purchase, sell, gather, blend, store, and transport gasoline and gasoline blendstocks, distillates, residual oil, renewable fuels, crude oil, and propane to wholesalers, retailers, and commercial customers.The stock has a Zacks Style Score of ""A"" in Growth, Momentum and Value. Global Partners currently pays a 7.5% dividend.Earnings Momentum On November 4th, GLP reported a 135% EPS beat for Q3. Earnings came in at $3.12 v the $0.86 a year ago. Revenues came in at $4.3 billion v the $3.32 billion last year. EBITDA climbed to $168.5M from $79.2M last year.The Gasoline Distribution and Station Operations segment performed well in Q3.  The company saw increased activity at its convenience stores and higher retail fuel margins year-over-year.Story continuesManagement commented that for the Wholesale segment, fuel inventory was managed effectively despite sustained backwardation in the gasoline and distillates markets. They added that the Commercial segment saw a year-over-year increase in bunkering activity.The earnings beat was the fifth in a row and the eighth out of the last ten quarters. Since that streak began, the stock is up over 130%.Estimates RisingAfter the big earnings report, analysts started to take estimates higher across all time frames.For the current quarter, numbers have been taken 197% higher over the last 60 days, from $0.47 to $1.40. For the current year, they have gone from $7.17 to $9.88, a 38% rise, over that same time frame.This is a steady improvement that will continue into next year. Over the last 60 days, next year's numbers have gone from $2.91 to $3.20.The Technical Take The relative strength in the name as crude oil prices head lower is telling. Investors are buying this name and anticipate the stock is heading back to the 2014 all-time highs of $45.75.For those looking to buy pullbacks, the moving averages have been fairly reliable. While the 200-day MA has cracked twice, the bulls reclaimed that level and the stock continues its march higher. The 50-day has been holding since October and the 21-day MA has been short-term support for a majority of November.The current 200-day is just under $28 and would likely find support it markets sold off. The 50-day $30.50 is one to watch for really bullish investors as the stock might be too strong to see a big sell off below the $30 level.Upside Fibonacci targets drawn from the COVID sell off are $41.25 and $62.50In Summary Global Partners offers investors an opportunity to get that energy exposure and get paid a hefty dividend. The company has posted consecutive quarters of strong cash flows and is looking to increase its scale through acquisitions.In 2022, stocks showing relative strength typically go on to outperform the market. There is no reason to think that 2023 will be any different and being invested in the energy space will likely continue to reap rewards.Look for GLP to close out the year strong and be a top performer in 2023.Bear of the Day:MGM Resorts is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that owns and operates casino, hotel and entertainment resorts in the United States and Macau. The company's resort portfolio incorporates 30 unique hotel offerings, including some of the most familiar resort brands in the industry such as Bellagio, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay and The Mirage.About the Company MGM is headquartered in Las Vegas, Nevada. The company was incorporated in 1986 and employs 52,000 people.  MGM operates through three segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and MGM China.As a percentage of revenue in 2021, the Las Vegas Strip was 49%, Regional Operations was 35% and MGM China was 12.5%. Management and other operations were 3.5%.MGM is valued at $13.5 billion and has a Forward PE of 28. The company holds Zacks Style Scores of ""B"" in Value but ""D"" in Growth. The stock pays a small dividend of 0.03%.Q3 Earnings The company reported EPS on November 2nd, missing expectations by 732%. EPS came in at -$1.39 v the $0.22 expected. Revenues beat, coming it at $342B v the $326B expected. The loss was due to a $1.2B expense due to new Macau gaming laws.Outside of that charge, the quarter was the company's best in history. Las Vegas Strip RevPar was $210 vs $148 last year. Occupancy was up to 93% v the 82% last year. However, China Net revenues were down to $87M v the $289M last year.While the company is optimistic about operations like BetMGM and strong domestic bookings into 2023, analysts are dropping their estimates.EstimatesOver the last 60 days, current quarter estimates have fallen from $0.20 to a negative $1.31. While they have ticked higher for next quarter, the current year has been lowered as well. Over the last 60 days, we see a 70% drop for that time frame, falling from $4.51 to $1.29.While these numbers have a lot to do with the Macau expense, next year is falling as well. Analysts have lowered their estimates from $0.70 to $0.24 over the last 60 days, but we have seen an uptick over the last 30 days from $0.04 to $0.24. Technical TakeThe stock is still trading above the 200-day moving average, but a break below that $35 level might cause some selling. While the stock has fallen 20% on the year, it has traded sideways since August.Investors should be cautious under $35 and seek value in the low $30s. A move above $39 and the bulls take back control of the stock.In SummaryMGM has a great core business, but complications in Macau gaming laws are hitting their numbers. Additionally, China's zero-COVID policies continue to hamper its business.While the action in Vegas has been strong, margins are starting to look like an issue. If the customer starts to struggle, some of MGM's resorts might as well.

Recovery initiatives in the region were dull in 2021, as most countries maintained tight border restrictions. However, the report by World Travel &amp; Tourism Council demonstrates that the Asia-Pacific is forecasted to bridge the gap this year, and travel revenue contribution to the economy will increase by nearly 71%. Travel restrictions were first lifted in India and Australia, followed by Malaysia, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian countries. Later, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also opened up. The report suggests ongoing gains to Asia-Pacific’s travel sector in 2023, and the year after that is also expected to bring positive growth in the industry. By 2025, travel revenue will provide 32% more to the Asian GDP than it did pre-pandemic.As per a Bloomberg report dated December 13, China’s swift reopening and easing of Covid Zero policies has initiated a solid rebound in the world’s largest domestic air travel market, which is a positive catalyst for the ‘Big Three’ Chinese airlines, which have suffered billions of dollars in losses since the beginning of the pandemic.

This year, the index is set to have fallen for eight out of 12 months, on a par only with 2008 for the number of monthly losses in a calendar year on record.In Europe, shares pared some of the previous day's declines, thanks in large part to a rally in sportswear stocks, after Nike , the world's largest sportswear company, beat quarterly revenue estimates. U.S. index futures rose between 0.3%-0.5%, suggesting some of this strength may carry through to the Wall Street open later.On Tuesday, the Bank of Japan (BOJ) widened its trading band for 10-year government bond yields from 25 basis points (bps) either side of zero to 50 bps.That triggered a leap in the yen, which had spent most of the year sliding because of Japan's low yields, as well as selling in Japan's stock market and a selloff for bonds around the world.The decision by the BOJ, the last dovish bastion in the central bank world, has added to concern among investors about how the impact of rising interest rates and persistent inflation will affect the global economy.Fund managers are adopting an extremely cautious approach to the start of 2023 and, as such, trading conditions are thin and highly volatile.“We think recessions are coming in the US and Europe but its very hard to gauge the amplitude of these recessions right now.

We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 63% ownership. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$9.0b. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 10% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements. Hence, if weakness in Morgan Stanley's share price continues, institutional investors may feel compelled to sell the stock, which might not be ideal for individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Morgan Stanley, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Morgan Stanley ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Morgan Stanley?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Morgan Stanley. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Morgan Stanley's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Morgan Stanley is not owned by hedge funds. Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 22% of shares outstanding. State Street Global Advisors, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.2% of common stock, and The Vanguard Group, Inc. holds about 6.7% of the company stock.Story continuesWe also observed that the top 7 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of Morgan StanleyWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Morgan Stanley in their own names. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$376m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in Morgan Stanley. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipPublic companies currently own 22% of Morgan Stanley stock. We can't be certain but it is quite possible this is a strategic stake. The businesses may be similar, or work together.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Morgan Stanley better, we need to consider many other factors. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

Gold is the most smuggled mineral.With continued high international demand, Zimbabwe is projected to become one of the world’s largest lithium exporters, with the government hoping to meet 20% of the world’s total demand for lithium when it fully exploits its known lithium resources.Mineral exports account for about 60% (pdf) of Zimbabwe’s export earnings while the mining sector contributes 16% to its GDP, according to a 2021 mining report by the London School of Economics.Zimbabwe’s lithium export ban“No lithium-bearing ores, or unbeneficiated lithium whatsoever, shall be exported from Zimbabwe to another country except under the written permit of the minister,” mining minister Winston Chitando says in the circular.However, according to deputy mining minister Polite Kambamura, mining companies that are building processing plants will be excluded from the directive.“If we continue exporting raw lithium we will go nowhere. We want to see lithium batteries being developed in the country,” he said. “We have done this in good faith for the growth of industry.”Why lithium is in high demandAs the world shifts to clean energy, especially electric mobility, lithium has become a critical component in high energy-density rechargeable battery manufacture due to its high electrochemical potential.Story continuesBattery makers anticipate that lithium-ion batteries will keep dominating the industry as they are now 30 times cheaper than when they first came to the market in the early 1990s.However, recent demand for the mineral has seen its price soar by more than 180% in the past year as per the Benchmark Minerals’ Lithium Price index. Lithium carbonate spot prices in China, world’s biggest EV market, climbed to a record $84,000 per ton in November.Zimbabwe is losing billions of dollars in the mining sectorZimbabwe’s has the largest lithium deposits in Africa. The Bikita mine, located 308 kms south of the capital Harare has the country’s largest lithium mines with reserves of 10.8 million tons of lithium ore. “The Arcadia Lithium Mine is expected to reach an annual production of 2.5 million tons of lithium ore after the mine is deployed, which would roughly equate to $3 billion in exports,” says the survey.In 2015, it was estimated that Zimbabwe lost $12 billion through illegal trade involving multinational companies from rich countries in the mining sector. Such funds are enough to clear its foreign debt of $13.7 billion.Western companies have been accused of exploiting Africa’s lithium mines and leaving the countries poorer only to come back and sell them processed minerals in the form of smartphones, car batteries, and other rechargeable electronics.More from QuartzRestaurant menu screens are looking at you to decide what you might want to eatSign up for Quartz's Newsletter.

You can skip our outlook of the equity market and go directly to the 5 Best Stocks To Invest In Right Now.The equities markets around the world have been in a slump in 2022 over concerns of an impending recession and rising interest rates. The S&amp;P 500 index is down 20% YTD, reflecting the challenging environment both companies and investors had to face in 2022. The current market environment is difficult for individual investors who favor stock-picking as picking and choosing a stock in this market is extremely difficult as the market heads south. This is where the benefits of having your funds invested with a hedge fund or following the positions of large successful hedge funds can reap the rewards for investors.As the name suggests, hedge funds are “hedged” against several risks, which an individual investor might not consider or remain oblivious to. Most hedge funds perform better in bear markets than in bull markets. Hedge funds employ different strategies to protect the value of the assets under management and provide returns to investors. One of the most popular kinds of hedge funds across the globe is the long-short equity fund. The total asset size of long-short equity funds in the world is estimated to be $683 billion. However, investors have been taking money out of these long-short equity funds over the past few years. In 2022 till August, $25 billion have been taken out by investors from long-short equity funds.Funds that employ various strategies across different asset classes, often called “multi-strategy funds,” are gaining popularity around the world. The difference in asset-under-management of long-short equity funds and multi-strategy funds has come down to approximately $27 billion from $235 billion in 2021. Multi-strategy funds can improve investors' access to new investment methods, reducing the need for time-consuming due diligence. Similarly, employing a single strategy, especially during periods of high volatility, is not wise, which is why multi-strategy hedge funds are gaining popularity.Story continuesWhy Hedge Funds Win and Why Should We Pay Attention to Their Stock Picks?A latest report by Bloomberg cements the argument which says that major hedge funds have an edge in the market over average investors due to the sheer scale of the money, resources and talent these institutions have. The report says that despite the economic volatility, giants in the $4 trillion hedge fund industry were able to post double-digit gains. These notable names include Citadel and Millennium Management.Bloomberg specifically mentioned the role resources play in this performance:""Giants from Citadel to Millennium Management produced double-digit gains as their army of traders once again earned steady returns.""The report also noted that a whopping 95% of the capital allocated to multi-strategy investment firms posted gains in 2022 through September, while nine in every 10 dollars invested in macro hedge funds gained 23.7% on average in the same period. Hedge funds on average lost 9% in this period, while the S&amp;P index fell 25%.Given this outperformance, in this article, we will focus on the top picks of over 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. These stocks are the most popular among the elite hedge funds, as of the end of the third quarter.Best Stocks To Invest In Right Now According to Hedge Funds12. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 115Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a streaming video-on-demand platform that provides original and third-party digital video content to consumers. It is the largest subscription-based SVOD platform, with over 220 million subscribers.On December 9, 2022, John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen, increased his price target on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) to $405 while keeping an Outperform rating on the stock. The analyst named the company as his top large-cap pick for 2023.As per Insider Monkey’s database, 115 hedge funds remained bullish on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) at the end of the third quarter. Fisher Asset Management had the biggest stake in the company at the end of the third quarter.Harding Loevner, an asset management company, mentioned Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) mustered a modest recovery as the market Allocation Effect: 0.3 mulled the potential of its new lower-priced ad-supported subscription model to drive revenue growth and reduce its dependency on continued heavy investment in content to attract and retain viewers.11. salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 117Founded in 1999, salesforce.com, inc.

(NYSE:CRM) to $225 while keeping an Outperform rating on the stock. According to the analyst, the company’s Q3 results were impressive, and the management raised its 2023 operating margin guidance to 20.7% from prior guidance of 20.4%, which is a positive sign.According to Insider Monkey’s database, 117 hedge funds held shares of the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Fisher Asset Management was the most bullish fund on the company’s stock at the end of Q3 2022.Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC, an investment advisor, mentioned salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:We sold Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to reduce our weighting in the Information Technology sector. Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.10. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 126PayPal Holdings, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading technology provider in telecommunications. computing and services. Apple’s iOS operating system is the company’s unique intellectual property and competitive strength. This software drives extremely tight engagement with consumers and enterprises. The engagement is fostering the growing purchase of high-margin services like music, apps, and apple pay. Apple’s shares detracted from performance as management lowered its guidance for the second quarter due to headwinds from the war in Ukraine, adverse foreign currency shifts, and dampened consumer demand associated with the coronavirus in China. Additionally, many investors were concerned that lockdowns implemented to curtail the spread of COVID-19 would impact the production of apple products, however, the manufacturing facilities have resumed activity.8. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 142Headquartered in San Francisco, California, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a company that offers mobility as a service. The services offered by the company include ride-hailing, food, package delivery, couriers, etc. The company runs its operations in more than 63 countries and has over 110 million users. Almost 70% of the total revenue is generated through ride-sharing, while 20% comes from food delivery.The company’s Q3 revenue amounted to $8.34 billion, beating market expectations by $284.22 million. The company’s Normalized EPS stood at $0.21, missing market expectations by $0.27. The CEO, while commenting on results, stated that even with foreign exchange and inflationary headwinds impacting businesses globally, the company delivered better than expected in the quarter due to several factors, such as strong demand and better marketplace efficiency.As per Insider Monkey’s database, 142 hedge funds had stakes in Uber Technologies, Inc.

In July, we initiated our position in Uber, a leader in global ride-hailing and online food delivery. We believe the company is well positioned to benefit from strong secular tailwinds in both of its core businesses. Earlier this year, management outlined a plan at its investor day to achieve $4 billion of free cash flow by 2024, an encouraging commitment given investors have maligned the company for years of being unprofitable. We witnessed solid progress toward achieving this goal in the company’s most recent earnings results, where it beat expectations for the quarter on both fronts and delivered positive FCF for the first time. The company also indicated it isn’t seeing any evidence of slowing demand. We recognize the execution risk associated with Uber achieving its long-term targets, and the path likely won’t be linear, which is why we are keeping our position size modest until we see signs of continued operational momentum in the coming quarters.7.

In the pandemic recession of 2020, the aggregate earnings of the portfolios we manage did not decline year-over-year, and in fact grew, albeit modestly. Looking at the Great Recession which began at year-end 2007 and lasted to mid-year 2009 is helpful too. Our four largest current holdings in the portfolio weathered that period well. During this same period, Mastercard’s (NYSE:MA) earnings almost tripled.6. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 156Alphabet Inc.

But which of these two stocks offers value investors a better bang for their buck right now? We'll need to take a closer look.We have found that the best way to discover great value opportunities is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with a great grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The Zacks Rank favors stocks with strong earnings estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight companies with specific traits.Right now, Merit Medical is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Align Technology has a Zacks Rank of #5 (Strong Sell). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that MMSI likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ALGN has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value.MMSI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 27.41, while ALGN has a forward P/E of 28.21. We also note that MMSI has a PEG ratio of 2.49. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. ALGN currently has a PEG ratio of 22.93.Another notable valuation metric for MMSI is its P/B ratio of 3.68. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ALGN has a P/B of 4.20.These metrics, and several others, help MMSI earn a Value grade of B, while ALGN has been given a Value grade of D.Story continuesMMSI has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than ALGN, so it seems like value investors will conclude that MMSI is the superior option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

69,c8eb5ca9-4e1e-3eed-ab08-edc94b9c79db,MSFT,2022-12-21,Apple (AAPL) vs. Microsoft (MSFT): Which stock is the Better Buy for 2023?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/apple-aapl-vs-microsoft-msft-010601877.html,1671584761,STORY,"['AAPL', 'MSFT']","[Investing in technology stocks will take patience and higher risk tolerance at the moment but the sector’s broader 2022 decline may present great long-term buying opportunities.Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT, in particular, draw a lot of interest as historically dominant tech companies whose stocks could soar whenever inflationary and recessionary concerns are behind us and interest rates stop climbing.It will take some time for these risks to subside, but buying AAPL or MSFT stock as we head into 2023 is a worthy conversation.Recent Developments Despite beating earnings estimates in four consecutive quarters, Apple stock is now trading near its 52-week lows seen in June. Still, Apple stock has held up better than other big tech peers like Meta Platforms META and Amazon AMZN this year.With that being said, as we can see from the nearby chart AAPL’s fiscal fourth-quarter report in October has been a weak period of the year in terms of beating iPhone revenue expectations. This could be compounded by its current fiscal first quarter iPhone production being affected by shutdowns in Foxconn’s Shenzhen City, China Factory.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFoxconn is Apple’s largest iPhone maker and this has led to short-term weakness in the stock as it comes at a critical time during the holiday season. iPhone production is thought to have dropped 30% after Foxconn workers in Shenzhen fled the facility in late October due to Covid-19 outbreaks. Foxconn expects the facility to resume full production in late December or early January and is working to boost production at a nearby facility.  As for Microsoft, MSFT shares have bounced back nicely after reaching a low of $213.43 a share on November 4th as shown in the chart below. Like Apple, Microsoft stock has also held up better than the likes of Amazon and Meta Platforms. In regards to the latter, Microsoft has made its push into the metaverse as well. Microsoft’s planned acquisition of Activision Blizzard ATVI will help accelerate the growth of its gaming business and provide building blocks for the metaverse.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchHowever, an antitrust lawsuit was filed in early December by the Federal Trade Commission to block the Activision Blizzard acquisition, which was expected to be completed in June of 2023. Microsoft will of course fight the lawsuit.Performance &amp; Valuation Apple is now down -26% year to date Vs. Microsoft’s -28%. Both APPL and MSFT have outperformed the Nasdaq’s -32% YTD performance but lagged the S&amp;P 500’s -21%. Still, over the last decade, Microsoft and Apple’s total return including dividends has crushed the broader indexes, with MSFT having the edge at +970%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTrading around $242 per share and roughly 30% from its highs, MSFT has a forward P/E of 25.2X. In comparison, AAPL is 27% from its high and trades at $132 a share and 21.3X forward earnings.Both stocks are starting to trade attractively relative to their past. Microsoft’s stock trades 33% below its decade high of 37.4X and only 6% above its decade median of 23.7X. When comparing this period, AAPL is 44% off its decade-high of 38.6X but still 36% above its median of 15.6X. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGrowth &amp; Outlook Microsoft earnings are now projected to be up 3% in its current fiscal 2023 and climb another 14% in FY24 at $10.92 per share. It is important to note that earnings estimate revisions have trended down for both FY23 and FY24 over the last 90 days. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOn the top line, Microsoft’s sales are anticipated to rise 7% in FY23 and jump 13% in FY24 to $239.40 billion. FY24 would represent a 90% increase from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $125.84 billion. This is especially impressive for a mature company of Microsoft’s size.Pivoting to Apple, earnings are expected to rise 1% in its current fiscal 2023 and jump 8% in FY24 at $6.70 a share. Earnings estimates have also trended lower for Apple’s FY23 and FY24 over the last quarter. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSales are forecasted to be up 2% in FY23 and rise another 6% in FY24 at $427.22 billion. FY24 would represent 64% growth from pre-pandemic levels with 2019 sales at $260.17 billion.Dividends Microsoft’s stock appears to be sticking out to this point, and in regard to portfolio income, the trend continues with MSFT’s 1.13% annual dividend yield topping Apple’s 0.70%.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom Line Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) stock both currently land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Although more short-term weaknesses may be ahead for both companies they are starting to look attractive at their current levels. Microsoft especially stands out from a valuation standpoint. But with these being two unique tech firms and two of the biggest companies on the planet, holding on to or buying both stocks could be rewarding going into 2023.From a historical performance perspective, holding on to shares of Apple and Microsoft also makes sense after this year’s drop. There might be better buying opportunities ahead but both AAPL and MSFT have crushed the return of broader indexes over the last decade and this could continue considering their long-term growth is still intact.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to read about some more new tech stocks, go directly to 5 Best New Tech Stocks to Buy Now.Investments in the technology sector, traditionally seen as one of the most growth-oriented spaces in the market, have nosedived in recent months due to recession fears. Famous growth stocks like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB) have all seen their share prices decline by more than 20% this year so far. Investors wary of big tech but keen on recovery momentum should consider investing in new tech names that offer the same growth potential at much cheaper rates. New technology stocks can be safely seen as firms that demonstrate rates of growth that outpace the market average. Like growth stocks, these firms offer investors the chance to invest in firms whose revenue or net income is expected to grow faster than the market average. However, investments in new tech stocks can be more volatile as compared to established stocks. Investors should keep in mind that pouring money in new tech increases chances of earning profits from rapid price appreciation.  There are several new tech stocks that operate on different scales, such as highly promising small businesses to industry setups. Some of the key metrics that investors should look into for these firms include growing sales, revenues, and cash flows. These firms tend to have high valuations and their high prices, relative to profits, makes them more expensive. In 2022, there has been a mass exodus away from new tech towards value options in light of a macro slowdown that has pummeled the stock market. However, the third-quarter earnings show the anticipated economic slowdown might not be as bad as Wall Street expected. Recent data shows 26% fewer CEOs using the word recession in the third-quarter conference calls compared to the second quarter. Moreover, in the third quarter of 2022, 69% of S&amp;P 500 companies beat earnings estimates, while 71% beat the consensus revenue estimates. Since 2000, growth stocks have outperformed their value counterparts. However, this equation has changed in the past few months. Story continuesPhoto by Ruben Sukatendel on UnsplashInvestors interested in value offerings should also keep in mind that past performance does not predict future performance and picking individual stocks can also be a risky business. Many investors buy index mutual funds and exchange-traded funds, which bundle hundreds or thousands of stocks into a single investment. Even though these carry lower levels of risk, it is not very often that they outperform the broader market. New tech stocks, on the other hand, are a riskier but more rewarding bet. Our MethodologyThe companies that operate in the technology sector and debuted on the stock market in 2022 were selected for the list. Special importance was assigned to outlining the basic business fundamentals and analyst ratings for each firm to provide readers with some context so they can make more informed investment choices.

Yahoo Finance's Anjalee Khemlani joining us now with more. Just in terms of the restrictions, what does everyone need to know?ANJALEE KHEMLANI: Well, Seana, unfortunately, we've gotten to the point where we actually do have some restrictions from these major retailers, including CVS and Walgreens so far. Walmart and Amazon no word yet, as well as also Kroger, add to that list where there are limitations. So CVS, two pain relief medications per customer. This is only for pediatrics. Walgreens, six in total. Kroger has separated it between pain relief and cold and flu, which is also seeing a shortage, as we've reported on this show, for the past several weeks. And we know that shortage has also been sort of seeping over, if you will, into the adult category.I did reach out to the makers of children's Motrin and Tylenol-- that's Johnson &amp; Johnson-- as well as children's Advil because those are the three that are in shortage. Johnson &amp; Johnson got back to us, saying that, quote, ""we continue to experience high consumer demand driven by an extremely challenging cold and flu season."" But they noted that they're not experiencing the shortages that have been reported in the stores and have been increasing supply and producing 24/7.We know that the White House is aware of this. Recently, Dr. Ashish Jha interview saying that-- confirming that supply is up, but just the demand of flu RSV and COVID-19 circulating at the same time affecting this population, having that similar effect on demand.- And I know I personally firsthand have been having a tough time getting my hands on some of those medications. So, hopefully, supply is boosted very soon. Anjalee Khemlani, thanks so much.]"

The confluence of viral infections is pressuring pediatric health care facilities as well as suppliers of common cold and flu treatments, such as those that treat fever and pain.Walgreens told Yahoo Finance that as a result of the skyrocketing demand, it's limited online purchases.""Retailers nationwide are experiencing supplier fulfillment challenges due to increased demand of over-the-counter pediatric fever reducing products,"" the company said in a statement. ""While Walgreens continues to have products to support our customers and patients, we have put into effect an online only purchase limit of 6 per online transaction to prevent excess purchasing behavior,"" the company said in a statement.""For customers looking for items, our website updates with the latest available store inventory information frequently throughout the day,"" the company added.CVS has limited purchases to two pain relief medications per purchase both online and in stores.""We’re committed to meeting our customers’ needs and are working with our suppliers to ensure continued access to these items,"" the company said in a statement.A surge in flu and respiratory illnesses are creating medication shortages, including this South Florida pharmacy with no children's Tylenol in stock on Friday, Dec. 9, 2022.

Canadian pharmacies began limiting supplies last month and have increased imports as a result.In a recent interview, White House COVID-19 Response Coordinator Dr. Ashish Jha said that supply has increased, but ""the challenge is demand"" amid an unusual season of respiratory illnesses.Johnson &amp; Johnson, meanwhile, said in a statement that it was not ""experiencing widespread shortages of Children’s Tylenol or Children's Motrin."" It added that while it recognizes there may be shortages at some stores, ""we...are doing everything we can to make sure people have access to the products they need, including maximizing our production capacity, running our sites 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and continuously shipping out product.""Haleon declined to comment and redirected a Yahoo Finance media request to the Consumer Healthcare Products Association.CHPA issued a statement on Monday that reiterated manufacturers were running 24 hours a day to meet demand, and that there wasn't a widespread shortage.""However, with demand for children’s pain and fever medicines reaching unprecedented levels following this early and severe flu season (along with cases of RSV and COVID), we understand why some retailers have adjusted to impose limits on purchases...sales of pediatric internal analgesics are up 65% compared to the same time last year,"" the statement said.CHPA also noted that flu cases are on the decline, according to the latest national data.Follow Anjalee on Twitter @AnjKhemRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo FinanceDownload the Yahoo Finance app for Apple or AndroidFollow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and YouTube]"

US pharmacies are having a tough time keeping fever and pain medications in stock, as flu, respiratory syntactical virus, RSV, as it's known, and COVID-19 infections surge, particularly among children.CVS and Walgreens are both limiting purchases of pediatric cold and flu medicines as they face supply constraints and high demand, and consumers have been stockpiling medication. That's also contributing to the crunch. The shortage extends beyond over-the-counter drugs as well. The prescription antibiotic amoxicillin, often used to treat nose and throat infections in children, is also in short supply.A new report from an independent panel of experts says the Food and Drug Administration lacks a clear strategy in its fight against smoking. The report found that the work of the FDA'S Center for Tobacco Products has been made more difficult by the volume of product applications it receives and the amount of agency leadership turnover it has encountered. The review group calls on the Biden administration to establish an interagency task force to make enforcement of the tobacco laws a government wide priority.And Federal Communications Commission chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel distributed four forfeiture orders in August, penalizing cell phone carriers, AT&amp;T, Sprint, T-Mobile, and Verizon. That was for allegedly mishandling access to their customers' real-time locations. Those carriers could face roughly $200 million in fines.But the FCC can't issue the orders without approval from at least three commissioners. Two Democrats on the Commission have voted to approve the orders, but the Republican counterparts have yet to vote. And we should mention the FCC's leadership does have a vacant seat. The Senate has gone a full year without voting on the Biden nominee, Gigi Sohn.]"

The company's shares saw a decent share price growth in the teens level on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Starbucks’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Starbucks What's The Opportunity In Starbucks?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 9.85% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Starbucks today, you’d be paying a relatively fair price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $89.48, there’s only an insignificant downside when the price falls to its real value. What's more, Starbucks’s share price may be more stable over time (relative to the market), as indicated by its low beta.What does the future of Starbucks look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Starbucks' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 59%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? SBUX’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on SBUX, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

85,63b5ff37-756d-30d9-92dd-2cd189a288e4,ADM,2022-12-21,Ag Industry: 3 Top-Ranked Stocks to Grow your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ag-industry-3-top-ranked-191507954.html,1671563707,STORY,['ADM'],"[The stock market often moves in cycles, with different industry groups outperforming at different times. Cycles can occur due to various factors, including macroeconomic conditions, psychology, investor sentiment, and geopolitical factors.For instance, in periods of economic expansion, technology and consumer discretionary may outperform. In the recent post covid bull cycle, software, internet content, and growth-oriented stocks led the way. In a contractionary, slower growth cycle, utilities, consumer staples, and value stocks will achieve higher returns. In the current environment, two Zacks industry groups that have been handily outperforming are the Agriculture – Operations group (ranked 31 out of 248) and the Agriculture – Products group (ranked 61 out of 248).Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: The Ag- Operations Group has been an area of refuge for investors in 2022.While a strong industry group does not guarantee a stock’s success, it can increase the odds of success – and as investors, that’s all we can ask for. According to Zack’s studies, roughly half of a stock’s price movement can be attributed to the underlying industry group. The top 50% of Zacks Ranked Industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1. Below, we will cover three agriculture names with a highest possible Zacks Ranking of 1.1.   Cal-Maine CALM is the number one shell egg producer and distributor. The company produces a mind-blowing 6.8 million eggs per hour and has captured 19% of the shell egg market share. Over the past 12 months, Cal-Maine has drastically outperformed the market and its peers, surprised on earnings in three out of four quarters, and is attempting to break out of a multi-month consolidation area. (Pictured below)Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: CALM is breaking out ahead of its earnings release later this month. The stock has been a super performer this year.In the last reported quarter, CALM reported revenues that grew 103% year over year and swung to a profit from an EPS perspective. Zacks Consensus Estimates show a continued growth trajectory into 2023 as CALM gains traction in the space from top clients such as Costco Wholesale COST, Walmart WMT, and Kroger KR.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest continued momentum for CALM.Cal-Maine’s impressive client list and industry position has made a high-growth company and an efficient one. CALM boasts a return on equity of 25%. Despite the impressive growth trajectory, the stock can also be viewed as a potential value play. The stock holds a forward P/E of just 11.43, which compares favorably to the S&amp;P 500’s P/E of 16.99. Earnings are set to be released on December 28th.2.   Archer Daniels Midland ADM is one of the leading producers of oilseeds, corn, wheat, cocoa, and other food products and ingredients. Like Cal-Maine, Archer Daniels Midland holds the best possible Zacks Ranking of 1. In the most recent quarter, ADM saw EPS rise by 92% on revenue growth of 21%. What’s driving the growth? Low supply. Brazil’s poor growing season and the ongoing war in Ukraine have been a catalyst for ADM. Though both countries are seeing disruptions due to different reasons, both are major agricultural contributors to the global economy. ADM has been filling the void.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: ADM performance versus the S&amp;P 500.Though ADM has gone on a tremendous run over the past few years, the valuation is not unreasonable. ADM has a P/E ratio of 12.5, well below the S&amp;P 500.3.   Bunge Ltd BG produces grains, fertilizers, and oil seeds. Though the stock is a member of the strong agriculture group and is a top-ranked Zacks stock, it is not as attractive as ADM and CALM because:·      EPS last quarter was -7%, well below its counterparts.·      Relative weakness: While CALM and ADM trend above their 50-day moving averages and are near highs, BG is stuck in a choppy zone below its 200-day moving average.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPictured: Though BG is highly ranked, shares have lagged its peers.Conclusion: Because of their earnings growth, reasonable valuation, and strong forward expectations, Cal-Maine Foods and Archer Daniels Midland are the two leaders in the ag group. While Bunge also has strong expectations, it does not compare favorably to its industry group peers.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Persistent growth in the Nutrition segment bodes well. Gains from the integrated global value chain and a solid product portfolio have been bolstering the company’s performance.These tailwinds have aided the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock to return 43.6% over the course of the past year, comfortably outpacing the industry’s 22% growth. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Let’s Delve DeeperArcher Daniels remains on track with the Readiness goals of driving business improvement, standardizing functions and enriching consumers’ experience. As part of readiness efforts, the company introduced a company-wide simplification initiative. The company’s strategic pillars for growth are guided and supported by the Readiness program, which focused on accelerating and enhancing competitiveness.In addition, Archer Daniels’ strategic transformation mainly focuses on two strategic pillars, namely Productivity and Innovation. The Productivity pillar comprises boosting the roles of the company’s centers of excellence in procurement, supply-chain and functions to deliver more efficiencies; roll out of the 1ADM business transformation program and implementation of enhanced standardized business processes; and greater use of technology, analytics, and automation at production facilities.The Innovation pillar includes expansions in enriching the customer experience with leveraging producer relationships and improving the use of state-of-the-art digital technology. This also covers sustainability-driven innovation, spreading across the complete range of products, solutions, capabilities, and commitments to cater to customers efficiently.Growth efforts, including organic growth to drive additional capacity, are resonating well with burgeoning demand. The company is also indulging in strategic mergers and buyouts.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWe note that management is looking to expand its footprint in the fast-growing alternative protein area. Notably, Archer Daniels inked an agreement with Benson Hill to process and commercialize a portfolio of proprietary ingredients derived from their ultra-high protein soybeans.The company has also been making efforts to expand its solutions portfolio, which forms part of its Carbohydrate Solutions unit. Markedly, the company collaborated with LG Chem for two joint ventures. This will help produce lactic acid and polylactic acid for a variety of applications, including bioplastics across the United States.Archer Daniels continues to adapt to consumers changing nutritional preferences. Robust gains from its Nutrition unit have been bolstering ADM’s overall results. During third-quarter 2022, revenues in the segment rose 9.8% year over year.The segment’s adjusted operating profit grew 0.6% year over year, owing to significant gains in the Human and Animal Nutrition units. The Human Nutrition unit gained from solid demand for plant-based proteins and strength in Specialty Ingredients. Flavors unit gained from robust demand growth in EMEA.Management expects the segment to witness year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2022, driven by continued demand in human nutrition, which is likely to more than offset currency headwinds. Also, the nutrition segment is predicted to grow 15-20% in operating profit on a constant currency basis in 2022.Bottom LineWe hope that strength in its nutrition unit, product innovation and solid demand will help sustain the stock’s momentum on the bourses. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 sales and earnings per share is pegged at $102.2 billion and $7.46, respectively. These estimates show year-over-year growth of 19.9% and 43.7%, respectively. Topping it, a long-term earnings growth rate of 7.2% and a VGM Score of B drive optimism.Other Stocks to ConsiderSome other top-ranked stocks are Chef's Warehouse CHEF, General Mills GIS and MGP Ingredients MGPI.Chef’s Warehouse, a distributor of specialty food products in the United States, currently sports a Zacks Rank of 1. CHEF has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 93.8%, on average.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Chef Warehouse’s current financial year’s sales suggests growth of 46.5% from the year-ago reported numbers.General Mills, which manufactures and markets branded consumer foods worldwide, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). GIS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 6.1%, on average.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Mills’ current financial year’s sales and earnings per share suggests growth of 2.8% and 4.1%, respectively, from the year-ago reported figures.MGP Ingredients, which produces and markets ingredients and distillery products, currently sports a Zacks Rank of 2.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. ADM, H&amp;E Equipment Services Inc. HEES, Veritiv Corp. VRTV, U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. SLCA and Barrett Business Services Inc. BBSI.Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:Shrug Off Market Gyrations with These Top 5 Value StocksWall Street is just nine trading days away from closing a highly disappointing 2022. Even for these last few days, market participants are not sure in which direction the U.S. stock markets will move. Investors are skeptical of a year-end rally — popularly known as Santa Claus Rally — for this year.These negative sentiments arise as recession fears grip markets resulting from the fact that the Fed has so far failed to cool inflation to an acceptable level despite hiking the benchmark interest rate by 4.25% in 2022 along with other monetary tightening measures like termination of the $120 billion per month quantitative easing program and gradual shrinking of the $9 trillion balance sheet.At this stage, it would be prudent to pick value stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank to cushion the portfolio as well as make some gains from the upside potential. These stocks could prove to be valuable once the rally resumes. Five of them are Archer-Daniels-Midland Co., H&amp;E Equipment Services Inc., Veritiv Corp., U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. and Barrett Business Services Inc..Recession Fears Grip MarketsU.S. stocks continued to suffer in the last two weeks after the Fed announced a 50-basis point rate hike, with losses deepening. Stocks took a further hit as disappointing retail sales for November sparked fears of a slowing economy.On Dec 14, the Fed increased interest rates by another 50 basis points. Fed Chair Jerome Powell had earlier hinted that the central bank could slow down its pace of rate hikes after increasing interest rates by 75 basis points for the fourth consecutive time since June.Story continuesThe Fed did slow down the pace but Powell did not paint a rosy picture for the future. In fact, Powell indicated that the central bank would continue increasing interest rates at regular intervals through 2023.Wednesday's hike took the benchmark range of 4.25% to 4.50%, and the Fed projected it to top out at 5.25% before it takes a call on pausing the hikes. This is higher than the September forecast of 4.75%.    Recession fears were further ignited after central banks in Europe also hinted at hiking interest rates through 2023. Both the Bank of England and the European Central Bank slowed down their pace of rate hikes but increased interest rates by 50 basis points. Investors were once again alarmed by this as they believe that the ongoing rate increases could push the UK and Eurozone into a recession, setting the tone for a panic sell-off.Our Top PicksAt this juncture, investors should be prepared to minimize fluctuations in their portfolio and consequently rebalance it with suitable financial assets to maintain stability. We have narrowed our search to five value stocks. Each of our picks carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value Score of A. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Archer-Daniels-Midland has been gaining from solid demand, improved productivity and product innovations.

Air-travel demand made a stronger-than-expected recovery as people are again booking flights, thereby boosting passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of most airlines' top lines. Airline players like Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are likely to benefit from robust demand for air travel.However, high fuel costs are limiting bottom-line growth. Moreover, the labor crunch that is currently being faced by the airline industry is another woe.About the IndustryThe Zacks Airline industry includes players engaged in transporting passengers and cargo to various destinations globally. Most operators maintain a fleet of multiple mainline jets in addition to several regional planes. Operations are aided by their regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers.Additionally, industry players utilize their respective cargo divisions to offer a wide range of freight and mail services. The players invest substantially to upgrade technology. The industry, apart from comprising legacy carriers, includes low-cost players. The well-being of companies in this group is linked to the health of the overall economy. For example, the aviation space was one of the worst pandemic-hit corners, with passenger revenues taking a severe beating. However, air-travel demand is rosy now.The focus on boosting cargo revenues is an added positive.Key Themes Governing the Airline IndustryIATA's Bullish Forecast: Following the removal of coronavirus-induced restrictions, pent-up demand is driving traffic for the airlines. Despite inflationary pressures and supply-chain woes, there is a wave of optimism surrounding air-travel demand. The buoyant scenario with respect to air-travel demand is expected to improve further in 2023. As a result, airlines are expected to return to profitability next year. Per the International Air Transport Association (IATA), net profits for airlines across the globe are likely to be $4.7 billion in 2023. The top line next year is anticipated to be $779 billion compared with the current-year estimate of $727 billion.Story continuesWith people again taking to the skies, the greatest driver of top-line improvement is passenger revenues. Per IATA, passenger revenues for the next year are anticipated to be $522 billion (85.5% of 2019 [pre-coronavirus] levels). The 2023 projection is higher than the current-year estimate of $438 billion, despite economic uncertainties.Bottom Line Suffers Due to Oil Price Increase: Even though oil price declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains high. Notably, oil prices increased 5.7% in the first nine months of 2022, induced by the Russia-Ukraine war. Per IATA's December forecast, the current-year fuel bill for the industry is projected at $222 billion, higher than the forecast of $192 billion made in June.Focus on Cargo Revenues: An Added Positive: The focus of airlines on boosting cargo revenues bodes well for top-line growth, especially in the current scenario where passenger revenues are rebounding strongly from the pandemic lows. Per IATA's forecast, cargo revenues are expected to be $201.4 billion. That is an improvement in 2022, which is way above the 2019 actual of $100.8 billion. Cargo revenues in 2023 are expected to be $149.4 billion, which is lower than the current-year projection but still $48.6 billion higher than the 2019 actuals.Staffing Crunch a Bane: The airline industry in the United States is being plagued by tensions on the labor front. With airlines trimming their labor force substantially during the peak of the pandemic, the industry is grappling with a staff crunch as demand bounces back. Due to labor scarcity, many U.S. airlines trimmed their capacity, which in turn, is likely to drain profitability. Reduced capacity is pushing up non-fuel unit costs. IATA expects total costs in 2023 to increase 5.3% to 5.3% to $776 billion. The increase is likely to be mainly due to labor, skill and capacity shortages.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Sunny ProspectsThe Zacks Airline industry is a 29-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #84, which places it in the top 34% of 250 plus Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to retain in your portfolio, let's look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Underperforms Sector but Outperforms S&amp;P 500 The Zacks Transportation - Airline industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite while underperforming broader Transportation sector over the past year.The industry has declined 15.4% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's depreciation of 17.2% and the broader sector's decrease of 12.6%.The Valuation PictureThe Price/Sales (P/S) ratio is often used to value airline stocks. The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/S of 0.37X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 3.31X. It is also below the sector's forward-12-month P/S of 1.56X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.01X, as low as 0.32X and at the median of 0.68X.3 Transportation - Airline Stocks to Keep Tabs OnUnited Airlines has a market capitalization of $12.56 billion, presently. On the back of upbeat air-travel demand, UAL was profitable in the third quarter of 2022. The third quarter was the second consecutive profitable quarter at UAL since the onset of the pandemic. Management stated that air-travel demand and pricing are still strong. These factors should boost fourth-quarter results.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings has moved 7.6% north at UAL. United Airlines carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy), currently.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereThe gradual improvement in air-travel demand in the United States is a huge boon for Southwest Airlines, based in Dallas, and currently having a market cap of $22.14 billion.Driven by the continued strength witnessed with respect to passenger yield, LUV expects fourth-quarter 2022 operating revenues to increase in the 13-17% band from the fourth-quarter 2019 actuals. Fleet-modernization efforts of LUV are encouraging as well.Following the lifting of restrictions under the CARES Act, which prohibited airlines from paying dividends till Sep 30, 2022, Southwest Airlines' management reinstated its quarterly dividend of 18 cents per share. With the carrier returning to profitability in March 2022 and expecting to be profitable for full-year 2022 as well, the decision was hugely expected. The dividend will be paid on Jan 31, 2023 to its shareholders of record at the close of business on Jan 10.Southwest Airlines' earnings outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. The average beat is 54.7%. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has moved 3.1% north at LUV. Currently, LUV carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Delta has a market capitalization of $21.23 billion, presently. DAL, based in Atlanta, GA, is being bolstered by the uptick in demand for air travel (particularly for leisure). Driven by upbeat air-travel demand, Delta expects fourth-quarter 2022 operating margin to be 11%, i.e. at the top of the previously guided 9-11% range.DAL now expects adjusted earnings per share in the $1.35-$1.40 range (the earlier outlook was in the range of $1-$1.25). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.20. Total revenues are now likely to increase in the 7-8% range from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals (the earlier outlook was for an increase in the 5-9% range).Delta's earnings outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters (missing the mark in the remaining ones). The average beat is 7.9%. DAL carries a Zacks Rank #3, currently.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

Yet many still want the power to choose between online and retail (in-person) experiences - depending on their convenience and needs. Exclusive insights show that today almost 60% of consumers who send money abroad prefer digital money-transfer services, compared to 22% who want choice, and 17% who send cash through retail channels only.The study, which surveyed over 1,500 money-sending and receiving citizens and residents of Saudi Arabia, asked how, when and why they move money internationally. The results bolster Western Union’s recently announced ‘Evolve 2025’ (E25) strategy combining high-value, accessible digital and retail financial services. The research also aligns to Western Union data, which has demonstrated strong customer preferences to move money digitally. In the first three quarters of 2022, the Company experienced double-digit year-on-year growth in the volume of digital transactions from Saudi Arabia.When asked about how international money transfers should be offered in the future, consumer opinion among senders is mixed. More (47%) still believe that the transfer experience should be digital from end-to-end, while 44% prefer choice and 9% would still opt for cash only. In reverse, 57% of consumers who receive transfers prefer a choice, while 24% favour going completely digital. Nineteen percent would still want to collect their funds in cash only.Story continues""Since launching their ambitious National Transformation Program – Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia has made significant strides in achieving digital transformation,"" said Jean Claude Farah, President of Middle East and Asia Pacific at Western Union. ""The country’s visionary leaders have been steadfast in developing the necessary infrastructure to support this evolution. As a result, today it ranks seventh for its digital competitiveness among the G20, while internet penetration across the country sits at an impressive 98%. The study outcomes demonstrate that citizens and residents have been very much part of this journey – largely opting for online options over in-person experiences, as they benefit from the country’s increasingly advanced digital framework.""Receivers hold strong influence over frequency and flow of moneyThe research also shows that receivers of funds strongly influence how much and how often their senders transfer money. Overall, 34% of senders say their families or loved ones’ financial situation drives decisions on the frequency and flow of money. Sixty eight percent also say their receiver influences the company they choose to send money through, and 74% state their transfer method of choice (digital, retail or a mix) is dependent on how their receiver can collect the money.Looking at the broader macro-economic climate, a significant number of consumers expect to send (74%) or receive (66%) more money in the next 12 months. However, senders also struggle with a cost-of-living dichotomy: 73% of senders say that because cost-of-living has increased in their receiving country, they now need to send more money; yet 67% state that higher cost-of-living in their current country of residence, means they are not able to transfer as much as they did previously.""Providing a crucial link between senders and receivers helps consumers build a bridge to financial stability and opportunity,"" Farah said. ""As we adapt to higher costs-of-living, supporting consumers as they move up the economic ladder becomes even more important. The public and private sectors have a collective role to play here. If we collaborate effectively, we will be able to offer even stronger financial opportunities and experiences that will ultimately help them better manage their financial lives.""Women prioritize why they send cross-border money transfers differently to menThe study also shows that a greater number of women in Saudi Arabia send money transfers more often than once a month, compared to men. Nearly a quarter of the women surveyed (vs. 21% of men) say they move money multiple times within a month.Paying for family support is the primary reason why men move money (55%). While this is of utmost importance to many women as well (42%), women also place stronger emphasis on reasons such as paying for financial commitments, future savings and education payments.""Globally, women comprise slightly less than half of today’s expatriate workers,"" Farah concluded. ""They are more empowered than ever before, as they move internationally and shape global economies. In line with Vision 2030, Saudi Arabia is focused on attracting the finest local and international minds to bolster economic development. Their ambition to increase women’s participation in the workforce to 30% by 2030 means that ensuring greater access to financial services is imperative, particularly with the rise of new technologies.""About Western UnionThe Western Union Company (NYSE: WU) is a global leader in cross-border, cross-currency money movement and payments.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. BlackRock (BLK) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $7.89 a share, just 24 days from its upcoming earnings release on January 13, 2023.BlackRock's Earnings ESP sits at 0.64%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $7.89 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.84.BLK is part of a big group of Finance stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at Simon Property (SPG) as well.Slated to report earnings on February 6, 2023, Simon Property holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $3.15 a share 48 days from its next quarterly update.Story continuesFor Simon Property, the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.14 is 0.42%.BLK and SPG's positive ESP metrics may signal that a positive earnings surprise for both stocks is on the horizon.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

The partnership seems a strategic fit for SPG as it anticipates its stake in Jamestown to be accretive to earnings.Jamestown is known to have a 39-year track record and had more than $13 billion of assets under management as of Jun 30, 2022. Through the partnership, Simon Property will be able to drive its future densification projects with the help of Jamestown’s platform.Also, with an experienced fund manager and mixed-use operator and developer, SPG will have the scope to capitalize on the growing asset and investment management businesses.Simon Property has been focusing on premium acquisitions and transformative redevelopments to enhance its portfolio and has invested billions in transforming its properties over the past few years.In June 2022, SPG acquired an additional interest in Gloucester Premium Outlets from a joint venture partner for $14 million in cash consideration, including a pro-rata share of working capital, resulting in the consolidation of this property.Additionally, Simon Property has been exploring the mixed-use development option, which has gained immense popularity in recent years as it helps capture the attention of people who prefer to live, work and play in the same area.Furthermore, it capitalized on purchasing recognized retail brands in bankruptcy. Investments in them seem strategic for Simon Property as the brands have been generating a decent amount from digital sales.With a solid balance-sheet position and ample financial flexibility, SPG is well-positioned to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 28.8% in the quarter-to-date period compared with its industry’s growth of 15.4%.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchStocks to ConsiderSome better-ranked stocks from the retail REIT sector are STORE Capital STOR, Kite Realty Group Trust KRG and Tanger Factory Outlet Centers SKT, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

(NYSE:HCA) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.10bUS$5.56bUS$6.41bUS$7.02bUS$7.47bUS$7.85bUS$8.18bUS$8.46bUS$8.72bUS$8.96bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x5Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 6.43%Est @ 5.10%Est @ 4.16%Est @ 3.51%Est @ 3.05%Est @ 2.73% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.4% US$4.7kUS$4.8kUS$5.2kUS$5.3kUS$5.2kUS$5.1kUS$4.9kUS$4.8kUS$4.6kUS$4.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$49bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.4%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$9.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.4%– 2.0%) = US$167bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$167b÷ ( 1 + 7.4%)10= US$82bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$131b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$239, the company appears quite undervalued at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at HCA Healthcare as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.4%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.980. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for HCA HealthcareStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Healthcare market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatTotal liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value? For HCA Healthcare, we've compiled three further factors you should further examine:Risks: We feel that you should assess the 3 warning signs for HCA Healthcare (1 is a bit concerning!) we've flagged before making an investment in the company.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for HCA's future outlook?

If you want to see more undervalued wide moat stocks to invest in, go directly to 5 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Invest in.Wide moat stocks are stocks with substantial competitive advantages that keep competitors from affecting their business that much.Examples of wide moat stocks would be a company with a monopoly that's very difficult for any competitor to gain market share from.Another example of a wide moat stock would be a company with substantial network effects and scale.Given competitors have a difficult time gaining market share, wide moat stocks tend to be profitable. In terms of their industry, they tend to have higher margins than their competitors given their leading position.With their earnings, wide moat companies use the profits generated to either pay dividends, buy back shares, or to invest the capital back into their existing businesses or new ventures.As a result of their steady businesses, some of the leading wide moat businesses have increased their annual dividends for 25 years or more.Undervalued StocksUndervalued stocks are stocks of companies that are trading below their intrinsic value.A company's intrinsic value is basically what the company is really worth and not the market capitation the market is currently assigning it.In bull markets, quality undervalued companies can be rare because valuations are often fairly high through the market given market optimism.In bear markets, however, quality undervalued companies can be more common than during bull markets because lower valuations are more common.2022The market has decreased given the Federal Reserve has raised interest rates seven times this year to fight inflation. Although October and November's inflation results were better than expected, the U.S. central bank has signaled it will raise interest rates even further next year as well.As of December 19, the S&amp;P 500 is down 20.41% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has retreated 10.46% year to date and the Nasdaq Composite has declined 33.39% year to date.Story continuesGiven the substantial increase in interest rates, many economists think there will likely be a recession next year as a result. If the recession is moderate to severe, many companies might not meet earnings estimates and the broader market could decline further.If the broader market declines, the leading undervalued wide moat stocks could retreat further in the near term. In the long term, however, the leading stocks could have considerable upside.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Amazonchristian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 11 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Invest in, we selected 11 stocks with wide moats and substantial competitive advantages that arguably trade below their intrinsic value.We then ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of Q3.For those of you interested, also check out 12 Best Undervalued Stocks To Buy Now.11 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Invest in11. State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) is a leading asset manager that is a pioneer in ETF and index investing whose shares current trade for a forward P/E ratio of 9.4. Given the company's competitive advantages such as its strong brand and scale that give it a wide moat, State Street Corporation (NYSE:STT) is arguably undervalued. Analysts estimate the company will earn $7.19 per share in 2022, $8.16 per share in 2023, and $9.16 per share in 2024.Alongside Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc.

BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) is the largest asset manager in the world with assets under management of around $10 trillion. Given the company's AUM, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) has a wide moat considering its scale that allows it to realize higher margins than many of its competitors.Although the stock trades for a forward P/E ratio of 20.25, the leading asset manager has substantial AUM growth potential with the expected growth in ETFs in the future. If it maintains its market share in ETFs, the company's earnings per share also has substantial growth potential.Of the 920 hedge funds in our database, 46 owned shares of BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) at the end of Q3, ranking the stock #10 on our list of 11 Undervalued Wide Moat Stocks to Invest in.9. Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 69Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is Wall Street's leading bank with the best brand name and many of the financial sector's best employees. Given the intellectual capital and the bank's already immense resources, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) is a leader in investment banking and trading that can generate substantial normalized profits in the long term.Given that shares have declined 9.92% year to date, Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) currently trades for a forward P/E ratio of 9.22 which is pretty attractive in the long term given the bank's competitive advantages.8. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 77As one of the big four banks in the United States, Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) has substantial scale that affords the company wider margins than many of its smaller competitors. Given the higher interest rates, the bank has an opportunity to earn more in terms of net interest margin. Wells Fargo &amp; Company (NYSE:WFC) is also increasing its capital returns.

Despite the positives of higher interest rates and the company making good progress on reducing expenses and regulatory consent orders, Wells Fargo shares have fallen one-third from their highs earlier this year to roughly 6.5x our estimate of normalized earnings power, and the stock ended the quarter at ~1x next year’s tangible book value. We find this is far too cheap for a strong banking franchise capable of tangible returns in the low-to-mid teens across business cycles.7. Citigroup Inc.

Although the bank faces near term headwinds, Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) could potentially increase its earnings in the long term and its stock might trade closer to its book value as a result.Citigroup Inc.

When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Schlumberger Schlumberger Insider Transactions Over The Last YearOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive Vice President of Geographies, Khaled Al Mogharbel, for US$3.2m worth of shares, at about US$54.85 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$51.76. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).In the last year Schlumberger insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insiders At Schlumberger Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Schlumberger shares. In total, insiders sold US$6.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes Schlumberger Boast High Insider Ownership?For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Schlumberger insiders own about US$134m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Schlumberger Tell Us?Insiders sold Schlumberger shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But it is good to see that Schlumberger is growing earnings. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Schlumberger. For example - Schlumberger has 2 warning signs we think you should be aware of.But note: Schlumberger may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So, when we ran our eye over Packaging Corporation of America's (NYSE:PKG) trend of ROCE, we really liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Packaging Corporation of America, this is the formula:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.21 = US$1.6b ÷ (US$8.3b - US$963m) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Packaging Corporation of America has an ROCE of 21%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 11% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Packaging Corporation of America roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Packaging Corporation of America compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Packaging Corporation of America.How Are Returns Trending?We'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Packaging Corporation of America. The company has consistently earned 21% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 42% in that time. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If Packaging Corporation of America can keep this up, we'd be very optimistic about its future.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On Packaging Corporation of America's ROCEIn the end, the company has proven it can reinvest it's capital at high rates of returns, which you'll remember is a trait of a multi-bagger. However, over the last five years, the stock has only delivered a 25% return to shareholders who held over that period. So because of the trends we're seeing, we'd recommend looking further into this stock to see if it has the makings of a multi-bagger.One final note, you should learn about the   2 warning signs  we've spotted with Packaging Corporation of America (including 1 which is potentially serious) .If you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this free list of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.1% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.28%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.09%.Prior to today's trading, shares of the medical device maker had lost 0.34% over the past month. This has lagged the Medical sector's gain of 1.23% and was narrower than the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.6% in that time.Investors will be hoping for strength from Hologic as it approaches its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $0.87, down 59.91% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $962.24 million, down 34.59% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $3.46 per share and revenue of $3.81 billion. These totals would mark changes of -42.52% and -21.56%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Hologic. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Hologic currently has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).Investors should also note Hologic's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 21.16. Its industry sports an average Forward P/E of 29.81, so we one might conclude that Hologic is trading at a discount comparatively.Story continuesMeanwhile, HOLX's PEG ratio is currently 1.39.

There's a new study out saying that the streaming giant's 6.99 ad plan accounted for just 9% of signups last month. Yahoo Finance's Alexandra Canal has more on this story. Allie, going into this launch, there was certainly a lot of hype. Maybe this is what Netflix needed to do in order to attract new users. Doesn't look like that's happening, or at least, just yet.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, not smooth sailing--DAVE BRIGGS: No.ALEXANDRA CANAL: --at least from the start, according to these various reports. And that data was from Antenna. It's a streaming analytics firm cited by the Wall Street Journal. And it noted that the ad tier accounted for just 9% of signups for the month, with 43% trading down to that cheaper plan. Now to compare this to a competitor, we saw HBO Max have stronger results when it launched its own ad supported offering in June 2021. At that time, 15% of new signups were seen in the US during that first month, with just 14% of users trading down.So if you compare apples to apples there, the Netflix tier is struggling a bit. I did reach out to Netflix for a comment. They said, quote, ""there are a number of inaccuracies in this reporting. It's still very early days for our ad-supported tier, and we're pleased with its launch and engagement, as well as the eagerness of advertisers to partner with Netflix.""But let's talk about that for a second because last week, we saw a report from Digiday, which said the streaming giant fell short on viewership guarantees it made to advertisers for the ad tier and was then allowing ad buyers to take their money back. At the heels of that report, the stock plummeted 9%, the largest intraday drop since April. So this is something that investors are heavily watching.Story continuesWe spoke with Tim Nollen on the show from Macquarie yesterday. He said that by and large, it's still early days. This is going to take time. He anticipated incremental revenue will not happen until 2024 or 2025. But if they do fail on this, that's going to be reflected in the stock price because this was a huge part of Netflix's growth and recovery story.DAVE BRIGGS: I don't see it advertised a lot. I'm curious about that. And maybe people don't know yet-- still the early innings. All right, we want to stay with some media news. A bold prediction from Wells Fargo on the future of ESPN. What is Steven Cahill saying, and why does it matter so much?ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yes, his 2023 media predictions, and he said this has been a tough year for media. And 2023 will lead to some very tough decisions. And specific to Disney, he said that he anticipates ESPN will spin off, which is a very bold call, very polarizing topic amongst analysts. He wrote, quote, ""Disney will begin the spinoff process for ESPN and ABC, including launching ESPN and streaming a la carte. Cost rationalization and balance sheet options are critical to reaching this outcome. The result is a better off remaining Disney.""Now, Disney has struggled in terms of profitability, particularly with that direct-to-consumer streaming, which includes ESPN+, Hulu, and Disney+. It did lose $4 billion for 2022. However, ESPN has funded a lot of those endeavors. So that's sort of the flip side of the equation. Some analysts have said, look, how can you get rid of ESPN? This is a really valuable asset to Disney.But then others have come out and said they could get a pretty big paycheck if they were to spin this off.DAVE BRIGGS: From who? There seems so few. Apple, Amazon-- beyond them, it's not entirely clear. Cahill very well respected, very plugged in, but most think ESPN is the stickiest thing Disney has for these bundles. All right, Allie, stick around. I want to talk to you about this. As evidenced by the record 16.8 million people that watched the World Cup Final Sunday on Fox, sports viewership has never been bigger.But could trouble be right around the corner? Perhaps, according to a new study from Morning Consult, which shows that Gen Z watches dramatically less live sports than older generations. In fact, 47% of US adults watch on broadcast or live TV. Just 28% of Gen Z and a full third of Gen Zers don't watch sports at all. So while these sports media rights are massive and continue to expand, there is some trouble around the corner, which really leans into streaming.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Yeah, and these industry executives, especially in this space, they want to cater to Gen Z. How do they attract that Gen Z fan base? Also in this study, nearly half of Gen Zers said they have never watched a professional sporting event live, which is crazy to me.DAVE BRIGGS: Wow.ALEXANDRA CANAL: But if you think about it, they are growing up in this generation of cord cutters, right? So that barrier to entry is a little tougher than it was when I was growing up. Even for me, I subscribe to YouTube TV. But if I want to watch my Eagles on a Sunday at 1:00 PM, I can if the Giants or the Jets are on. So already, there's that issue there. So if they're flocking to those sites like TikTok, YouTube, Snapchat, where you can't watch a live sporting event, maybe that's what's attributing to their lack of interest in it.SEANA SMITH: Yeah, and I think, just purely, the number of options that they have right now out there, like, I think when a lot of us were growing up, you were more accustomed to maybe watching some of these games. You would sit down with your family. Now there is just a plethora of options out there, just in terms of sitcoms. Anything you want to watch is at your fingertips. So this whole streaming era is very different.And I also just think that Gen Z doesn't have maybe the focus to sit there and watch through hours and hours of games. You talk about it all the time. Your son likes to watch RedZone when it comes to NFL. So he's watching--DAVE BRIGGS: Bits and pieces, yeah.SEANA SMITH: So he's watching the live footage, which a lot of Gen Z isn't doing. But I think people more want to know what the outcome is, rather than sit down and enjoy the game, which I just don't really understand.DAVE BRIGGS: I have a 16-year-old who didn't watch a single live sporting event until the World Cup this year. They don't have a whole lot of loyalty to teams either. And that's not a knock. They just grew up in a different world where teams don't matter to them. They like content. They consume content, but they won't sit, to your point, and watch two, three, four hours of one team because they don't have that loyalty. Big implications.ALEXANDRA CANAL: I blame the parents for this because I have two young cousins that are very hardcore. And if you have a parent-- or so, what about you?DAVE BRIGGS: I blame the phone.ALEXANDRA CANAL: You blame the phone, OK.DAVE BRIGGS: Social media.ALEXANDRA CANAL: You're a dad, so I understand.SEANA SMITH: It's hard to keep their attention.DAVE BRIGGS: Social media, it is the TikTok generation. Allie, excellent reporting today. Thank you.]"

About 57% of those ad-supported subscribers re-joined the service or signed up for the first time. 43% traded down to the cheaper plan, Antenna data revealed.""If this doesn't work, I think the stock will suffer because part of the recovery story for Netflix stock is getting this advertising tier to work,"" Tim Nollen, analyst at Macquarie Group, told Yahoo Finance Live on Monday.To compare, Warner Bros. Discovery's (WBD) HBO Max saw stronger results after its $9.99 ad-supported tier debuted in June 2021. At that time, the plan accounted for 15% of new signups in the U.S. during its first month, while just 14% of the new users downgraded from the more expensive, ad-free tier.In a statement, a Netflix spokesperson told Yahoo Finance, ""There are a number of inaccuracies in this reporting. It’s still very early days for our ad supported tier and we’re pleased with its launch and engagement, as well as the eagerness of advertisers to partner with Netflix.""Netflix shares were little-changed on Tuesday afternoon.Antenna's study comes after Netflix's stock lost nearly 9% last Thursday, its biggest intraday drop since April, after a new report from Digiday said the streaming giant fell short on viewership guarantees it made to advertisers for the ad tier.According to Digiday, which cited five agency executives, Netflix is now allowing ad buyers to take their money back after missing viewership targets. The company reportedly only delivered around 80% of the expected audience.Story continues""Netflix is in a bit of a quandary here in getting the service off the ground,"" Macquarie's Nollen admitted. ""They are diluting themselves by trying to convert their U.S. subscriber base to an ad-supported plan. It's $3 less per month. That's $3 less per subscriber right there. They have to make up for that with ad sales.""Nollen argued it will take time for the company's ad tier to fully mature, surmising the company won't see incremental revenue from the new offering until at least 2024 or 2025.""It's not a completely transformational game-changer for Netflix, but it should be revenue-enhancing,"" he added.Shares of Netflix, down about 50% since the start of the year, have climbed roughly 65% over the past six months as other industry watchers see content improvements decreasing churn in 2023.""Wednesday"" (Courtesy: Netflix)Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The figure also came short of Disney’s expectation of $135-$150 million.Internationally, Avatar: The Way of Water grossed $300.5 million, bringing the movie’s opening overall weekend collection to $434.5 million, trailing Marvel Studios’ Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness ($442 million).Per CNBC data, China accounted for $57.1 million in ticket sales for the three-day opening weekend. China contributed roughly $265 million to the original Avatar movie, which, despite collecting only $77 million in the opening weekend, went on to become the highest-grossing movie of all time.The first Avatar movie, released in 2009, grossed $2.9 billion worldwide. It edged out Avengers: Endgame after a September 2022 re-release helped the movie add $73 million in ticket sales.Disney shares fell 4.77% to $85.78 at close on Dec 19.

This has aided subscriber growth as Disney+ added more than 12 million global subscribers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022.However, Disney’s direct-to-consumer division reported an operating loss of $1.5 billion in fourth-quarter fiscal 2022, which doubled year over year. This has been attributed to macroeconomic factors like inflation, which have spiked up the cost of production for the company, as well as adverse foreign exchange impact that decreased Disney+’s ARPU by 5%.Disney+ also faces significant competition from Netflix NFLX, which has a strong pipeline of content and has reached 223 million subscribers worldwide. A saturated streaming market, with the presence of services from the likes of Apple AAPL and Comcast CMCSA, is creating headwinds for Disney+.Streaming market leader, Netflix, reported better-than-expected third-quarter 2022 subscriber numbers. The streaming giant gained 2.41 million paid subscribers globally, higher than its estimate of gaining one million users. Netflix added 4.38 million paid subscribers in the year-ago quarter.Apple’s streaming service, Apple TV+, continues to gain recognition with its critically acclaimed and popular shows like Ted Lasso.Comcast’s Peacock had more than 15 million paid subscribers in the United States at the end of third-quarter 2022. Moreover, Peacock had approximately 14 million bundled and free users, totaling around 30 million monthly active accounts.Nevertheless, Disney is focusing on the realignment of cost, including meaningful rationalization of marketing spending, and optimization of content slate and distribution approach to deliver a steady state of high-impact releases that efficiently drive engagement.Disney also reappointed Robert A. Iger, popularly known as Bob Iger, as CEO. Bob Iger had actively been involved in the launch of Disney+ in 2019. His expertise and experience of more than four decades are likely to help the company create an efficient and cost-effective structure for the streaming platform.This Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) company expects Disney+ to reach profitability by 2024.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use tried-and-true metrics and fundamental analysis to find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.Par Pacific (PARR) is a stock many investors are watching right now. PARR is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 4.66 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 5.29. Over the past year, PARR's Forward P/E has been as high as 44.68 and as low as -12.73, with a median of 11.82.Value investors also frequently use the P/S ratio. This metric is found by dividing a stock's price with the company's revenue. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. PARR has a P/S ratio of 0.18. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.29.Finally, our model also underscores that PARR has a P/CF ratio of 3.27. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook. PARR's P/CF compares to its industry's average P/CF of 5.02. Within the past 12 months, PARR's P/CF has been as high as 81.73 and as low as -19.79, with a median of 3.83.Story continuesPhillips 66 (PSX) may be another strong Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing stock to add to your shortlist.

113,50347fe8-c593-3f53-b840-c65fe3cdc7e2,PSX,2022-12-21,Is Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) Trading At A 22% Discount?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/phillips-66-nyse-psx-trading-135625136.html,1671544585,STORY,['PSX'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of Phillips 66 (NYSE:PSX) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Phillips 66 Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$5.00bUS$5.05bUS$5.12bUS$5.20bUS$5.28bUS$5.37bUS$5.47bUS$5.57bUS$5.68bUS$5.79bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x2Analyst x2Est @ 1.28%Est @ 1.49%Est @ 1.64%Est @ 1.74%Est @ 1.81%Est @ 1.86%Est @ 1.90%Est @ 1.92% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10.0% US$4.5kUS$4.2kUS$3.8kUS$3.5kUS$3.3kUS$3.0kUS$2.8kUS$2.6kUS$2.4kUS$2.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$32bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 10.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.8b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (10.0%– 2.0%) = US$74bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$74b÷ ( 1 + 10.0%)10= US$28bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$61b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$101, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 22% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Phillips 66 as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.439. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Phillips 66StrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.Shareholders have been diluted in the past year.OpportunityGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Phillips 66, we've compiled three additional aspects you should assess:Risks: Take risks, for example - Phillips 66 has   4 warning signs  (and 1 which is concerning)  we think you should know about.Future Earnings: How does PSX's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Newmont The CalculationWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.62bUS$2.06bUS$2.96bUS$3.61bUS$4.18bUS$4.67bUS$5.08bUS$5.43bUS$5.72bUS$5.96bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x6Analyst x2Est @ 21.82%Est @ 15.87%Est @ 11.70%Est @ 8.79%Est @ 6.74%Est @ 5.31%Est @ 4.31% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.5% US$1.5kUS$1.7kUS$2.3kUS$2.6kUS$2.8kUS$2.9kUS$2.9kUS$2.8kUS$2.7kUS$2.6k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 8.5%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.0b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (8.5%– 2.0%) = US$93bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$93b÷ ( 1 + 8.5%)10= US$41bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$66b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$45.6, the company appears quite undervalued at a 45% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Newmont as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.5%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.171. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for NewmontStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Trading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.ThreatDividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

PSE&amp;G received this national honor for its leadership in support of advancing EV infrastructure in the state. PSE&amp;G has committed to make using an EV in New Jersey more affordable and convenient.PSE&amp;G is the first New Jersey utility to support the creation of the State's EV charging infrastructure through a $166 million investment dedicated to installing 45,000 EV chargers throughout its service territory for residential, commercial and direct current fast charge (DCFC) EV charging.The state-approved program helps qualified customers with the installation costs of EV chargers and alleviates some or all of the costs associated with upgrading their electric service. It does so by supporting increased electric usage, offering demand charge rebates for DCFC sites, and giving off-peak charging credits to residential customers by decreasing a charger's energy use during peak hours. This program supports the state's broader electrification efforts.""At PSE&amp;G, we are powering a future where people use less energy, and it's cleaner, safer and delivered more reliably than ever,"" said Dawn Neville, manager of electric transportation at PSE&amp;G.

The timing of Indonesia's ban, however, is in line with its current mining law.The president said the bauxite ban aimed to replicate Indonesia's success in developing its nickel processing capacity after halting exports of its raw form in January 2020, which enticed foreign investors, mostly from China, to build local smelters.The measure, which led to a dispute at the World Trade Organization (WTO), also helped boost the value of Indonesia's exports.""The government will remain consistent in implementing downstreaming so the value add can be enjoyed domestically for the country's development and people's welfare,"" said Widodo, who is popularly known as Jokowi, emphasising the importance of jobs creation.China was the biggest importer of Indonesia's bauxite until Jakarta introduced a mineral export ban in 2014, which it lifted in 2017.According to Wen Xianjun, a former head of the aluminium department at the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, Indonesia's 2014 ban prompted China to boost its efforts to develop aluminium resources in Africa instead.""Compared with then, China's imports of bauxite are more diversified now,"" Wen said.China imported 17.8 million tonnes of Indonesian bauxite in 2021, and 17.98 million tonnes in the first 11 months this year, about 15.6% of its total imports, according to customs data.Story continuesLIMITED PRICE IMPACTThe three-month aluminium futures contract on the London Metal Exchange rose 0.6% at $2,386.50 a tonne by 0530 GMT, while the most-traded aluminium contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was up 0.2% to 18,595 yuan a tonne.The announcement by Indonesia is not expected to have significant impact on prices.""It won't cause any major supply headwind as Indonesia now only accounts for a relatively small share of China's supply, Guinea and Australia will immediately make up the lost volume (after the ban),"" an aluminium trader at a large trading house in China said.Indonesia has four bauxite processing facilities with 4.3 million tonnes of alumina output capacity, while more are under construction with collective capacity of nearly 5 million tonnes, said chief economic minister Airlangga Hartarto.Indonesia's bauxite reserves are enough for up to 100 years production, he said.The country's mining law also states exports of other unprocessed minerals such as copper will also be stopped. Jokowi did not specify the timing of shipment bans on the other materials.He said there was a possibility that legal action could be pursued against Indonesia for banning bauxite exports, but it would not deter him. The WTO last month ruled in favour of the European Union in a dispute on nickel ore exports, which Indonesia is appealing.(Reporting by Fransiska Nangoy, Bernadette Christina, Stanley Widianto, Ananda Teresia; Additional reporting Siyi Liu; Writing by Fransiska Nangoy, Gayatri Suroyo; Editing by Martin Petty and Christian Schmollinger)]"

This was triggered by the Bank of Japan unexpectedly tweaking its ultra-loose monetary policy for the first time in nearly a decade.The BOJ increased the range within which the yields on benchmark Japanese government bonds are allowed to fluctuate, signaling that it may be open to tightening policy next year.The move follows hawkish signals from several other developed market central banks, and indicates that global interest rates are likely to rise further in 2023. While such a scenario bodes poorly for non-yielding assets such as gold, the prospect of an ensuing economic slowdown also boosted the yellow metal’s safe haven appeal.Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,819.67 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,828.55 an ounce by 20:11 ET (01:11 GMT). Both instruments surged nearly 2% on Tuesday, and were trading at a one-week high.Softer-than-expected U.S. housing data also ramped up fears of a recession in 2023- a scenario that could benefit gold, amid some speculation that the Federal Reserve is close to ending its cycle of interest rate hikes.This has seen the dollar relinquish a chunk of its gains this year. The greenback is now trading near six-month lows, after the Fed raised interest rates by a relatively smaller margin earlier this month.Still, investors remain uncertain over where U.S. interest rates will peak. Hawkish signals from other major central banks have also brewed uncertainty over monetary policy going into 2023.Other precious metals rallied on Tuesday and were trading steady on Wednesday.Among industrial metals, copper prices rose 0.3% to $3.8178 a pound on Wednesday, after jumping 0.7% in the previous session.Story continuesBut gains in the red metal were constrained by growing uncertainty over an economic reopening in major importer China, which is struggling with an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 infections.Fears of a potential recession in 2023 have also weighed on copper prices in recent sessions, given the metal’s close relationship with economic growth.Related ArticlesGold blazes past $1,800 as dollar sinks on BOJ policy shiftOil rises past U.S. storm jitters as inventories shrinkU.S. expands dispute settlement consultations over Canadian dairy tariff policies]"

Brazil led the advance, with its real up 1.7% against a weaker dollar, while Sao Paulo's Bovespa stock index gained 2.4% to hit a one-week high. Top Brazilian miner Vale rose 0.7%, while state-owned oil giant Petrobras gained 2.8%%. Prices of oil, industrial and precious metals rose, lifting assets of most commodity-export oriented countries in Central and South America. The Brazilian Supreme Court on Monday granted an injunction allowing President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to increase social investment, while outlawing an opaque congressional spending program. Fitch affirmed Brazil's rating at ""BB-"" with a stable outlook. Chile's peso and Peru's sol added 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, tracking firm copper prices. The Mexican peso was subdued, with investors nervous ahead of Mexico's inflation data this week. Headline inflation for Mexico is forecast to have rebounded in the first half of December after six fortnights of slowing, a Reuters poll showed, backing bets the Bank of Mexico will continue to hike interest rates. The Chilean economy faces a period of adjustment in the next two years to correct accumulated debts and bring down inflation, the central bank chief said. The MSCI's index for Latin American stocks gained 2.9%, against a 0.6% fall in the broader emerging markets equity index. ""The U.S. Federal Reserve actually out-hiked most EMs in Q4, compressing the policy rate differentials with all EM region,"" said Natalia Gurushina, emerging markets fixed income chief economist at VanEck in a note. ""This might be less of a problem in Latam, where the policy differential is still the widest. However, it remains to be seen whether this would be enough to compensate for the political noise and policy uncertainty in the region."" Most Asian and European markets were left reeling after Japan's central bank widened the allowable band for long-term yields to 50 basis points either side of its 0% target, from 25 basis points previously. The move stunned investors already worried about the economic fallout of rising interest rates and surging inflation, and was seen by many as a possible end to Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy. ""It's important not to underestimate the impact this could have, because tighter BoJ policy would remove one of the last global anchors that has helped to keep borrowing costs at low levels more broadly,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Henry Allen said in a client note. Also weighing on global sentiment was a surge in coronavirus infections in China, with many fearing a new wave of infections could further hit corporate supply chains. Stocks in China ended lower. China kept benchmark lending interest rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. Among other emerging markets, Hungary's forint slipped 0.2% against the euro after the country's central bank left interest rates unchanged.

Twenty-three constituents remained in CNE the entire fourth quarter and they all lost.Best performer: Adventure Gold, the native token of the NFT project Loot, lost 10.4% and is part of the DACS Gaming Industry assigned to the Metaverse Industry Group. It has leaned heavily on its non-fungible tokens (NFT) being free to use however folks please. As such, any new project looking to incorporate Loot tends to have a positive effect on the price of AGLD. This time it would appear to be a game called Endless Crawler.Worst performer: Rally (RLY), the token of the social tokens platform, lost 53% and is part of the DACS Social Industry assigned to the Media Industry Group. It dropped over 30% in the days after the FTX collapse and hasn’t been able to recover since. However, both Adventure Gold and Rally are relatively small, with a combined total weight just over 0.8% of CNE at the end of the period.Biggest asset: ApeCoin is the biggest asset in CNE, comprising 21.4% of the sector. While APE lost 26.0% QTD, it ranked as the fifth-best performing asset in the sector.

As per an outlook survey by Deloitte, 88% of senior executives noted that the business outlook for the aerospace and defense industry in 2023 is “somewhat to very positive.” The reasons for their optimism included developments in new technologies and segments like advanced air mobility, evolution of business models and greater exploration of space, and the use of digital thread and smart factories. According to Fitch Ratings, the Aerospace &amp; Defense outlook is improving, and feasible demand patterns should result in growing cash flows and deleveraging capacity starting in 2023. Fitch thinks commercial aircraft manufacturers and suppliers will be beneficiaries of robust global demand for new aircraft fleets as world travel recovers to pre-pandemic levels, despite the current recessionary threats looming ahead. Fitch sees deliveries of new large commercial aircrafts increasing by over 20% as compared to 2022, resulting in greater free cash flow and financial freedom for OEMs. Production rates should remain comparatively normal during the first half of next year, but could heighten towards the end of 2023. The aerospace industry is well positioned for long-term growth as the geopolitical environment remains unstable and defense capabilities around the world are being strengthened. Some of the best aerospace stocks to invest in include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX). Our Methodology We selected the following aerospace stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continues11 Best Aerospace Stocks To BuyJirat Teparaksa/Shutterstock.comBest Aerospace Stocks To Buy11. AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, and the company designs, develops, delivers, and supports robotic systems for government agencies and businesses in the United States and internationally. The company operates through four segments – Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Tactical Missile System, Medium Unmanned Aircraft Systems, and High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite Systems. On December 7, Canaccord analyst Austin Moeller raised the price target on AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) to $106 from $105 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst noted that Q3 revenues missed his estimates due to an unfeasible mix and an impact on gross margins from $4 million in amortization of intangibles but the company lifted its 2023 top-line guidance on the back of high demand for both the Puma Small UAS and the Switchblade 300 and 600 loitering munitions.According to Insider Monkey’s data, AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) was part of 18 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2022, up from 10 in the prior quarter. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 750,191 shares worth $62.5 million. Like Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) is one of the best aerospace stocks to invest in. 10. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) is a Colorado-based company that designs, manufactures, and services control solutions for the aerospace and industrial markets worldwide. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD)’s Aerospace segment provides fuel pumps, metering units, actuators, air valves, specialty valves, fuel nozzles, thrust reverser actuation systems, flight deck controls, actuators, servocontrols, motors, and sensors for aircrafts. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) is one of the best aerospace stocks to invest in. On November 17, Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.84 and a revenue of $640 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.10 and $13.45 million, respectively. The company expects total net sales for fiscal 2023 to be between $2.60 billion and $2.75 billion, versus a consensus of $2.37 billion. Aerospace sales growth percentage is forecasted to be between 14%-19%. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) expects earnings per share to be between $3.15 and $3.60. Truist analyst Michael Ciarmoli on November 18 raised the price target on Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) to $88 from $80 but kept a Hold rating on the shares. The company's Q3 revenue outperformed expectations and its FY23 guidance was better than consensus but high interest, incentive comp, weak industrial margins, and R&amp;D expense drove worse than anticipated earnings and free cash flow outlook, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 19 hedge funds were long Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD), compared to 18 funds in the earlier quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 4.3 million shares worth $348 million. Here is what Carillon Eagle Small Cap Growth Fund has to say about Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Woodward (NASDAQ:WWD) develops and produces control systems and energy conversion solutions and components for the aerospace and industrial end markets. The company’s stock was a strong performer in the quarter, as the end markets it serves began recovering in the second half of 2021 from a COVID-induced slowdown. Woodward’s relatively high exposure to narrow-body commercial jets should be a positive in the near-term, as narrow-body manufacturing, along with the demand for Woodward’s aftermarket components, is seeing a quicker recovery and is a growing share of the total fleet over their wide-body counterparts. Current energy and power demand is driving growth in power generation, as well as oil, gas, and alternative fuels, which has benefited the industrial side of the business.”9. Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) was founded in 1946 and is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. The company develops, manufactures, and markets structural materials for use in commercial aerospace, space and defense, and industrial markets. It operates through two segments, Composite Materials and Engineered Products. Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) expects EPS for full-year 2022 of $1.12-$1.24 versus the prior guidance of $1.00-$1.24, which is still in line with the $1.23 analyst consensus, but narrowed full-year revenue guidance to $1.53 billion-$1.6 billion from $1.50 billion-$1.63 billion previously. However, the new revenue guidance is still in line with the $1.59 billion consensus.BMO Capital analyst John McNulty on November 1 maintained a Market Perform rating on Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) and lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $61 from $66. The company's Q3 results were ""more modest than expected"", but its earnings recovery from the COVID-19 lows continues to improve, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 21 hedge funds were long Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL), compared to 25 funds in the prior quarter. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.05 million shares worth $54.5 million. Here is what LRT Capital Management has to say about Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Hexcel manufactures carbon fiber composite materials with the primary end markets being aerospace and defense. The company’s stock price was hit heavily last year due to the decline in the aerospace market, but the stock is making an impressive comeback this year as the outlook for travel and aerospace demand improves. The near-term demand for lightweight, high-performance carbon fiber composites is still uncertain, but the longer-term trend is clearly very strong. As airplane manufacturers look to improve the fuel efficiency and performance of their planes, the primary way of doing this is to reduce weight. The 787, 777X and A350 are just the most recent examples of planes from Boeing and Airbus that utilize an increasing amount of carbon fiber materials in their construction. Just as is the case with Marriott, we do not view recent results as meaningful or indicative of a long-term trend, but rather a once in a century aberration due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Once Covid-19 recedes, we expect the demand for more fuel-efficient planes to return rather quickly, powering the demand for the company’s light weight carbon composites.”8. Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) was founded in 1923 and is headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island. The company operates in the aircraft, defense, industrial, and finance businesses. Textron Inc.

(NYSE:TXT)’s Bell V-280 by the U.S. Army, could be a ""$66 billion revenue generator through 2050"", adding $11 to Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) stock's net present value. The analyst also contended that its V-280 tilt rotor is a ""structurally better aircraft"" as the decision to award the contract to Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) came despite the ""very strong"" showing from Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky team.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 28 hedge funds were long Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 23 funds in the prior quarter.

The dividend yield on December 20 came in at 2.06%. Citi analyst Jason Gursky initiated coverage of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) on December 8 with a Buy rating and a $298 price target.

James A. Star’s Longview Asset Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 30 million shares worth $6.3 billion. Here is what Oakmark Global Fund has to say about General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“The second new U.S. equity purchase was General Dynamics, a leading U.S. defense contractor and owner of the world’s premier business jet franchise (Gulfstream). We were able to purchase this high-quality and durable business at a meaningful discount to our estimate of its intrinsic value after a series of near-term concerns hurt its share price. Taking a longer term view, the company’s business jet franchise should benefit from a multi-year investment program in new, differentiated products. Also, its free cash flow conversion is set to improve materially and the company is poised to benefit from a highly visible ramp up in revenue related to next generation nuclear-powered submarines. As these positives come into clearer view, we expect sentiment to improve, along with the company’s share price.”6. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) was incorporated in 1916 and is based in Chicago, Illinois. The company designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and supports commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems, and related services worldwide.

(NASDAQ:UAL) agreed to buy 100 twin-aisle 787 Dreamliners, with an option to buy 100 more. The carrier also will buy 100 of Boeing’s 737 MAX single-aisle jets.Susquehanna analyst Charles Minervino raised the price target on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) on December 14 to $217 from $185 and kept a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst updated his model to factor in November's order and delivery data. He remains optimistic as high profile orders provide further evidence of a solid commercial aerospace demand outlook. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 42 hedge funds were bullish on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 51 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.5 million shares worth $178.5 million. In addition to Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), elite investors are piling into The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) for exposure to the aerospace industry. Meridian Funds made the following comment about The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favor The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) , a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Best Wine Stocks To Buy13 Best Materials Stocks To Buy11 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 11 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Recovery initiatives in the region were dull in 2021, as most countries maintained tight border restrictions. However, the report by World Travel &amp; Tourism Council demonstrates that the Asia-Pacific is forecasted to bridge the gap this year, and travel revenue contribution to the economy will increase by nearly 71%. Travel restrictions were first lifted in India and Australia, followed by Malaysia, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian countries. Later, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also opened up. The report suggests ongoing gains to Asia-Pacific’s travel sector in 2023, and the year after that is also expected to bring positive growth in the industry. By 2025, travel revenue will provide 32% more to the Asian GDP than it did pre-pandemic.As per a Bloomberg report dated December 13, China’s swift reopening and easing of Covid Zero policies has initiated a solid rebound in the world’s largest domestic air travel market, which is a positive catalyst for the ‘Big Three’ Chinese airlines, which have suffered billions of dollars in losses since the beginning of the pandemic.

We participated in the company’s investor day in September 2021 and remain encouraged by management’s four-year growth plan, which includes expectations to grow earnings at a compound annual growth rate of 17% to 22%.

The auto industry continues to navigate supply chain challenges while confronted by several markets facing deteriorating economic conditions and fading pent-up demand. As semiconductor availability plays out, demand destruction is expected to take a more fundamental role in 2023, impacting production and the inventory restocking cycle.(PRNewsfoto/S&amp;P Global)Global new light vehicle sales will reach nearly 83.6 million units in 2023, a 5.6% increase year-over-year.S&amp;P Global Mobility remains wary on recovery prospects. Destroyed demand is a key feature of the tepid forecast outlook – impacted by a blend of general economic impacts, higher interest rates, tight supply chains, an intensifying affordability squeeze, higher new-car prices, weakening consumer confidence, and heightened energy price/supply concerns. Two trailing years of pent-up demand remains, but headwinds risk an orderly release—including patchy recovery patterns for semiconductor supply, energy risks (especially through a European winter), and logistics log jams. With the auto industry already operating at, or near, recessionary levels, the forecast outlook remains mixed at best.""2023 is expected to be a year of recovery, but likely a cautious one as the world approaches a gloomy trio of anniversaries – three years of COVID, two years of semiconductor disruption, and one year of Russia-Ukraine war impacts,"" said Colin Couchman, executive director, global light vehicle forecasting, S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""The rapid zero-COVID policy exit in mainland China provides further food for thought as we approach the New Year.""Story continuesFull-year 2022 light vehicle sales ­– projected to reach nearly 79.2 million units by S&amp;P Global Mobility – represent a 1.3% decline from 2021 levels.Market-by-market forecastsEurope: The European auto industry is suffering supply frictions, stalling economics, energy concerns, higher raw material/component prices, and wider security unease. Western/Central European 2022 vehicle sales should post 12.9 million units (-6.7% y/y). Order fulfilment remains a struggle, with long waiting lists, stretched lead times and challenging logistics. For 2023, the narrative shifts from supply constraints to demand destruction. With a mild recession looming for Western Europe, 2023 demand is forecasted at 13.9 million units (+7.4% y/y), according to S&amp;P Global Mobility.""For Europe, the evolving electrification transition adds further uncertainty, especially for vehicle prices, model availability, wait-and-see customers, and lurking Chinese OEMs,"" Couchman said.United States: US sales volumes are expected to reach 14.8 million units in 2023, an estimated increase of 7.0% from the projected 2022 level of 13.8 million units. ""The US auto market is struggling, impacted by supply chain, labor, logistics, inflation, and wider economic concerns,"" said Chris Hopson, manager, North American light vehicle sales forecast, S&amp;P Global Mobility.""Ongoing supply chain challenges and recessionary fears will result in a cautious build-back for the market. US consumers are hunkering down, and recovery towards pre-pandemic vehicle demand levels feels like a hard sell. Inventory and incentive activity will be key barometers to gauge potential demand destruction.""Mainland China:  S&amp;P Global Mobility analysts have rebalanced the outlook on the rapid zero-COVID policy exit, a still-weak economy, and ongoing stimulus. With 2022 set at 24.8 million units (+3.6% y/y), some demand fulfilment has been effectively delayed into 2023-24. For 2023, the CNY100 billion extension of NEV incentives and recovering local vehicle production should support domestic sales –2023 should see a recovery to 25.9 million units (+4.5% y/y), according to S&amp;P Global Mobility. The market faces significant uncertainty as COVID infection levels could potentially surge following the ease in COVID rules.Production recovery momentum eases for 2023Global light vehicle production in 2022 is expected to finish at 81.8 million units – a hard-fought 6.0% improvement over 2021 levels – in a year that has been defined once again by supply chain constraints, debilitating lockdowns in China and, since February, the spillover effects of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has intensified the risk of widespread recession.For 2023, S&amp;P Global Mobility forecasts continued growth in output even against a backdrop which looks more challenging than the last 12 months. Light vehicle production levels are expected to rise by 4.0%, to 85.0 million units. While we entered 2022 imagining a return to pre-pandemic levels of production would be achieved in 2023, this optimism is now postponed until 2025 at the earliest.In Mainland China, S&amp;P Global Mobility forecasts modest production growth for 2023 of 1.1 percent, to 26.4 million units. Europe is expected to produce 16.6 million units in 2023, up from an estimated 15.6 million this year. For the North American region, upside pressure surrounding restocking and fulfilling pent-up demand provides support moving into 2023, with the forecast set at close to 15.1 million units.Friction in the supply chain remains, not just involving semiconductors but also across labor and logistics – even if it is becoming harder to identify.The structural semiconductor capacity deficit will take years to solve. While the supply-side issues won't see any immediate relief, the demand side will bring some respite. More of the existing capacity in the sector has been allocated to automotive since the second half of 2022, which will continue into 2023 due to slowing demand in other chip-hungry industries like telecoms and consumer electronics.""These conditions may mask the ongoing capacity issues the auto industry faces,"" said Jeremie Bouchaud, director, semiconductor, E/E and autonomy practice, S&amp;P Global Mobility. ""The average chip content per car is increasing at an accelerated rate because of electrification, and the capacity deficit will resurface as soon as demand from other industries picks up again. The structural chip capacity deficit for cars will only be solved by 2024 at the earliest.""Though semiconductor availability remains an important consideration and continues to impact production operations, demand constraints are expected to play a more fundamental role and accelerate in second-half 2023 and into 2024, impacting production and influencing the speed and scale of inventory restocking.Another major variable is emerging in Mainland China.  While most of the world has adapted to living with COVID-19, the recent signals from Mainland China point towards a dichotomy that will be difficult to read. The recent relaxation of strict zero-COVID restrictions should free up businesses and services, but must be balanced against the increase in caseloads that will inevitably follow.""The response of individuals, central and regional governments to these developments will be critical to the direction of the world's largest market next year,"" said Mark Fulthorpe, executive director of light vehicle production forecasts, S&amp;P Global Mobility.Electrification looks unstoppable This year saw many OEMs double down on electrification ambitions for the coming five to 15 years, with 2022 seeing some carmakers dramatically scrambling to catch up. China's NEV policy, Europe's ""Fit for 55,"" and the USA's IRA have moved the goalposts, resulting in electrification becoming firmly embedded in policymakers' visions for a greener future for mobility.S&amp;P Global Mobility projects global demand for battery electric passenger vehicles is on track to hit almost 10 million units for 2023, accounting for an estimated 13.3% of global passenger vehicle demand.As many markets shift to greater levels of electrification, we expect vehicle pricing to be pressured to the upside, presenting a headwind to demand in the short-to-intermediate term. Longer-term questions remain, especially regarding charging infrastructure, grid power, battery supply chains, and the appropriate level of policymaker support to help smooth the transition from fossil fuel vehicles to electric vehicles.About S&amp;P Global Mobility www.spglobal.com/mobilityAt S&amp;P Global Mobility, we provide invaluable insights derived from unmatched automotive data, enabling our customers to anticipate change and make decisions with conviction.

The global leader in flavors is capitalizing on a sustained shift to cooking more at home, higher digital engagement, clean and flavorful eating and trusted brands. Its effective cost-saving plans are yielding amid rising inflationary pressure.Let’s delve deeper.Prudent Acquisitions Driving GrowthThe Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has been undertaking strategic acquisitions to drive growth. The company bought a 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some of its affiliates. FONA’s diverse portfolio helps McCormick bolster its value-add offerings and expand the flavor solutions segment into attractive categories. In November 2020, McCormick completed the acquisition of the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce — a premium Mexico-based hot sauce brand. McCormick believes that the buyout of Cholula accelerates its growth potential across the condiment platform and widens the product portfolio in the hot sauce category.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSeveral other companies in the food space, like The Kraft Heinz Company KHC, Hormel Foods Corporation HRL and Tyson Foods, Inc. TSN, are benefiting from acquisitions.In April 2022, Kraft Heinz acquired a majority stake in a Brazil-based condiments and sauces company — Companhia Hemmer Industria e Comercio (""Hemmer""). The buyout widened Kraft Heinz's International Taste Elevation platform and enhanced its presence across emerging markets. In January 2022, KHC acquired an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH (“Just Spices”). The buyout enhanced its direct-to-consumer operations and go-to-market expansion.Hormel Foods is strengthening its business through strategic acquisitions. In June, HRL acquired the Planters snacking portfolio from Kraft Heinz. Prior to this, it acquired Texas-based pit-smoked meats company Sadler's Smokehouse in March 2020. The buyout was in sync with Hormel Foods’ initiatives to strengthen its position in the foodservice space.Tyson Foods is focused on expanding into international markets as part of its strategic growth plan. In Jul 2022, TSN announced its strategic partnership with Tanmiah Food Company (Tanmiah) — a leading Middle East provider of fresh and processed poultry, other processed meat products, animal feed and health products. The acquisitions will allow Tyson Foods to access poultry supplies across Saudi Arabia to cater to the rising protein demand in the Middle East and other markets.Story continuesWhat Else is Working Well for McCormick?Meanwhile, McCormick regularly enhances products through innovation to remain competitive and tap the evolving demand for new flavors, spices and herbs. Aided by a sturdy brand image, McCormick enjoys strong retail acceptance for its new products. Additionally, the company is on track to augment robust marketing support for its products. New product launches are integral to the company’s growth. Management is leveraging its broad technology platform to develop clean-label, organic and better-for-you solutions amid rising consumer’s health consciousness.McCormick’s cost savings are likely to keep aiding growth. The company is focused on saving costs and enhancing productivity through the ongoing Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) program. Started in 2009, McCormick’s CCI program helped the company reduce costs and enhance productivity. It has used CCI savings to increase investments, leading to higher sales and profits. Management expects to achieve CCI-led cost savings of nearly $85 million in 2022.We believe that such well-chalked saving efforts and the aforementioned upsides will likely keep McCormick well-positioned in the food space.MKC’s stock has increased 7.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 7.9% growth.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The timing of Indonesia's ban, however, is in line with its current mining law.The president said the bauxite ban aimed to replicate Indonesia's success in developing its nickel processing capacity after halting exports of its raw form in January 2020, which enticed foreign investors, mostly from China, to build local smelters.The measure, which led to a dispute at the World Trade Organization (WTO), also helped boost the value of Indonesia's exports.""The government will remain consistent in implementing downstreaming so the value add can be enjoyed domestically for the country's development and people's welfare,"" said Widodo, who is popularly known as Jokowi, emphasising the importance of jobs creation.China was the biggest importer of Indonesia's bauxite until Jakarta introduced a mineral export ban in 2014, which it lifted in 2017.According to Wen Xianjun, a former head of the aluminium department at the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, Indonesia's 2014 ban prompted China to boost its efforts to develop aluminium resources in Africa instead.""Compared with then, China's imports of bauxite are more diversified now,"" Wen said.China imported 17.8 million tonnes of Indonesian bauxite in 2021, and 17.98 million tonnes in the first 11 months this year, about 15.6% of its total imports, according to customs data.Story continuesLIMITED PRICE IMPACTThe three-month aluminium futures contract on the London Metal Exchange rose 0.6% at $2,386.50 a tonne by 0530 GMT, while the most-traded aluminium contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was up 0.2% to 18,595 yuan a tonne.The announcement by Indonesia is not expected to have significant impact on prices.""It won't cause any major supply headwind as Indonesia now only accounts for a relatively small share of China's supply, Guinea and Australia will immediately make up the lost volume (after the ban),"" an aluminium trader at a large trading house in China said.Indonesia has four bauxite processing facilities with 4.3 million tonnes of alumina output capacity, while more are under construction with collective capacity of nearly 5 million tonnes, said chief economic minister Airlangga Hartarto.Indonesia's bauxite reserves are enough for up to 100 years production, he said.The country's mining law also states exports of other unprocessed minerals such as copper will also be stopped. Jokowi did not specify the timing of shipment bans on the other materials.He said there was a possibility that legal action could be pursued against Indonesia for banning bauxite exports, but it would not deter him.

This was triggered by the Bank of Japan unexpectedly tweaking its ultra-loose monetary policy for the first time in nearly a decade.The BOJ increased the range within which the yields on benchmark Japanese government bonds are allowed to fluctuate, signaling that it may be open to tightening policy next year.The move follows hawkish signals from several other developed market central banks, and indicates that global interest rates are likely to rise further in 2023. While such a scenario bodes poorly for non-yielding assets such as gold, the prospect of an ensuing economic slowdown also boosted the yellow metal’s safe haven appeal.Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,819.67 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,828.55 an ounce by 20:11 ET (01:11 GMT). Both instruments surged nearly 2% on Tuesday, and were trading at a one-week high.Softer-than-expected U.S. housing data also ramped up fears of a recession in 2023- a scenario that could benefit gold, amid some speculation that the Federal Reserve is close to ending its cycle of interest rate hikes.This has seen the dollar relinquish a chunk of its gains this year. The greenback is now trading near six-month lows, after the Fed raised interest rates by a relatively smaller margin earlier this month.Still, investors remain uncertain over where U.S. interest rates will peak. Hawkish signals from other major central banks have also brewed uncertainty over monetary policy going into 2023.Other precious metals rallied on Tuesday and were trading steady on Wednesday.Among industrial metals, copper prices rose 0.3% to $3.8178 a pound on Wednesday, after jumping 0.7% in the previous session.Story continuesBut gains in the red metal were constrained by growing uncertainty over an economic reopening in major importer China, which is struggling with an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 infections.Fears of a potential recession in 2023 have also weighed on copper prices in recent sessions, given the metal’s close relationship with economic growth.Related ArticlesGold blazes past $1,800 as dollar sinks on BOJ policy shiftOil rises past U.S. storm jitters as inventories shrinkU.S. expands dispute settlement consultations over Canadian dairy tariff policies]"

Brazil led the advance, with its real up 1.7% against a weaker dollar, while Sao Paulo's Bovespa stock index gained 2.4% to hit a one-week high. Top Brazilian miner Vale rose 0.7%, while state-owned oil giant Petrobras gained 2.8%%. Prices of oil, industrial and precious metals rose, lifting assets of most commodity-export oriented countries in Central and South America. The Brazilian Supreme Court on Monday granted an injunction allowing President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to increase social investment, while outlawing an opaque congressional spending program. Fitch affirmed Brazil's rating at ""BB-"" with a stable outlook. Chile's peso and Peru's sol added 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, tracking firm copper prices. The Mexican peso was subdued, with investors nervous ahead of Mexico's inflation data this week. Headline inflation for Mexico is forecast to have rebounded in the first half of December after six fortnights of slowing, a Reuters poll showed, backing bets the Bank of Mexico will continue to hike interest rates. The Chilean economy faces a period of adjustment in the next two years to correct accumulated debts and bring down inflation, the central bank chief said. The MSCI's index for Latin American stocks gained 2.9%, against a 0.6% fall in the broader emerging markets equity index. ""The U.S. Federal Reserve actually out-hiked most EMs in Q4, compressing the policy rate differentials with all EM region,"" said Natalia Gurushina, emerging markets fixed income chief economist at VanEck in a note. ""This might be less of a problem in Latam, where the policy differential is still the widest. However, it remains to be seen whether this would be enough to compensate for the political noise and policy uncertainty in the region."" Most Asian and European markets were left reeling after Japan's central bank widened the allowable band for long-term yields to 50 basis points either side of its 0% target, from 25 basis points previously. The move stunned investors already worried about the economic fallout of rising interest rates and surging inflation, and was seen by many as a possible end to Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy. ""It's important not to underestimate the impact this could have, because tighter BoJ policy would remove one of the last global anchors that has helped to keep borrowing costs at low levels more broadly,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Henry Allen said in a client note. Also weighing on global sentiment was a surge in coronavirus infections in China, with many fearing a new wave of infections could further hit corporate supply chains. Stocks in China ended lower. China kept benchmark lending interest rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. Among other emerging markets, Hungary's forint slipped 0.2% against the euro after the country's central bank left interest rates unchanged.

Inclusion of a digital asset in CNE is subject to minimum trading and exchange eligibility requirements. CNE reflects the DACS as of the prior month, so the Culture &amp; Entertainment sector includes all projects that aim to decentralize social media platforms, create decentralized gaming worlds and increase direct peer-to-peer interaction between content creators and their audience, while at the same time maintain user privacy, security and ownership of data and digital assets.As of Dec 15, 2022, CNE lost 35.2% for the quarter to date, and included 25 digital assets assigned to six industries in three industry groups according to the CoinDesk Digital Asset Classification Standard (DACS). Twenty-three constituents remained in CNE the entire fourth quarter and they all lost.Best performer: Adventure Gold, the native token of the NFT project Loot, lost 10.4% and is part of the DACS Gaming Industry assigned to the Metaverse Industry Group. It has leaned heavily on its non-fungible tokens (NFT) being free to use however folks please. As such, any new project looking to incorporate Loot tends to have a positive effect on the price of AGLD. This time it would appear to be a game called Endless Crawler.Worst performer: Rally (RLY), the token of the social tokens platform, lost 53% and is part of the DACS Social Industry assigned to the Media Industry Group. It dropped over 30% in the days after the FTX collapse and hasn’t been able to recover since. However, both Adventure Gold and Rally are relatively small, with a combined total weight just over 0.8% of CNE at the end of the period.Biggest asset: ApeCoin is the biggest asset in CNE, comprising 21.4% of the sector. While APE lost 26.0% QTD, it ranked as the fifth-best performing asset in the sector. It has fluctuated wildly this quarter, swinging to new lows on the back of reports of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) probe in October, and then rebounding considerably on the launch of its staking service in mid-December.Story continuesAlso notable: Virtual reality and gaming platform Decentraland’s MANA token was down 46%.Read more: CoinDesk Market Outlook: 4Q Crypto Gloom Spills Into 2023Commentary and outlookThe crypto market slowdown loomed over the Culture and Entertainment sector, consisting largely of digital artistic creations, collectibles and applications such as non-fungible tokens (NFT) and metaverse.Data from Dune Analytics shows that volume in NFTs fell to $3.3 billion QTD, from $8.3 billion in the fourth quarter of 2021 – a 59% decrease.Despite the crypto chill, a melding of the metaverse and blockchain gaming communities has brought a silver lining for many builders, with the forming this year of an “Open Metaverse Alliance of Web3” that aims to address interoperability challenges, according to Saro McKenna, co-founder and CEO of Dacoco, publisher of blockchain game Alien Worlds.“Resiliency of all kinds” might be the bywords for 2023 as developers continue to build more “open products that are interoperable with each other,” she said. “The different gaming and metaverse environments are trying to connect up and allow users to go between the different metaverses carrying their identities and their history with them.”More from this report(Fourth quarter performance as of Dec 15, 2022.)The CoinDesk Currency Index, Excluding Stablecoins (CCX)The CoinDesk Smart Contract Platform Index (SMT)The CoinDesk DeFi Index (DCF)The CoinDesk Computing Index (CPU)The CoinDesk Digitization Index (DTZ)]"

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy. Economic recovery for the aerospace and defense sector gained momentum in 2022 on the back of increasing demand for air travel. As per an outlook survey by Deloitte, 88% of senior executives noted that the business outlook for the aerospace and defense industry in 2023 is “somewhat to very positive.” The reasons for their optimism included developments in new technologies and segments like advanced air mobility, evolution of business models and greater exploration of space, and the use of digital thread and smart factories. According to Fitch Ratings, the Aerospace &amp; Defense outlook is improving, and feasible demand patterns should result in growing cash flows and deleveraging capacity starting in 2023. Fitch thinks commercial aircraft manufacturers and suppliers will be beneficiaries of robust global demand for new aircraft fleets as world travel recovers to pre-pandemic levels, despite the current recessionary threats looming ahead. Fitch sees deliveries of new large commercial aircrafts increasing by over 20% as compared to 2022, resulting in greater free cash flow and financial freedom for OEMs. Production rates should remain comparatively normal during the first half of next year, but could heighten towards the end of 2023. The aerospace industry is well positioned for long-term growth as the geopolitical environment remains unstable and defense capabilities around the world are being strengthened. Some of the best aerospace stocks to invest in include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX). Our Methodology We selected the following aerospace stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continues11 Best Aerospace Stocks To BuyJirat Teparaksa/Shutterstock.comBest Aerospace Stocks To Buy11. AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, and the company designs, develops, delivers, and supports robotic systems for government agencies and businesses in the United States and internationally. The company operates through four segments – Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Tactical Missile System, Medium Unmanned Aircraft Systems, and High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite Systems. On December 7, Canaccord analyst Austin Moeller raised the price target on AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) to $106 from $105 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst noted that Q3 revenues missed his estimates due to an unfeasible mix and an impact on gross margins from $4 million in amortization of intangibles but the company lifted its 2023 top-line guidance on the back of high demand for both the Puma Small UAS and the Switchblade 300 and 600 loitering munitions.According to Insider Monkey’s data, AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) was part of 18 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2022, up from 10 in the prior quarter. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 750,191 shares worth $62.5 million. Like Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) is one of the best aerospace stocks to invest in. 10. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) is a Colorado-based company that designs, manufactures, and services control solutions for the aerospace and industrial markets worldwide. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD)’s Aerospace segment provides fuel pumps, metering units, actuators, air valves, specialty valves, fuel nozzles, thrust reverser actuation systems, flight deck controls, actuators, servocontrols, motors, and sensors for aircrafts. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) is one of the best aerospace stocks to invest in. On November 17, Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.84 and a revenue of $640 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.10 and $13.45 million, respectively. The company expects total net sales for fiscal 2023 to be between $2.60 billion and $2.75 billion, versus a consensus of $2.37 billion. Aerospace sales growth percentage is forecasted to be between 14%-19%. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) expects earnings per share to be between $3.15 and $3.60. Truist analyst Michael Ciarmoli on November 18 raised the price target on Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) to $88 from $80 but kept a Hold rating on the shares. The company's Q3 revenue outperformed expectations and its FY23 guidance was better than consensus but high interest, incentive comp, weak industrial margins, and R&amp;D expense drove worse than anticipated earnings and free cash flow outlook, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 19 hedge funds were long Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD), compared to 18 funds in the earlier quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 4.3 million shares worth $348 million. Here is what Carillon Eagle Small Cap Growth Fund has to say about Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Woodward (NASDAQ:WWD) develops and produces control systems and energy conversion solutions and components for the aerospace and industrial end markets. The company’s stock was a strong performer in the quarter, as the end markets it serves began recovering in the second half of 2021 from a COVID-induced slowdown. Woodward’s relatively high exposure to narrow-body commercial jets should be a positive in the near-term, as narrow-body manufacturing, along with the demand for Woodward’s aftermarket components, is seeing a quicker recovery and is a growing share of the total fleet over their wide-body counterparts. Current energy and power demand is driving growth in power generation, as well as oil, gas, and alternative fuels, which has benefited the industrial side of the business.”9. Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) was founded in 1946 and is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. The company develops, manufactures, and markets structural materials for use in commercial aerospace, space and defense, and industrial markets. It operates through two segments, Composite Materials and Engineered Products. Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) expects EPS for full-year 2022 of $1.12-$1.24 versus the prior guidance of $1.00-$1.24, which is still in line with the $1.23 analyst consensus, but narrowed full-year revenue guidance to $1.53 billion-$1.6 billion from $1.50 billion-$1.63 billion previously. However, the new revenue guidance is still in line with the $1.59 billion consensus.BMO Capital analyst John McNulty on November 1 maintained a Market Perform rating on Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) and lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $61 from $66. The company's Q3 results were ""more modest than expected"", but its earnings recovery from the COVID-19 lows continues to improve, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 21 hedge funds were long Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL), compared to 25 funds in the prior quarter. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.05 million shares worth $54.5 million. Here is what LRT Capital Management has to say about Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Hexcel manufactures carbon fiber composite materials with the primary end markets being aerospace and defense. The company’s stock price was hit heavily last year due to the decline in the aerospace market, but the stock is making an impressive comeback this year as the outlook for travel and aerospace demand improves. The near-term demand for lightweight, high-performance carbon fiber composites is still uncertain, but the longer-term trend is clearly very strong. As airplane manufacturers look to improve the fuel efficiency and performance of their planes, the primary way of doing this is to reduce weight. The 787, 777X and A350 are just the most recent examples of planes from Boeing and Airbus that utilize an increasing amount of carbon fiber materials in their construction. Just as is the case with Marriott, we do not view recent results as meaningful or indicative of a long-term trend, but rather a once in a century aberration due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Once Covid-19 recedes, we expect the demand for more fuel-efficient planes to return rather quickly, powering the demand for the company’s light weight carbon composites.”8. Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) was founded in 1923 and is headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island. The company operates in the aircraft, defense, industrial, and finance businesses. Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)’s Aviation segment manufactures, sells, and services business jets, turboprop and piston engine aircrafts, military trainers, and defense aircrafts. It is one of the premier aerospace stocks to invest in. On December 5, Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu noted that the $80 billion future long-range assault aircraft program, awarded to Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)’s Bell V-280 by the U.S. Army, could be a ""$66 billion revenue generator through 2050"", adding $11 to Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) stock's net present value. The analyst also contended that its V-280 tilt rotor is a ""structurally better aircraft"" as the decision to award the contract to Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) came despite the ""very strong"" showing from Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky team.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 28 hedge funds were long Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 23 funds in the prior quarter. Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.18 million shares worth $185.7 million. 7. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is a Virginia-based aerospace and defense company.

The dividend is payable on February 10, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 20. The dividend yield on December 20 came in at 2.06%. Citi analyst Jason Gursky initiated coverage of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) on December 8 with a Buy rating and a $298 price target. The growth outlook for the aerospace segment is optimistic, given recent order trends and a backlog level that provides earnings visibility for the next several years, the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 35 hedge funds were long General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) at the end of September 2022, compared to 42 funds in the prior quarter. James A. Star’s Longview Asset Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 30 million shares worth $6.3 billion. Here is what Oakmark Global Fund has to say about General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“The second new U.S. equity purchase was General Dynamics, a leading U.S. defense contractor and owner of the world’s premier business jet franchise (Gulfstream). We were able to purchase this high-quality and durable business at a meaningful discount to our estimate of its intrinsic value after a series of near-term concerns hurt its share price. Taking a longer term view, the company’s business jet franchise should benefit from a multi-year investment program in new, differentiated products. Also, its free cash flow conversion is set to improve materially and the company is poised to benefit from a highly visible ramp up in revenue related to next generation nuclear-powered submarines. As these positives come into clearer view, we expect sentiment to improve, along with the company’s share price.”6. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) was incorporated in 1916 and is based in Chicago, Illinois. The company designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and supports commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems, and related services worldwide. The company operates through four segments – Commercial Airplanes, Defense, Space &amp; Security, Global Services, and Boeing Capital. On December 16, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) received the biggest order for commercial aircraft in history as United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) agreed to buy 100 twin-aisle 787 Dreamliners, with an option to buy 100 more. The carrier also will buy 100 of Boeing’s 737 MAX single-aisle jets.Susquehanna analyst Charles Minervino raised the price target on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) on December 14 to $217 from $185 and kept a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst updated his model to factor in November's order and delivery data. He remains optimistic as high profile orders provide further evidence of a solid commercial aerospace demand outlook. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 42 hedge funds were bullish on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 51 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.5 million shares worth $178.5 million. In addition to Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), elite investors are piling into The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) for exposure to the aerospace industry. Meridian Funds made the following comment about The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favor The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) , a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Best Wine Stocks To Buy13 Best Materials Stocks To Buy11 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 11 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The U.S. is nearing an overall total of 100 million cases, with more than 1.5 million cases seen over the last 28 days.Despite this uptick, one NYC-based physician is optimistic about how the U.S. will fare throughout the winter, thanks to the development of booster shots.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.“With the bivalent boosters that we have, it’s been very tremendous in lowering the hospitalization rates,” Dr. Calvin Sun, an attending physician in emergency medicine and author of ""The Monsoon Diaries,"" told Yahoo Finance Live (video above), adding that this year's flu shots have also reduced hospitalization.Sun compared vaccines to seatbelts in that they don’t prevent a negative outcome entirely but do significantly reduce the severity of it. The bivalent booster shot, in particular, targets the original strain of the coronavirus as well as the Omicron variant, which is able to evade earlier versions of the vaccine.Despite the high number of COVID cases in the U.S. over the past month, only a fraction have resulted in hospitalization, according to the latest CDC data. The current seven-day average for hospitalization is 5,010, a 2.3% week-over-week increase.“I got both [the bivalent booster and flu shot] at the same time,” Sun said. “And now I’m doing great. That was two months ago. And I haven’t gotten sick, even though I’m constantly exposed to people who are sick and have symptoms. I haven’t gotten it yet. And if I were, I know that the severity would be lessened to the point where I don’t have to worry I’ll end up in the hospital.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.'That's on your conscience'Despite early progress, vaccine and booster uptake has slowed in recent weeks.So far, 68.9% of the U.S. population — and 78.7% of those over the age of 18 — have completed a “primary series” of COVID vaccines, meaning they either received a single dose of the Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) vaccine or were double vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine such as those from Pfizer (PFE), Novavax (NVAX), and Moderna (MRNA).Story continuesYet just 14.1% of the population (and 16.3% of those 18+) have gotten the updated bivalent booster shot.“Obviously we live in a country where if you’re being told what to do, you may get a backlash and a worse outcome when people — out of defiance or pride or fear — do the opposite of what you would recommend,” Sun said.Sun explained that he takes a different approach to convey the importance of vaccines.“No one’s forcing you or looking over your shoulder or arresting you or doing whatever that you’re afraid they might be doing to you if you don’t do something,” he said. “It’s just on your conscience.”But, he added, “there are consequences. And if Grandma gets sick and dies because you got her sick — because you refused to mask around her out of pride or fear or whatever it is or you decide not to get vaccinated when you visit your family and get Grandpa sick, and they’re in the hospital later on — those are vulnerable populations. That’s on your conscience.”A nurse prepares a Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for Jose Luis Sanchez at a clinic on August 19, 2021 at Tournament House in Pasadena, California. (Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP)Vulnerable populations include the elderly, the very young, and those who are immunocompromised. Nearly 94% of those ages 65 and up have been fully vaccinated while 35.7% have received the bivalent booster dose.“You have to accept those consequences because you didn’t do something that you could have,” Sun said. “If you decide not to put on a seatbelt, there are consequences when bad things happen, and you have to own that consequence. When people hear it is this way, they do consider it a little more seriously. And that tips the needle a little bit. It does make a huge difference.”Maintaining a low hospitalization rate is key to containing the spread of the virus, Sun added. In the early days of the pandemic, most hospitals were extremely overwhelmed and lacked the capacity to meet demand.“We don’t want it to collapse because once we run out of beds, where are people going to go?” Sun said. “People are concerned because the vaccine doesn’t prevent all illness. Well, seatbelts don’t prevent all car accidents. Bulletproof vests don’t prevent getting shot. Helmets don’t prevent a brick falling on your head but do reduce the chances that you’re going to end up in a hospital and take up an otherwise necessary bed.”—Adriana Belmonte is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.

But in any portfolio, there are likely to be some stocks that fall short of that benchmark. We regret to report that long term Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 33% in three years, versus a market return of about 23%. And the ride hasn't got any smoother in recent times over the last year, with the price 24% lower in that time.It's worthwhile assessing if the company's economics have been moving in lockstep with these underwhelming shareholder returns, or if there is some disparity between the two. So let's do just that. View our latest analysis for Medtronic There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).During the three years that the share price fell, Medtronic's earnings per share (EPS) dropped by 2.9% each year. The share price decline of 12% is actually steeper than the EPS slippage. So it's likely that the EPS decline has disappointed the market, leaving investors hesitant to buy.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Medtronic's TSR for the last 3 years was -27%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveMedtronic shareholders are down 22% over twelve months (even including dividends), which isn't far from the market return of -21%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 1.2%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data remains strong, and the share price is simply down on sentiment, then this could be an opportunity worth investigating.

Median radiographic progression-free survival (rPFS) was 24.8 months for the LYNPARZA plus abiraterone arm (95% CI, 20.5, 27.6) versus 16.6 months for the placebo plus abiraterone arm (95% CI, 13.9, 19.2). A planned sensitivity analysis by blinded independent central review was consistent with the investigator-based analysis, with a median rPFS of 27.6 months for the LYNPARZA plus abiraterone arm compared to 16.4 months for the placebo plus abiraterone arm.Interim results for the key secondary efficacy endpoint of overall survival (OS) did not reach statistical significance, with an event rate of 37.1% in the LYNPARZA plus abiraterone arm versus 43.1% in the placebo plus abiraterone arm at the time of the analysis (HR=0.83 [95% CI, 0.66-1.03]).The safety and tolerability of LYNPARZA in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone was generally consistent with that of the individual medicines. Approximately 16% of patients who received LYNPARZA in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone discontinued treatment due to an adverse event (AE). As previously reported, based on an analysis from the PROpel trial presented earlier this year at the American Society of Clinical Oncology Genitourinary Cancers Symposium, the most common AEs (≥20%) were anemia (46%), fatigue (37%) and nausea (28%). Grade ≥3 AEs were anemia (15%), hypertension (4%), urinary tract infection (2%), fatigue (2%), decreased appetite (1%), vomiting (1%), back pain (1%), diarrhea (1%) and nausea (0.3%).Story continuesProstate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in Europe, with an estimated 473,000 cases and 108,000 deaths in 2020. Approximately 10-20% of patients with prostate cancer are estimated to develop castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) within five years, with at least 84% of these patients presenting with metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis. Patients diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer have a particularly poor prognosis, with a five-year relative survival rate of about 30%, compared to patients diagnosed with earlier stages of the disease, with a five-year relative survival rate of more than 99%.Noel Clarke, urological surgeon and professor of urological oncology at Manchester’s Christie/Salford Royal Hospitals and Manchester University, a senior investigator of the PROpel trial, said, ""The results of the PROpel Phase 3 trial of olaparib in combination with abiraterone as a first-line treatment show that this therapeutic combination can provide significant clinical benefit to patients with mCRPC. Patients with this condition in the EU will now, for the first time, have the opportunity to benefit from this new treatment combination.""Dave Fredrickson, executive vice president, oncology business unit, AstraZeneca, said, ""Many patients with mCRPC are only able to receive one line of active therapy, as the disease can progress quickly. LYNPARZA in combination with abiraterone has been shown to reduce the risk of disease progression by 34% versus the standard of care treatment in the PROpel trial. Moreover, the combination of LYNPARZA with abiraterone as a first-line treatment expands the use of LYNPARZA to a broader group of mCRPC patients than those treated with LYNPARZA alone in the second-line setting in the PROfound trial. Today’s approval marks a significant advance toward addressing the unmet need of patients with mCRPC in the EU.""Dr. Eliav Barr, senior vice president, head of global clinical development and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories, said, ""Merck is committed to developing new treatment options for patients with mCRPC, a complex disease that urgently needs more therapies. This approval by the European Commission marks another step toward delivering on that commitment, and we look forward to extending the benefits of LYNPARZA to more patients with mCRPC in the EU.""Use of LYNPARZA in combination with abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone is currently under review by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of adult patients with mCRPC. LYNPARZA is approved in the U.S. as monotherapy for patients with homologous recombination repair (HRR) gene-mutated mCRPC (BRCA-mutated and other HRR gene mutations) who have progressed following prior treatment with enzalutamide or abiraterone and in the EU, Japan and China for patients with BRCA-mutated mCRPC who have progressed following prior therapy that included a new hormonal agent (NHA). These approvals were based on the data from the Phase 3 PROfound trial.About PROpelPROpel is a randomized, double-blind Phase 3 trial testing the efficacy, safety and tolerability of LYNPARZA versus placebo when given in addition to abiraterone and prednisone or prednisolone in patients with mCRPC who had not received prior chemotherapy or NHAs in the mCRPC setting. The major efficacy outcome was rPFS as assessed by investigator per RECIST v1.1 and Prostate Cancer Working Group (bone) criteria. OS was an additional efficacy outcome measure.IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATIONCONTRAINDICATIONSThere are no contraindications for LYNPARZA.WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONSMyelodysplastic Syndrome/Acute Myeloid Leukemia (MDS/AML): Occurred in approximately 1.5% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and the majority of events had a fatal outcome. The median duration of therapy in patients who developed MDS/AML was 2 years (range: &lt;6 months to &gt;10 years). All of these patients had previous chemotherapy with platinum agents and/or other DNA-damaging agents, including radiotherapy.Do not start LYNPARZA until patients have recovered from hematological toxicity caused by previous chemotherapy (≤Grade 1). Monitor complete blood count for cytopenia at baseline and monthly thereafter for clinically significant changes during treatment. For prolonged hematological toxicities, interrupt LYNPARZA and monitor blood count weekly until recovery.If the levels have not recovered to Grade 1 or less after 4 weeks, refer the patient to a hematologist for further investigations, including bone marrow analysis and blood sample for cytogenetics. Discontinue LYNPARZA if MDS/AML is confirmed.Pneumonitis: Occurred in 0.8% of patients exposed to LYNPARZA monotherapy, and some cases were fatal. If patients present with new or worsening respiratory symptoms such as dyspnea, cough, and fever, or a radiological abnormality occurs, interrupt LYNPARZA treatment and initiate prompt investigation. Discontinue LYNPARZA if pneumonitis is confirmed and treat patient appropriately.Venous Thromboembolic Events (VTE): Including severe or fatal pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred in patients treated with LYNPARZA. VTE occurred in 7% of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who received LYNPARZA plus androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) compared to 3.1% of patients receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone plus ADT in the PROfound study. Patients receiving LYNPARZA and ADT had a 6% incidence of pulmonary embolism compared to 0.8% of patients treated with ADT plus either enzalutamide or abiraterone. Monitor patients for signs and symptoms of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, and treat as medically appropriate, which may include long-term anticoagulation as clinically indicated.Embryo-Fetal Toxicity: Based on its mechanism of action and findings in animals, LYNPARZA can cause fetal harm.

Select patients for therapy based on an FDA-approved companion diagnostic for LYNPARZA.Please see complete Prescribing Information, including Medication Guide.Financial considerationsUnder the oncology collaboration with AstraZeneca and following this new approval for LYNPARZA, AstraZeneca will receive a $105 million payment from Merck.About LYNPARZA® (olaparib)LYNPARZA is a first-in-class PARP inhibitor and the first targeted treatment to potentially exploit DNA damage response (DDR) pathway deficiencies, such as BRCA mutations, to preferentially kill cancer cells. Inhibition of PARP with LYNPARZA leads to the trapping of PARP bound to DNA single-strand breaks, stalling of replication forks, their collapse and the generation of DNA double-strand breaks and cancer cell death. LYNPARZA is being tested in a range of tumor types with defects and dependencies in the DDR.LYNPARZA, which is being jointly developed and commercialized by AstraZeneca and Merck, has a broad clinical trial development program, and AstraZeneca and Merck are working together to understand how it may affect multiple PARP-dependent tumors as a monotherapy and in combination across multiple cancer types.About metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancerProstate cancer is the second most common cancer in male patients globally and is associated with a significant mortality rate. Development of prostate cancer is often driven by male sex hormones called androgens, including testosterone. In patients with mCRPC, their prostate cancer grows and spreads to other parts of the body, despite the use of androgen-deprivation therapy to block the action of male sex hormones. Approximately 10-20% of patients with prostate cancer will develop CRPC within five years, with at least 84% of these patients presenting with metastases at the time of CRPC diagnosis. Of patients with no metastases at CRPC diagnosis, 33% are likely to develop metastases within two years.About the AstraZeneca and Merck strategic oncology collaborationIn July 2017, AstraZeneca and Merck, known as MSD outside of the United States and Canada, announced a global strategic oncology collaboration to co-develop and co-commercialize certain oncology products including LYNPARZA, the world’s first PARP inhibitor, for multiple cancer types. Working together, the companies will develop these products in combination with other potential new medicines and as monotherapies. Independently, the companies will develop these oncology products in combination with their respective PD-L1 and PD-1 medicines.Merck’s focus on cancerOur goal is to translate breakthrough science into innovative oncology medicines to help people with cancer worldwide.

(NYSE:MRK) insiders disposed of US$3.0m worth of stock",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-merck-co-110044660.html,1671620444,STORY,['MRK'],"[In the last year, many Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Merck The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At MerckOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP &amp; General Counsel, Jennifer Zachary, for US$1.7m worth of shares, at about US$99.85 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$110, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. We note that the biggest single sale was only 30% of Jennifer Zachary's holding.In the last year Merck insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Merck Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Merck shares. In total, insiders sold US$3.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesInsider OwnershipI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that Merck insiders own 0.06% of the company, worth about US$176m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At Merck Tell Us?Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. But since Merck is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. At Simply Wall St, we found 2 warning signs for Merck that deserve your attention before buying any shares.Of course Merck may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

This is because investors are concerned, following warnings from central banks, that interest rates are needed to be held at higher levels for a longer period. This has further induced choppiness in overall energy operations, which is reflected in the oil price chart.Companies belonging to the energy sector have been witnessing a choppy business environment since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The initial pandemic period, when there were no vaccines, saw an environment of heightened uncertainties. The commodity’s price plunged to a negative $36.98 per barrel on Apr 20, 2020. However, with the rapid developments of vaccines, which led to the gradual opening of the economies, the pricing scenario of West Texas Intermediate crude improved drastically over time to reach $123.64 per barrel on Mar 8, 2022. Oil price data are per the U.S. Energy Information Administration.Considering the backdrop, it would be wise for investors to bet on midstream stocks like DCP Midstream LP DCP and MPLX LP MPLX while keeping an eye onThe Williams Companies Inc WMB.Midstream Energy Players to the RescueAlthough the fate of energy players is highly dependent on oil and gas prices, stocks belonging to midstream space have lower exposure to volatility in commodity prices. This is because midstream players generate stable fee-based revenues since the transportation and storage assets are being booked by shippers for the long term. Thus, their business model is relatively low-risk, signifying considerably less exposure to both oil and gas price and volume risks.We have employed our Stock Screener to zero in on three stocks belonging to the midstream energy space. One stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), one carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and one has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continues3 Stocks in the SpotlightDCP Midstream LP: DCP Midstream is a leading provider of midstream services, having a fully integrated and resilient business model. With 12 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage assets, the master limited partnership has 2.8 billion cubic feet of daily natural gas pipeline capacity. DCP Midstream, with a Zacks Rank of 1, strongly focuses on strengthening its balance sheet with the foremost priority of reducing debt load.MPLX LP: MPLX has ownership and operating interests in midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, thereby generating stable cashflows. With a strong focus on returning capital to unit holders, the #2 Ranked MPLX announced that as of third-quarter 2022-end, it had roughly $1 billion available under its unit repurchase authorizations.The Williams Companies Inc: The Williams Companies is well-poised to capitalize on the mounting demand for clean energy since it is engaged in transporting, storing, gathering and processing natural gas and natural gas liquids.With its pipeline networks spread across more than 30,000 miles, The Williams Companies connects premium basins in the United States to the key market. With a Zacks Rank of 3 at present, WMB’s assets can meet 30% of the nation’s consumption of natural gas, which is utilized for heating purposes and clean energy generation.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy. Economic recovery for the aerospace and defense sector gained momentum in 2022 on the back of increasing demand for air travel. As per an outlook survey by Deloitte, 88% of senior executives noted that the business outlook for the aerospace and defense industry in 2023 is “somewhat to very positive.” The reasons for their optimism included developments in new technologies and segments like advanced air mobility, evolution of business models and greater exploration of space, and the use of digital thread and smart factories. According to Fitch Ratings, the Aerospace &amp; Defense outlook is improving, and feasible demand patterns should result in growing cash flows and deleveraging capacity starting in 2023. Fitch thinks commercial aircraft manufacturers and suppliers will be beneficiaries of robust global demand for new aircraft fleets as world travel recovers to pre-pandemic levels, despite the current recessionary threats looming ahead. Fitch sees deliveries of new large commercial aircrafts increasing by over 20% as compared to 2022, resulting in greater free cash flow and financial freedom for OEMs. Production rates should remain comparatively normal during the first half of next year, but could heighten towards the end of 2023. The aerospace industry is well positioned for long-term growth as the geopolitical environment remains unstable and defense capabilities around the world are being strengthened. Some of the best aerospace stocks to invest in include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX). Our Methodology We selected the following aerospace stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continues11 Best Aerospace Stocks To BuyJirat Teparaksa/Shutterstock.comBest Aerospace Stocks To Buy11. AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, and the company designs, develops, delivers, and supports robotic systems for government agencies and businesses in the United States and internationally. The company operates through four segments – Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Tactical Missile System, Medium Unmanned Aircraft Systems, and High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite Systems. On December 7, Canaccord analyst Austin Moeller raised the price target on AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) to $106 from $105 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst noted that Q3 revenues missed his estimates due to an unfeasible mix and an impact on gross margins from $4 million in amortization of intangibles but the company lifted its 2023 top-line guidance on the back of high demand for both the Puma Small UAS and the Switchblade 300 and 600 loitering munitions.According to Insider Monkey’s data, AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) was part of 18 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2022, up from 10 in the prior quarter. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 750,191 shares worth $62.5 million. Like Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) is one of the best aerospace stocks to invest in. 10. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) is a Colorado-based company that designs, manufactures, and services control solutions for the aerospace and industrial markets worldwide. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD)’s Aerospace segment provides fuel pumps, metering units, actuators, air valves, specialty valves, fuel nozzles, thrust reverser actuation systems, flight deck controls, actuators, servocontrols, motors, and sensors for aircrafts. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) is one of the best aerospace stocks to invest in. On November 17, Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.84 and a revenue of $640 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.10 and $13.45 million, respectively. The company expects total net sales for fiscal 2023 to be between $2.60 billion and $2.75 billion, versus a consensus of $2.37 billion. Aerospace sales growth percentage is forecasted to be between 14%-19%. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) expects earnings per share to be between $3.15 and $3.60. Truist analyst Michael Ciarmoli on November 18 raised the price target on Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) to $88 from $80 but kept a Hold rating on the shares. The company's Q3 revenue outperformed expectations and its FY23 guidance was better than consensus but high interest, incentive comp, weak industrial margins, and R&amp;D expense drove worse than anticipated earnings and free cash flow outlook, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 19 hedge funds were long Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD), compared to 18 funds in the earlier quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 4.3 million shares worth $348 million. Here is what Carillon Eagle Small Cap Growth Fund has to say about Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Woodward (NASDAQ:WWD) develops and produces control systems and energy conversion solutions and components for the aerospace and industrial end markets. The company’s stock was a strong performer in the quarter, as the end markets it serves began recovering in the second half of 2021 from a COVID-induced slowdown. Woodward’s relatively high exposure to narrow-body commercial jets should be a positive in the near-term, as narrow-body manufacturing, along with the demand for Woodward’s aftermarket components, is seeing a quicker recovery and is a growing share of the total fleet over their wide-body counterparts. Current energy and power demand is driving growth in power generation, as well as oil, gas, and alternative fuels, which has benefited the industrial side of the business.”9. Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) was founded in 1946 and is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. The company develops, manufactures, and markets structural materials for use in commercial aerospace, space and defense, and industrial markets. It operates through two segments, Composite Materials and Engineered Products. Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) expects EPS for full-year 2022 of $1.12-$1.24 versus the prior guidance of $1.00-$1.24, which is still in line with the $1.23 analyst consensus, but narrowed full-year revenue guidance to $1.53 billion-$1.6 billion from $1.50 billion-$1.63 billion previously. However, the new revenue guidance is still in line with the $1.59 billion consensus.BMO Capital analyst John McNulty on November 1 maintained a Market Perform rating on Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) and lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $61 from $66. The company's Q3 results were ""more modest than expected"", but its earnings recovery from the COVID-19 lows continues to improve, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 21 hedge funds were long Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL), compared to 25 funds in the prior quarter. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.05 million shares worth $54.5 million. Here is what LRT Capital Management has to say about Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Hexcel manufactures carbon fiber composite materials with the primary end markets being aerospace and defense. The company’s stock price was hit heavily last year due to the decline in the aerospace market, but the stock is making an impressive comeback this year as the outlook for travel and aerospace demand improves. The near-term demand for lightweight, high-performance carbon fiber composites is still uncertain, but the longer-term trend is clearly very strong. As airplane manufacturers look to improve the fuel efficiency and performance of their planes, the primary way of doing this is to reduce weight. The 787, 777X and A350 are just the most recent examples of planes from Boeing and Airbus that utilize an increasing amount of carbon fiber materials in their construction. Just as is the case with Marriott, we do not view recent results as meaningful or indicative of a long-term trend, but rather a once in a century aberration due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Once Covid-19 recedes, we expect the demand for more fuel-efficient planes to return rather quickly, powering the demand for the company’s light weight carbon composites.”8. Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) was founded in 1923 and is headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island. The company operates in the aircraft, defense, industrial, and finance businesses. Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)’s Aviation segment manufactures, sells, and services business jets, turboprop and piston engine aircrafts, military trainers, and defense aircrafts. It is one of the premier aerospace stocks to invest in. On December 5, Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu noted that the $80 billion future long-range assault aircraft program, awarded to Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)’s Bell V-280 by the U.S. Army, could be a ""$66 billion revenue generator through 2050"", adding $11 to Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) stock's net present value. The analyst also contended that its V-280 tilt rotor is a ""structurally better aircraft"" as the decision to award the contract to Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) came despite the ""very strong"" showing from Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky team.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 28 hedge funds were long Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 23 funds in the prior quarter. Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.18 million shares worth $185.7 million. 7. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is a Virginia-based aerospace and defense company. It runs through four segments – Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems, and Technologies. The Aerospace segment designs, manufactures, and sells business jets, offers aircraft maintenance and repair, charter, aircraft-on-ground support and completion, staffing, and fixed-base operator services. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is one of the leading aerospace stocks to invest in. On December 7, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) declared a $1.26 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on February 10, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 20. The dividend yield on December 20 came in at 2.06%. Citi analyst Jason Gursky initiated coverage of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) on December 8 with a Buy rating and a $298 price target. The growth outlook for the aerospace segment is optimistic, given recent order trends and a backlog level that provides earnings visibility for the next several years, the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 35 hedge funds were long General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) at the end of September 2022, compared to 42 funds in the prior quarter. James A. Star’s Longview Asset Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 30 million shares worth $6.3 billion. Here is what Oakmark Global Fund has to say about General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“The second new U.S. equity purchase was General Dynamics, a leading U.S. defense contractor and owner of the world’s premier business jet franchise (Gulfstream). We were able to purchase this high-quality and durable business at a meaningful discount to our estimate of its intrinsic value after a series of near-term concerns hurt its share price. Taking a longer term view, the company’s business jet franchise should benefit from a multi-year investment program in new, differentiated products. Also, its free cash flow conversion is set to improve materially and the company is poised to benefit from a highly visible ramp up in revenue related to next generation nuclear-powered submarines. As these positives come into clearer view, we expect sentiment to improve, along with the company’s share price.”6. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) was incorporated in 1916 and is based in Chicago, Illinois. The company designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and supports commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems, and related services worldwide. The company operates through four segments – Commercial Airplanes, Defense, Space &amp; Security, Global Services, and Boeing Capital. On December 16, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) received the biggest order for commercial aircraft in history as United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) agreed to buy 100 twin-aisle 787 Dreamliners, with an option to buy 100 more. The carrier also will buy 100 of Boeing’s 737 MAX single-aisle jets.Susquehanna analyst Charles Minervino raised the price target on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) on December 14 to $217 from $185 and kept a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst updated his model to factor in November's order and delivery data. He remains optimistic as high profile orders provide further evidence of a solid commercial aerospace demand outlook. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 42 hedge funds were bullish on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 51 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.5 million shares worth $178.5 million. In addition to Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), elite investors are piling into The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) for exposure to the aerospace industry. Meridian Funds made the following comment about The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favor The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) , a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Best Wine Stocks To Buy13 Best Materials Stocks To Buy11 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 11 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

167,60a9500f-b799-3f83-873b-18ec8ca7e9bc,MAA,2022-12-21,3 REITS That Just Increased Their Dividends,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reits-just-increased-dividends-162845384.html,1671553725,STORY,"['O', 'MAA-PI', 'BHR-PD']","[Most everyone loves an early holiday present. And for some real estate investment trust (REIT) investors, that early gift came in the form of a dividend increase over the past two weeks.Of course, a dividend increase is great because it puts more income into the pockets of investors and increases the yield on their purchase price, but more importantly, a dividend increase also signals to the markets that the company expects to perform well, perhaps generating increases in revenue and funds from operations (FFO) in the near future.Dividend increases also may have a beneficial effect on a REIT’s share price, especially if the increases are large or frequently occurring.Take a look at three diverse types of REITs that have rewarded shareholders by announcing dividend increases in the past two weeks:Realty Income Corp. (NYSE: O) is a San Diego-based REIT that owns and operates retail properties under long-term net lease contracts. Realty Income’s tenants are large, well-known companies like Walgreens Co., 7-Eleven Inc., CVS Pharmacy Inc., Lowe’s Cos. Inc., Dollar General Corp., FedEx Corp. and Walmart Inc. In total, it owns and operates over 11,700 properties across the U.S., the U.K and Spain.The “monthly dividend company,” as it calls itself, is a member of the S&amp;P 500 Dividend Aristocrats index that has declared 630 consecutive monthly stock dividends over 53 years and has increased its dividend 118 times since its initial public offering (IPO) in 1994. That’s a track record very few REITs come close to.On Dec. 13, Realty Income announced an increase to its monthly dividend from $0.248 to $0.2485. The ex-dividend date is Dec. 30, and the dividend will be paid on Jan. 1. The 52-week range is $55.50 to $75.40.While this latest hike may not seem like much, it should be noted that Realty Income has raised its dividend in small increments like this 14 times over the last five years, increasing the total dividend by 20.4%. The present dividend yield is 4.5%.Story continuesMid-America Apartment Communities Inc. (NYSE: MAA) is a Germantown, Tennessee-based residential REIT that specializes in purchasing and leasing apartment complexes. It owns over 101,000 units in 296 communities in 16 states and Washington, D.C. Most of Mid-America Apartment Communities’ properties are located in the Southeast, Southwest and Mid-Atlantic states. The 52-week range is $141.13 to $231.63, and the most recent closing share price was $155.31.On Dec. 13, Mid-America Apartment Communities raised its quarterly dividend by 12%, from $1.25 to $1.40 per share. The ex-dividend date is Jan. 12, and the dividend will be paid on Jan. 31. The present yield is 3.6%.Mid-America Apartment Communities has raised its dividend five times since 2017, for a total increase of 35.4%. That’s the gift that keeps on giving!Braemar Hotels &amp; Resorts (NYSE: BHR) is a Dallas-based REIT that invests in luxury hotels and resorts from California to Pennsylvania, and in Puerto Rico. Braemar Hotels &amp; Resorts direct hotel investments include 16 properties with a total of 4,181 rooms. The 52-week range is $3.41 to $6.64.On Dec. 8, Braemar Hotels &amp; Resorts announced a huge 400% quarterly dividend increase from $0.01 to $0.05. However, it should be noted that three years ago Braemar Hotels &amp; Resorts paid a quarterly dividend of $0.16 but then eliminated the dividend until March 2022, when it was reinstated at a penny per share.With this latest increase, the yield is now 5%. It also suggests that Braemar Hotels &amp; Resorts may be seeing improvements in its business after the COVID-19 pandemic decimated its revenue and earnings between 2020 and 2021.Watch: 'We're so early on in single-family rentals being an institutional asset class': Benzinga talk to The Peak Group about the rise in single-family rental investmentsWeekly REIT Report: REITs are one of the most misunderstood investment options, making it difficult for investors to spot incredible opportunities until it’s too late.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy. Economic recovery for the aerospace and defense sector gained momentum in 2022 on the back of increasing demand for air travel. As per an outlook survey by Deloitte, 88% of senior executives noted that the business outlook for the aerospace and defense industry in 2023 is “somewhat to very positive.” The reasons for their optimism included developments in new technologies and segments like advanced air mobility, evolution of business models and greater exploration of space, and the use of digital thread and smart factories. According to Fitch Ratings, the Aerospace &amp; Defense outlook is improving, and feasible demand patterns should result in growing cash flows and deleveraging capacity starting in 2023. Fitch thinks commercial aircraft manufacturers and suppliers will be beneficiaries of robust global demand for new aircraft fleets as world travel recovers to pre-pandemic levels, despite the current recessionary threats looming ahead. Fitch sees deliveries of new large commercial aircrafts increasing by over 20% as compared to 2022, resulting in greater free cash flow and financial freedom for OEMs. Production rates should remain comparatively normal during the first half of next year, but could heighten towards the end of 2023. The aerospace industry is well positioned for long-term growth as the geopolitical environment remains unstable and defense capabilities around the world are being strengthened. Some of the best aerospace stocks to invest in include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX). Our Methodology We selected the following aerospace stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continues11 Best Aerospace Stocks To BuyJirat Teparaksa/Shutterstock.comBest Aerospace Stocks To Buy11. AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, and the company designs, develops, delivers, and supports robotic systems for government agencies and businesses in the United States and internationally. The company operates through four segments – Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Tactical Missile System, Medium Unmanned Aircraft Systems, and High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite Systems. On December 7, Canaccord analyst Austin Moeller raised the price target on AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) to $106 from $105 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst noted that Q3 revenues missed his estimates due to an unfeasible mix and an impact on gross margins from $4 million in amortization of intangibles but the company lifted its 2023 top-line guidance on the back of high demand for both the Puma Small UAS and the Switchblade 300 and 600 loitering munitions.According to Insider Monkey’s data, AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) was part of 18 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2022, up from 10 in the prior quarter. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 750,191 shares worth $62.5 million. Like Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) is one of the best aerospace stocks to invest in. 10. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) is a Colorado-based company that designs, manufactures, and services control solutions for the aerospace and industrial markets worldwide. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD)’s Aerospace segment provides fuel pumps, metering units, actuators, air valves, specialty valves, fuel nozzles, thrust reverser actuation systems, flight deck controls, actuators, servocontrols, motors, and sensors for aircrafts. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) is one of the best aerospace stocks to invest in. On November 17, Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.84 and a revenue of $640 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.10 and $13.45 million, respectively. The company expects total net sales for fiscal 2023 to be between $2.60 billion and $2.75 billion, versus a consensus of $2.37 billion. Aerospace sales growth percentage is forecasted to be between 14%-19%. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) expects earnings per share to be between $3.15 and $3.60. Truist analyst Michael Ciarmoli on November 18 raised the price target on Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) to $88 from $80 but kept a Hold rating on the shares. The company's Q3 revenue outperformed expectations and its FY23 guidance was better than consensus but high interest, incentive comp, weak industrial margins, and R&amp;D expense drove worse than anticipated earnings and free cash flow outlook, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 19 hedge funds were long Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD), compared to 18 funds in the earlier quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 4.3 million shares worth $348 million. Here is what Carillon Eagle Small Cap Growth Fund has to say about Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Woodward (NASDAQ:WWD) develops and produces control systems and energy conversion solutions and components for the aerospace and industrial end markets. The company’s stock was a strong performer in the quarter, as the end markets it serves began recovering in the second half of 2021 from a COVID-induced slowdown. Woodward’s relatively high exposure to narrow-body commercial jets should be a positive in the near-term, as narrow-body manufacturing, along with the demand for Woodward’s aftermarket components, is seeing a quicker recovery and is a growing share of the total fleet over their wide-body counterparts. Current energy and power demand is driving growth in power generation, as well as oil, gas, and alternative fuels, which has benefited the industrial side of the business.”9. Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) was founded in 1946 and is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. The company develops, manufactures, and markets structural materials for use in commercial aerospace, space and defense, and industrial markets. It operates through two segments, Composite Materials and Engineered Products. Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) expects EPS for full-year 2022 of $1.12-$1.24 versus the prior guidance of $1.00-$1.24, which is still in line with the $1.23 analyst consensus, but narrowed full-year revenue guidance to $1.53 billion-$1.6 billion from $1.50 billion-$1.63 billion previously. However, the new revenue guidance is still in line with the $1.59 billion consensus.BMO Capital analyst John McNulty on November 1 maintained a Market Perform rating on Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) and lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $61 from $66. The company's Q3 results were ""more modest than expected"", but its earnings recovery from the COVID-19 lows continues to improve, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 21 hedge funds were long Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL), compared to 25 funds in the prior quarter. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.05 million shares worth $54.5 million. Here is what LRT Capital Management has to say about Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Hexcel manufactures carbon fiber composite materials with the primary end markets being aerospace and defense. The company’s stock price was hit heavily last year due to the decline in the aerospace market, but the stock is making an impressive comeback this year as the outlook for travel and aerospace demand improves. The near-term demand for lightweight, high-performance carbon fiber composites is still uncertain, but the longer-term trend is clearly very strong. As airplane manufacturers look to improve the fuel efficiency and performance of their planes, the primary way of doing this is to reduce weight. The 787, 777X and A350 are just the most recent examples of planes from Boeing and Airbus that utilize an increasing amount of carbon fiber materials in their construction. Just as is the case with Marriott, we do not view recent results as meaningful or indicative of a long-term trend, but rather a once in a century aberration due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Once Covid-19 recedes, we expect the demand for more fuel-efficient planes to return rather quickly, powering the demand for the company’s light weight carbon composites.”8. Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) was founded in 1923 and is headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island. The company operates in the aircraft, defense, industrial, and finance businesses. Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)’s Aviation segment manufactures, sells, and services business jets, turboprop and piston engine aircrafts, military trainers, and defense aircrafts. It is one of the premier aerospace stocks to invest in. On December 5, Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu noted that the $80 billion future long-range assault aircraft program, awarded to Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)’s Bell V-280 by the U.S. Army, could be a ""$66 billion revenue generator through 2050"", adding $11 to Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) stock's net present value. The analyst also contended that its V-280 tilt rotor is a ""structurally better aircraft"" as the decision to award the contract to Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) came despite the ""very strong"" showing from Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky team.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 28 hedge funds were long Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 23 funds in the prior quarter. Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.18 million shares worth $185.7 million. 7. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is a Virginia-based aerospace and defense company. It runs through four segments – Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems, and Technologies. The Aerospace segment designs, manufactures, and sells business jets, offers aircraft maintenance and repair, charter, aircraft-on-ground support and completion, staffing, and fixed-base operator services. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is one of the leading aerospace stocks to invest in. On December 7, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) declared a $1.26 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on February 10, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 20. The dividend yield on December 20 came in at 2.06%. Citi analyst Jason Gursky initiated coverage of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) on December 8 with a Buy rating and a $298 price target. The growth outlook for the aerospace segment is optimistic, given recent order trends and a backlog level that provides earnings visibility for the next several years, the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 35 hedge funds were long General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) at the end of September 2022, compared to 42 funds in the prior quarter. James A. Star’s Longview Asset Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 30 million shares worth $6.3 billion. Here is what Oakmark Global Fund has to say about General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“The second new U.S. equity purchase was General Dynamics, a leading U.S. defense contractor and owner of the world’s premier business jet franchise (Gulfstream). We were able to purchase this high-quality and durable business at a meaningful discount to our estimate of its intrinsic value after a series of near-term concerns hurt its share price. Taking a longer term view, the company’s business jet franchise should benefit from a multi-year investment program in new, differentiated products. Also, its free cash flow conversion is set to improve materially and the company is poised to benefit from a highly visible ramp up in revenue related to next generation nuclear-powered submarines. As these positives come into clearer view, we expect sentiment to improve, along with the company’s share price.”6. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) was incorporated in 1916 and is based in Chicago, Illinois. The company designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and supports commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems, and related services worldwide. The company operates through four segments – Commercial Airplanes, Defense, Space &amp; Security, Global Services, and Boeing Capital. On December 16, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) received the biggest order for commercial aircraft in history as United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) agreed to buy 100 twin-aisle 787 Dreamliners, with an option to buy 100 more. The carrier also will buy 100 of Boeing’s 737 MAX single-aisle jets.Susquehanna analyst Charles Minervino raised the price target on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) on December 14 to $217 from $185 and kept a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst updated his model to factor in November's order and delivery data. He remains optimistic as high profile orders provide further evidence of a solid commercial aerospace demand outlook. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 42 hedge funds were bullish on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 51 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.5 million shares worth $178.5 million. In addition to Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), elite investors are piling into The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) for exposure to the aerospace industry. Meridian Funds made the following comment about The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favor The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) , a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Best Wine Stocks To Buy13 Best Materials Stocks To Buy11 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 11 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The award has been provided by the Naval Air Systems Command, Patuxent River, MD.Details of the DealValued at $245.7 million, the contract is projected to be completed by December 2023. Per the terms of the deal, Lockheed will offer program management support, non-recurring engineering, F-35B/C laser shock peening, depot site support, contractor field and regional depot modification installations for supporting retrofit and modification efforts for the F-35 aircraft.The major part of work related to this deal will be carried out in Fort Worth, TX, Nagoya, Japan and Cameri, Italy. The deal will serve the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, Foreign Military Sales customers, and non-U.S. Department of Defense partners.Importance of F-35 for LMTLockheed Martin enjoys a dominant position in the global military aircraft space with its F-35 fleet. The stealth aircraft boasts features that make it an ideal choice for many nations. Moreover, LMT’s constant efforts to modernize and upgrade the aircraft with advanced technologies and enhance its capabilities to meet current warfare needs boost demand significantly.The F-35 program remained the largest revenue generator for its Aeronautics business unit and accounted for 68% of Aeronautics’ net sales in 2021.Lockheed Martin has delivered 841 F-35 airplanes since the program's inception, with 271 jets in backlog till September 2022. This, along with the latest contract win, boosts sales expectations for the Aeronautics business segment.Lockheed expects to make deliveries of this stealth aircraft in the range of 147-153 jets per year in 2023 and 2024, and 156 in 2025 and beyond. This, in turn, should bolster LMT’s revenues significantly from the military aircraft arena.Growth ProspectsPer Mordor Intelligence projections, the global military aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of more than 4% during 2022-2031. Such projections indicate immense opportunities for Lockheed Martin to further reap the benefits of military aircraft market expansion.Prominent defense majors that are involved in the manufacturing of military aircraft are Northrop Grumman NOC, Airbus Group EADSY and Textron TXT.Since its inception, Northrop Grumman has been a pioneer in the development of manned aircraft.

In contrast individual stocks will provide a wide range of possible returns, and may fall short. That's what happened in the case of Zions Bancorporation, National Association (NASDAQ:ZION): its share price dropped 26% while the market declined 21%. However, the longer term returns haven't been so bad, with the stock down 11% in the last three years. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 20% in the last three months.Given the past week has been tough on shareholders, let's investigate the fundamentals and see what we can learn. See our latest analysis for Zions Bancorporation National Association In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Unfortunately Zions Bancorporation National Association reported an EPS drop of 25% for the last year. This change in EPS is remarkably close to the 26% decrease in the share price. So it seems that the market sentiment has not changed much, despite the weak results. Rather, the share price is remains a similar multiple of the EPS, suggesting the outlook remains the same.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthIt's probably worth noting we've seen significant insider buying in the last quarter, which we consider a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. Dive deeper into the earnings by checking this interactive graph of Zions Bancorporation National Association's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Zions Bancorporation National Association the TSR over the last 1 year was -24%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 21% in the twelve months, Zions Bancorporation National Association shareholders did even worse, losing 24% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 0.6%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

(NYSE: PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has accepted for review a New Drug Application (NDA) for etrasimod for individuals living with moderately-to-severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). The FDA’s decision is expected in the second half of 2023. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also accepted the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for etrasimod in the same patient population with the decision anticipated in the first half of 2024.Etrasimod is an oral, once daily, selective sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor modulator designed for optimized pharmacology and engagement of S1P receptors 1, 4, and 5. In addition to UC, it is being investigated for a range of other immuno-inflammatory diseases.UC is a chronic and often debilitating condition1 that affects an estimated 3.8 million people in North America and Europe.2 Symptoms of UC can include chronic diarrhea with blood and mucus, abdominal pain, and urgency.3,4 UC can have a significant effect on work, family, and social activities. There is a need for additional advanced therapeutic options in UC that are oral, effective, and have a favorable risk-benefit profile.""Ulcerative colitis can substantially impact the day-to-day lives of people living with this chronic and often debilitating disease, and many patients never achieve nor maintain remission on today’s therapies,"" said Michael Corbo, PhD, Chief Development Officer, Inflammation &amp; Immunology, Pfizer Global Product Development. ""We believe that etrasimod, if approved, has the potential to be a best-in-class, first-line advanced therapy for people living with moderately-to-severely active ulcerative colitis, based on its clinical profile.""Story continuesThese submissions were based on previously announced results from the ELEVATE UC Phase 3 registrational program (ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12) that evaluated the safety and efficacy of etrasimod 2 mg once daily on clinical remission in UC patients who had previously failed or were intolerant to at least one conventional, biologic, or Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor therapy. Both randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies achieved all primary and key secondary endpoints, with a safety profile consistent with previous studies.About ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12 are pivotal trials that are part of the ELEVATE UC Phase 3 registrational program.5ELEVATE UC 52 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that utilized a treat-through design comprising of a 12-week induction period followed by a 40-week maintenance period. Beginning at week 12, all patients could continue their randomized treatment; patients whose disease had not improved or had worsened compared to baseline could discontinue and, if eligible, enroll in an open-label extension study. The primary objective of this trial was to assess the safety and efficacy of etrasimod 2 mg once daily on clinical remission after both 12 and 52 weeks. The primary endpoint is based on the 3-domain, modified Mayo score (MMS). In ELEVATE UC 52, clinical remission was 27.0% for patients receiving etrasimod compared to 7.4% for patients receiving placebo at week 12 (19.8% differential, P≤.001) and was 32.1% compared to 6.7% at week 52 (25.4% differential, P≤.001). Statistically significant improvements were attained in all key secondary endpoints, including endoscopic improvement, symptomatic remission, and mucosal healing at weeks 12 and 52, and corticosteroid-free remission and sustained clinical remission at week 52.ELEVATE UC 12 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial to assess the efficacy and safety of etrasimod 2 mg once-daily in subjects with moderately-to-severely active UC. The primary objective of this trial was to assess the safety and efficacy of etrasimod on clinical remission at 12 weeks assessed by the FDA-required, 3-domain, MMS. In ELEVATE UC 12, clinical remission was achieved among 24.8% of patients receiving etrasimod compared to 15.2% of patients receiving placebo (9.7% differential, P=.0264). All key secondary endpoints were met at week 12, including endoscopic improvement, symptomatic remission, and mucosal healing.In ELEVATE UC 12, a similar proportion of patients experienced treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs) between etrasimod 2 mg and placebo treatment groups, while in ELEVATE UC 52, it was higher in the etrasimod 2 mg group compared to placebo. The proportion of patients experiencing serious AEs was similar between treatment groups in both trials. The most common treatment-emergent AEs in 3% or more of etrasimod-treated patients and greater than placebo up to week 52 in either trial were headache, worsening of UC, COVID-19 infection, dizziness, pyrexia, arthralgia, abdominal pain and nausea. There were no reports of bradycardia or atrioventricular block as serious AEs. Data support initiation of etrasimod treatment does not require complex up-titration regimen.Nearly two-thirds of patients in ELEVATE UC 52 and ELEVATE UC 12, respectively, were naïve to biologic or JAK inhibitor therapy.Pfizer Inc.: Breakthroughs that Change Patients’ LivesAt Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to bring therapies to people that extend and significantly improve their lives.

The bivalent booster shot, in particular, targets the original strain of the coronavirus as well as the Omicron variant, which is able to evade earlier versions of the vaccine.Despite the high number of COVID cases in the U.S. over the past month, only a fraction have resulted in hospitalization, according to the latest CDC data. The current seven-day average for hospitalization is 5,010, a 2.3% week-over-week increase.“I got both [the bivalent booster and flu shot] at the same time,” Sun said. “And now I’m doing great. That was two months ago. And I haven’t gotten sick, even though I’m constantly exposed to people who are sick and have symptoms. I haven’t gotten it yet. And if I were, I know that the severity would be lessened to the point where I don’t have to worry I’ll end up in the hospital.”This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.'That's on your conscience'Despite early progress, vaccine and booster uptake has slowed in recent weeks.So far, 68.9% of the U.S. population — and 78.7% of those over the age of 18 — have completed a “primary series” of COVID vaccines, meaning they either received a single dose of the Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) vaccine or were double vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine such as those from Pfizer (PFE), Novavax (NVAX), and Moderna (MRNA).Story continuesYet just 14.1% of the population (and 16.3% of those 18+) have gotten the updated bivalent booster shot.“Obviously we live in a country where if you’re being told what to do, you may get a backlash and a worse outcome when people — out of defiance or pride or fear — do the opposite of what you would recommend,” Sun said.Sun explained that he takes a different approach to convey the importance of vaccines.“No one’s forcing you or looking over your shoulder or arresting you or doing whatever that you’re afraid they might be doing to you if you don’t do something,” he said. “It’s just on your conscience.”But, he added, “there are consequences. And if Grandma gets sick and dies because you got her sick — because you refused to mask around her out of pride or fear or whatever it is or you decide not to get vaccinated when you visit your family and get Grandpa sick, and they’re in the hospital later on — those are vulnerable populations. That’s on your conscience.”A nurse prepares a Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine for Jose Luis Sanchez at a clinic on August 19, 2021 at Tournament House in Pasadena, California. (Photo by Robyn Beck / AFP)Vulnerable populations include the elderly, the very young, and those who are immunocompromised. Nearly 94% of those ages 65 and up have been fully vaccinated while 35.7% have received the bivalent booster dose.“You have to accept those consequences because you didn’t do something that you could have,” Sun said. “If you decide not to put on a seatbelt, there are consequences when bad things happen, and you have to own that consequence. When people hear it is this way, they do consider it a little more seriously. And that tips the needle a little bit. It does make a huge difference.”Maintaining a low hospitalization rate is key to containing the spread of the virus, Sun added. In the early days of the pandemic, most hospitals were extremely overwhelmed and lacked the capacity to meet demand.“We don’t want it to collapse because once we run out of beds, where are people going to go?” Sun said. “People are concerned because the vaccine doesn’t prevent all illness. Well, seatbelts don’t prevent all car accidents. Bulletproof vests don’t prevent getting shot. Helmets don’t prevent a brick falling on your head but do reduce the chances that you’re going to end up in a hospital and take up an otherwise necessary bed.”—Adriana Belmonte is a reporter and editor covering politics and health care policy for Yahoo Finance.

That compares with its previous assessment of $3,600 to $5,800 per course.ICER is not a government agency and has no authority to set prices. But many large health insurers take their reports into account when they negotiate prices with drug manufacturers and determine patient access. Drugmakers also take into account ICER estimates when they set prices for new medicines.Pfizer will need to negotiate prices with private payers like insurers for the two-drug oral treatment when inventory built up by the U.S. government runs out and many COVID care costs revert to the private insurance market.""With new negotiations underway on pricing and payment between commercial insurers and the manufacturer, we believe it will be helpful for all stakeholders to have updated calculations of a price that aligns with the evidence on benefits to patients,"" said ICER president Steven Pearson.The United States has bought nearly 24 million Paxlovid courses from Pfizer at around $530 a course.The drugmaker has not yet suggested what the price will be when it moves to a commercial market. Pfizer expects to roughly quadruple the price of its COVID-19 vaccine after the United States government's current purchase program expires.""Given the clinical and economic burden of COVID-19, we continue to believe Paxlovid offers strong value to patients, physicians, and payers,"" Pfizer spokesperson Kit Longley said in an email, adding that the company was reviewing ICER's latest assessment.ICER said it considered evidence suggesting lower hospitalization rates in untreated patients, lower than previous relative reduction in hospitalization with Paxlovid and broader immunity to COVID-19 in the United States in setting the new suggested price range.

Pfizer will now lead all development and commercialization activities related to sisunatovir in Greater ChinaIn return for Pfizer exercising this option, LianBio will receive an upfront payment of $20 million, which will be released from previously restricted cash paid by Pfizer. In addition, LianBio will be eligible to receive up to $135 million in potential milestone payments and tiered low-single-digit royalties on future net product sales in Great China if the candidate is approved in the territories.Earlier this June, Pfizer acquired privately held ReViral for a total consideration of up to $525 million, including potential milestone payments. The acquisition led to the addition of Reviral’s sisunatovir in Pfizer’s pipeline, which is being evaluated in mid-stage studies for treating RSV infections in adults and infants. The rights for developing and marketing the drug in Greater China were out-licensed to LianBio in March 2021 and were not included in the acquisition deal.As a result of Pfizer exercising this right, LianBio will also be released from its obligations to pay any milestone or royalty payments on sisunatovir’s pipeline progress and future net product sales.Shares of LianBio have plunged 72.9% in the year compared with the industry’s 19.7% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchPfizer is evaluating sisunatovir in a global phase II study in children.

(PFE): Here is What You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-pfizer-inc-140002385.html,1671544802,STORY,['PFE'],"[Pfizer (PFE) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this drugmaker have returned +6.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's -3.6% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Pfizer belongs, has gained 4.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Pfizer is expected to post earnings of $1.09 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.2%.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.46 points to a change of +46.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.82 indicates a change of -25.4% from what Pfizer is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.6%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Pfizer is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PFE _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Pfizer, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $24.13 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $100.17 billion and $77.2 billion estimates indicate +22.9% and -22.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPfizer reported revenues of $22.64 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -6%. EPS of $1.78 for the same period compares with $1.34 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $21.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +7.61%. The EPS surprise was +21.09%.Over the last four quarters, Pfizer surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Pfizer is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Pfizer. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

He’s said he plans to emphasize Twitter’s engineering as owner, and it’s hard to tell what’s left of other operations, such as legal and finance after the departures.The billionaire executive embarked on a search for a new CEO, according to a person familiar with the search, after losing a straw poll he posted on the social media site that asked whether he should relinquish his role as head of the company.Musk’s Twitter Legal Woes Widen With FTC Probe, Police QuestionsMore than 10 million votes, or 57.5%, were in favor of Musk stepping down, according to results that came in Monday morning. Musk committed to abide by the results when he launched the survey, but a day later he had tweeted more than a dozen times without directly addressing the outcome. The search for a new CEO could be drawn out and take time to yield results, said the person, who asked for anonymity discussing a private matter.Musk has been almost single-handedly running Twitter since he bought it in October for $44 billion. He said early on that he didn’t plan to stay permanently as CEO and he has surrounded himself with a few trusted people, some of whom have suggested they’d be ready to take on what Musk calls a thankless task. “No one wants the job who can actually keep Twitter alive. There is no successor,” Musk tweeted earlier this week.Story continuesMusk also said during a Twitter Spaces hosted late Tuesday that the platform was on course to hit $3 billion of negative cash flow, prior to the recent round of severe cost-cutting.Among those who have remained in Musk’s inner circle are Jason Calacanis, an investor and podcaster, and former PayPal Holdings Inc. exec David Sacks. The two were part of Musk’s war room in the days after the deal closed and people familiar with the situation said they were given internal accounts and helped make decisions about who would keep their jobs. Both have been making public suggestions for Twitter’s business strategy.Calacanis kept his ideas for monetizing Twitter coming, advocating on Tuesday for features including a “poll analytics” link where information on Twitter poll results would be broken down by voter attribute, such as country and number of Twitter followers. Such insights are “well worth paying for,” he tweeted. On Monday, he talked up Twitter’s new business branding efforts.Read about some of the potential candidates for Twitter CEO jobSacks also retweeted a notification about Twitter Business on Monday, a new program that lets businesses identify their brands and key employees on Twitter. Sacks added the logo for Craft Ventures, the venture firm he runs, to the side of his name. In a reference to Musk’s poll about whether he should stay on as Twitter’s CEO, Sacks suggested that other CEOs run the same type of poll.In one of his first tweets after the closing of the survey, Musk said Twitter will restrict voting on major policy decisions to paying Twitter Blue subscribers. The service, which costs $8 a month, had attracted about 140,000 subscribers as of Nov. 15, the New York Times has reported.Calacanis didn’t respond to an emailed request about whether he and Musk had discussed the CEO role. A spokeswoman for Sacks declined to comment.CNBC’s David Faber reported earlier on Musk’s search for a new CEO. Faber reported that Musk’s search has been ongoing and started before the Twitter poll emerged.Musk’s dramatic stunt, asking the public about his leadership capabilities, came shortly after he attended the World Cup final match in Qatar, triggering a wave of trending topics such as “VOTE YES” and “CEO of Twitter.”Musk has warned that Twitter is at risk of bankruptcy and instituted a “hardcore” work environment for the remaining workers after a drastic cutback in staff. In his less than two months at the helm, he has spooked advertisers, alienated Twitter’s most ardent creators and turned the service from a reflection of the news of the day into the main topic.After losing the initial poll, Musk, who’s also CEO of Tesla Inc., retweeted promotional material for the car company and for Twitter’s Blue for Business service. He also responded to an article about rival Toyota Motor Corp.’s criticism of electric vehicles with a simple “Wow.”The stock of Tesla, by far Musk’s most valuable holding, has plummeted since the Twitter acquisition and critics have argued he’s spending too much time on the social media company.

This has lagged the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 5.51% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.6% in that time.Paypal will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. On that day, Paypal is projected to report earnings of $1.19 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 7.21%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $7.39 billion, up 6.76% from the year-ago period.For the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $4.08 per share and revenue of $27.52 billion, which would represent changes of -11.3% and +8.47%, respectively, from the prior year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Paypal. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Research indicates that these estimate revisions are directly correlated with near-term share price momentum. To benefit from this, we have developed the Zacks Rank, a proprietary model which takes these estimate changes into account and provides an actionable rating system.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

You can skip our outlook of the equity market and go directly to the 5 Best Stocks To Invest In Right Now.The equities markets around the world have been in a slump in 2022 over concerns of an impending recession and rising interest rates. The S&amp;P 500 index is down 20% YTD, reflecting the challenging environment both companies and investors had to face in 2022. The current market environment is difficult for individual investors who favor stock-picking as picking and choosing a stock in this market is extremely difficult as the market heads south. This is where the benefits of having your funds invested with a hedge fund or following the positions of large successful hedge funds can reap the rewards for investors.As the name suggests, hedge funds are “hedged” against several risks, which an individual investor might not consider or remain oblivious to. Most hedge funds perform better in bear markets than in bull markets. Hedge funds employ different strategies to protect the value of the assets under management and provide returns to investors. One of the most popular kinds of hedge funds across the globe is the long-short equity fund. The total asset size of long-short equity funds in the world is estimated to be $683 billion. However, investors have been taking money out of these long-short equity funds over the past few years. In 2022 till August, $25 billion have been taken out by investors from long-short equity funds.Funds that employ various strategies across different asset classes, often called “multi-strategy funds,” are gaining popularity around the world. The difference in asset-under-management of long-short equity funds and multi-strategy funds has come down to approximately $27 billion from $235 billion in 2021. Multi-strategy funds can improve investors' access to new investment methods, reducing the need for time-consuming due diligence. Similarly, employing a single strategy, especially during periods of high volatility, is not wise, which is why multi-strategy hedge funds are gaining popularity.Story continuesWhy Hedge Funds Win and Why Should We Pay Attention to Their Stock Picks?A latest report by Bloomberg cements the argument which says that major hedge funds have an edge in the market over average investors due to the sheer scale of the money, resources and talent these institutions have. The report says that despite the economic volatility, giants in the $4 trillion hedge fund industry were able to post double-digit gains. These notable names include Citadel and Millennium Management.Bloomberg specifically mentioned the role resources play in this performance:""Giants from Citadel to Millennium Management produced double-digit gains as their army of traders once again earned steady returns.""The report also noted that a whopping 95% of the capital allocated to multi-strategy investment firms posted gains in 2022 through September, while nine in every 10 dollars invested in macro hedge funds gained 23.7% on average in the same period. Hedge funds on average lost 9% in this period, while the S&amp;P index fell 25%.Given this outperformance, in this article, we will focus on the top picks of over 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. These stocks are the most popular among the elite hedge funds, as of the end of the third quarter.Best Stocks To Invest In Right Now According to Hedge Funds12. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 115Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is a streaming video-on-demand platform that provides original and third-party digital video content to consumers. It is the largest subscription-based SVOD platform, with over 220 million subscribers.On December 9, 2022, John Blackledge, an analyst at Cowen, increased his price target on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) to $405 while keeping an Outperform rating on the stock. The analyst named the company as his top large-cap pick for 2023.As per Insider Monkey’s database, 115 hedge funds remained bullish on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) at the end of the third quarter. Fisher Asset Management had the biggest stake in the company at the end of the third quarter.Harding Loevner, an asset management company, mentioned Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) mustered a modest recovery as the market Allocation Effect: 0.3 mulled the potential of its new lower-priced ad-supported subscription model to drive revenue growth and reduce its dependency on continued heavy investment in content to attract and retain viewers.11. salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 117Founded in 1999, salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a cloud-based company that provides software solutions focused on customer relationship management, customer services, sales, application development, marketing automation, and analytics.On December 5, 2022, Phil Winslow, an analyst at Credit Suisse, reduced his price target on salesforce.com, inc.

According to the analyst, the company’s Q3 results were impressive, and the management raised its 2023 operating margin guidance to 20.7% from prior guidance of 20.4%, which is a positive sign.According to Insider Monkey’s database, 117 hedge funds held shares of the company at the end of the third quarter of 2022. Fisher Asset Management was the most bullish fund on the company’s stock at the end of Q3 2022.Aristotle Atlantic Partners, LLC, an investment advisor, mentioned salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its third-quarter 2022 investor letter. Here’s what the firm said:We sold Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) to reduce our weighting in the Information Technology sector. Salesforce held their investor day, and the company reiterated their organic Fiscal Year 2026 revenue target of $50 billion. This target remains more back-end loaded based on current slowing macroeconomic conditions and requires new annual contract growth well ahead of what the company has been averaging for the past few years. We are skeptical that the company will be able to achieve this revenue target organically and see Merger &amp; Acquisitions (M&amp;A) being key to achieving the growth. While we believe Salesforce has shown good success in growing its non-CRM clouds, we do see more competitive pressures emerging for the Marketing and Customer Service Clouds, specifically on the pricing side during a global economic slowdown.10.

(NASDAQ:AAPL) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a leading technology provider in telecommunications. computing and services. Apple’s iOS operating system is the company’s unique intellectual property and competitive strength. This software drives extremely tight engagement with consumers and enterprises. The engagement is fostering the growing purchase of high-margin services like music, apps, and apple pay. Apple’s shares detracted from performance as management lowered its guidance for the second quarter due to headwinds from the war in Ukraine, adverse foreign currency shifts, and dampened consumer demand associated with the coronavirus in China. Additionally, many investors were concerned that lockdowns implemented to curtail the spread of COVID-19 would impact the production of apple products, however, the manufacturing facilities have resumed activity.8. Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 142Headquartered in San Francisco, California, Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) is a company that offers mobility as a service. The services offered by the company include ride-hailing, food, package delivery, couriers, etc. The company runs its operations in more than 63 countries and has over 110 million users. Almost 70% of the total revenue is generated through ride-sharing, while 20% comes from food delivery.The company’s Q3 revenue amounted to $8.34 billion, beating market expectations by $284.22 million. The company’s Normalized EPS stood at $0.21, missing market expectations by $0.27.

In July, we initiated our position in Uber, a leader in global ride-hailing and online food delivery. We believe the company is well positioned to benefit from strong secular tailwinds in both of its core businesses. Earlier this year, management outlined a plan at its investor day to achieve $4 billion of free cash flow by 2024, an encouraging commitment given investors have maligned the company for years of being unprofitable. We witnessed solid progress toward achieving this goal in the company’s most recent earnings results, where it beat expectations for the quarter on both fronts and delivered positive FCF for the first time. The company also indicated it isn’t seeing any evidence of slowing demand. We recognize the execution risk associated with Uber achieving its long-term targets, and the path likely won’t be linear, which is why we are keeping our position size modest until we see signs of continued operational momentum in the coming quarters.7.

202,fe949603-d0cd-33a4-8ace-8241ed5de142,PYPL,2022-12-21,3 Stocks to Gain Big if Cryptocurrency Rebounds,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-gain-big-cryptocurrency-135101872.html,1671544261,STORY,['PYPL'],"[The blockchain-powered cryptocurrency market, which once gained momentum, has been witnessing a topsy-turvy situation since the beginning of 2022. The market is flashing red, with most digital currencies plummeting, including bitcoin (BTC) and ethereum (ETH), the most popular ones.According to data from Trading View, total crypto market capitalization plummeted to $781 billion at the beginning of November 2022, which marked the lowest point since December 2020. The crypto market continued to be volatile and reached a market capitalization of around $764.9 billion at the end of Dec 19. Furthermore, BTC and ETH closed at $16,439.68 and $1,167.61 on Dec 19, plunging almost 14% and 9.2% in the last two months, respectively.The current downfall in the crypto market is primarily attributed to the massive decline in the major indexes of the U.S. equity market, which has been suffering from the Federal Reserve’s aggressive stance on cutting down the inflation rate through continuous interest rate hike. In 2022, the Fed spiked interest rates by 75 basis points four times and by 50 basis points at its recent Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The Fed will continue to hike interest rates in order to drag down inflation to its target of 2% at best by 2025.The latest crash of the crypto exchange, FTX, also remains another big reason behind the downturn in the crypto market. Due to a lack of liquidity and mismanagement of funds, FTX filed for Chapter 11 last month. This has been taking a toll on BTC, ETH and other digital currencies.Upside Potential in the Crypto SpaceDespite these macro headwinds, the crypto market holds huge upside potential. Per a report by Grand View Research, the global cryptocurrency market is expected to witness a CAGR of 12.2% between 2022 and 2030.Digital and contactless trading and payments via cryptocurrencies are expected to gain further momentum.Further, the great hedging opportunities that digital currencies, especially bitcoins, offer to investors against inflation are expected to continue bolstering their adoption rate as well as drive growth in the cryptocurrency market.Additionally, blockchain technology minimizes the risks of monetary losses, double counting and hacking as it leverages a distributed consensus that makes tampering with the records very difficult. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies are eventually becoming mainstream in the process of peer-to-peer payments, payments for Web3 applications and remittance transactions, among others.Also, the growing demand for alternative currency as a result of the ongoing pandemic remains a tailwind. Many companies worldwide are now adopting the idea of cryptocurrencies as payment options and increasing their bitcoin holdings.Considering these growth factors, the cryptocurrency market is expected to rebound strongly once the impact of the abovementioned headwinds subsides.Against this backdrop, here we focus on three stocks namely PayPal PYPL, Block SQ and Marathon Digital MARA, which have wide exposure to the said market. These stocks have the potential to outshine once the market bounces back.PayPal: It is one of the well-known bitcoin-related stocks that should be focused on. Notably, this leader in digital payment processes helps merchants to accept crypto payments. It offers a service that allows its customers to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency directly from their PayPal account. Additionally, it provides a feature called Crypto on Venmo, which lets Venmo customers buy, hold and sell cryptocurrency directly within the Venmo app. Customers can also check cryptocurrency trends from the app. It also offers a feature called Checkout with Crypto, which lets customers convert their cryptocurrency holdings seamlessly into fiat currency at the time of checkout.These apart, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s acquisition of digital asset security technology provider — Curv — remains noteworthy. Further, PayPal’s strong efforts toward expanding its footprint in the global crypto space are encouraging. It offers cryptocurrency service in the United Kingdom, which allows users to buy, hold and sell digital currencies like bitcoin, bitcoin cash, ethereum or Litecoin directly from their PayPal account.Additionally, the company’s recent partnership with ConsenSys is another positive. Per the terms, PayPal has been added as an option for a cryptocurrency transaction to ConsenSys’ digital cryptocurrency wallet – MetaMask, with the help of which the latter’s users are now able to buy and transfer Ether seamlessly by logging into their PayPal accounts.Story continuesPayPal Holdings, Inc. Price and ConsensusPayPal Holdings, Inc. Price and ConsensusPayPal Holdings, Inc. price-consensus-chart | PayPal Holdings, Inc. QuoteBlock: It is a well-known player in the cryptocurrency market with its wide offerings associated with bitcoin transactions. The company derives the majority of its revenues from bitcoin transactions. In third-quarter 2022, bitcoin revenues accounted for 39% of the total revenues.Notably, this Zacks Rank #3 company facilitates the buying and selling of bitcoins via its Cash App. Further, Block intends to develop a bitcoin mining system in a bid to bolster its presence in the cryptocurrency market. The company strives to carry out the process of mining, maintaining, setting up and purchasing bitcoin efficiently with its bitcoin mining system. The company has already hired veterans in crypto mining engineering as well as a manager to carry out the project of its mining unit.Its recent investment in an Africa-based renewable bitcoin miner namely Gridless remains noteworthy. We note that Block along with Stillmark led a $2 million seed funding round in Gridless.Block, Inc. Price and ConsensusBlock, Inc. Price and ConsensusBlock, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Block, Inc. QuoteMarathon Digital: It is one of the largest enterprise bitcoin self-mining companies in North America. It is benefiting from the increasing deployment of miners, growing production of bitcoins, robust bitcoin holdings and a hike in its hash rate.

Both are here with us now to share their impressions. Pras, I'll go to you first here. Does this thing impress you? It better impress you because, well over $100,000, right?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yes, for sure. It's the first edition model, well over $100,000. You know, and I was originally kind of scared to pick this thing up because it was s-- it's supposedly so huge. And, you know, I got to drive from the city, meet up with Rick that day.

So, I mean, I would never in a million years pay $100,000 for this. But I love that General Motors is building it because the engineers get to tuck all these things in there that they've been dreaming about for years, like the CrabWalk feature.- Mm. Pras can tell you more about the details of that. But, I mean, let's just go back to what the Hummer is. So General Motors started making the Hummer-- they licensed the name from AM General when Arnold Schwarzenegger bought an original military Hummer. So then they sold the Hummer H1. What most people saw as a Hummer was a Hummer H2, which was this gigantic beast built on a GM pickup truck frame.Story continuesAnd if-- you were lucky if you got 10 miles to the gallon on that.- Right.RICK NEWMAN: So when gas hit 4 bucks a gallon in 2008 and then GM declared bankruptcy in 2009, that was the end of the Hummer. And they actually tried to sell the brand to a Chinese company in bankruptcy. And that deal fell through. So it's almost by luck that GM even still has this brand. And I love the fact that they're bringing it back as an all-electric. Because--- Was it moving sideways in one of those--PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: That was the Cra--RICK NEWMAN: CrabWalk.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: --that was a CrabWalk. It can turn the tires all one direction and go like this, and go like this, and go like this. It's like a--RICK NEWMAN: Now, why would you want to do that?- Cause you could.[LAUGHTER]- So you don't have to get the keys from somebody else who's at their house--RICK NEWMAN: It has something to do with off-road driving that no one's ever gonna do.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: I actually was sneaking into a parallel spot. And I put in CrabWalk and just went woop.- But, guys, guys-- oh, sorry, go ahead, Brad.- Well, I was just gonna briefly ask you, because, I mean, it was great to see you guys in the shot of reporters and cars getting coffee. But at the end of the day, it still does come down to, how far is this thing gonna go? What is the charge versus the previous Hummers that were gas guzzlers?PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So this car can get 340 miles per--- Wow.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: --charge. It's got a massive, massive battery. This thing weighs almost 10,000 pounds. I want to quickly say that, you know, Brad, yeah, it is pretty capable. I mean, you're paying a big price, not very efficient from a watts per mile point of view. But I got to say, one point I'll make is that this is basically what the Cybertruck should've been. And GM has made it, right? ?- Yeah.- This thing is big, badass, and it's, like, super capable.- OK, so--PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: So that's what it is.- --who's buying this thing?- And we--- That's my question because the original-- the market for the original Hummer was you would buy one of these things because you wanted to be super obnoxious. It was sort of implicit in buying these, you were gonna be the jerk on the road with this thing burning lots of gas, big hulking machine. So who's gonna--RICK NEWMAN: That's the New Yorker view of the Hummer.- It'sRICK NEWMAN: There's also a Texas view of the Hummer, which is kind of the opposite. But-- so the H2--- That you're modest and you want to you know, meekly go along the road? No.RICK NEWMAN: Love-hate car designs always succeed. Because when people hate it, that makes the people who love it love it even more. But this is why this is a smart move for GM. Now you can buy this beast and it's environmental because it's electric. It's probably not that environmental. Because, I mean, you're still suck--- Well, those big tires, too, they're green.RICK NEWMAN: --see, you're still burning fossil fuels to generate the electricity that goes into the car.- Ah.RICK NEWMAN: But It's not getting 10 miles to the gallon anymore.- Yeah. I mean, it's, like, it's-- I don't want to say virtue signaling, but--RICK NEWMAN: Oh, it totally is.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: --but it's a-- and you're like--- But you'll say that. That's Rick will see it.- --hey, I can be badass and I can still be, you know, sort of-- my carbon footprint is neutralized.- Mm, OK.PRAS SUBRAMANIAN: You know what I mean?- OK, all right. Well, we'll see. We'll see who actually buys this thing.RICK NEWMAN: They're gonna sell every one of these they make.- OK.RICK NEWMAN: There are plenty of rich bros who want this in their driveway right now.]"

I will abide by the results of this poll,"" Musk tweeted to his 122.1 million followers on Sunday.The poll closed on Monday morning, with 57.5% of the 17.5 million votes choosing ""Yes.""Musk hasn't disclosed whether he would in fact step down.Shares of Tesla finished Monday's session down slightly, mirroring the broader market.""You need a CEO of Twitter that's not Musk,"" Ives said on Yahoo Finance Live on Friday. ""This is what I'd say is an untenable situation in terms of him being CEO of Twitter and Tesla.""Shares of the EV maker are down about 63% from a peak last November — the stock's largest drawdown since its market debut in 2010 — and down 23% so far this month alone.Story continuesMost of the losses for Tesla investors began following Musk's April offer to buy Twitter, a deal that closed in in late October.Brian Sozzi is an editor-at-large and anchor at Yahoo Finance.

207,99e35726-713f-34c0-9e4c-46e0701e43b0,MKC,2022-12-21,McCormick (MKC) Benefits From Acquisitions & Cost Savings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mccormick-mkc-benefits-acquisitions-cost-151703257.html,1671549423,STORY,"['MKC', 'MKC-V', 'KHC', 'TSN', 'HRL']","[McCormick &amp; Company MKC is increasing its presence through acquisitions to enhance its portfolio. The global leader in flavors is capitalizing on a sustained shift to cooking more at home, higher digital engagement, clean and flavorful eating and trusted brands. Its effective cost-saving plans are yielding amid rising inflationary pressure.Let’s delve deeper.Prudent Acquisitions Driving GrowthThe Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company has been undertaking strategic acquisitions to drive growth. The company bought a 100% stake in FONA International, LLC and some of its affiliates. FONA’s diverse portfolio helps McCormick bolster its value-add offerings and expand the flavor solutions segment into attractive categories. In November 2020, McCormick completed the acquisition of the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce — a premium Mexico-based hot sauce brand. McCormick believes that the buyout of Cholula accelerates its growth potential across the condiment platform and widens the product portfolio in the hot sauce category.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchSeveral other companies in the food space, like The Kraft Heinz Company KHC, Hormel Foods Corporation HRL and Tyson Foods, Inc. TSN, are benefiting from acquisitions.In April 2022, Kraft Heinz acquired a majority stake in a Brazil-based condiments and sauces company — Companhia Hemmer Industria e Comercio (""Hemmer""). The buyout widened Kraft Heinz's International Taste Elevation platform and enhanced its presence across emerging markets. In January 2022, KHC acquired an 85% stake in Germany-based Just Spices GmbH (“Just Spices”). The buyout enhanced its direct-to-consumer operations and go-to-market expansion.Hormel Foods is strengthening its business through strategic acquisitions. In June, HRL acquired the Planters snacking portfolio from Kraft Heinz. Prior to this, it acquired Texas-based pit-smoked meats company Sadler's Smokehouse in March 2020. The buyout was in sync with Hormel Foods’ initiatives to strengthen its position in the foodservice space.Tyson Foods is focused on expanding into international markets as part of its strategic growth plan. In Jul 2022, TSN announced its strategic partnership with Tanmiah Food Company (Tanmiah) — a leading Middle East provider of fresh and processed poultry, other processed meat products, animal feed and health products. The acquisitions will allow Tyson Foods to access poultry supplies across Saudi Arabia to cater to the rising protein demand in the Middle East and other markets.Story continuesWhat Else is Working Well for McCormick?Meanwhile, McCormick regularly enhances products through innovation to remain competitive and tap the evolving demand for new flavors, spices and herbs. Aided by a sturdy brand image, McCormick enjoys strong retail acceptance for its new products. Additionally, the company is on track to augment robust marketing support for its products. New product launches are integral to the company’s growth. Management is leveraging its broad technology platform to develop clean-label, organic and better-for-you solutions amid rising consumer’s health consciousness.McCormick’s cost savings are likely to keep aiding growth. The company is focused on saving costs and enhancing productivity through the ongoing Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (“CCI”) program. Started in 2009, McCormick’s CCI program helped the company reduce costs and enhance productivity. It has used CCI savings to increase investments, leading to higher sales and profits. Management expects to achieve CCI-led cost savings of nearly $85 million in 2022.We believe that such well-chalked saving efforts and the aforementioned upsides will likely keep McCormick well-positioned in the food space.MKC’s stock has increased 7.2% in the past three months compared with the industry’s 7.9% growth.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

208,3da9bb77-af57-3ca6-90ab-abdcb283c7e5,MKC,2022-12-21,General Mills (GIS) Ups Guidance on Q2 Earnings & Sales Beat,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/general-mills-gis-ups-guidance-151603062.html,1671549363,STORY,"['GIS', 'MKC-V']","[General Mills, Inc. GIS posted solid second-quarter fiscal 2023 results as the top and bottom lines grew year over year and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Considering impressive first-half results and robust business momentum, management pulled up its fiscal 2023 organic net sales, adjusted operating profit and adjusted earnings per share (EPS) growth guidance.Management stated that it remains focused on executing its Accelerate strategy amid the ongoing volatility in the operating landscape. To this end, it has been committed to brand building and innovation, solidifying its capacities and reshaping its portfolio. GIS is on track with prioritizing core markets, global platforms and local brands, along with reshaping its portfolio via strategic acquisitions and divestitures.Quarterly HighlightsGeneral Mills posted adjusted earnings of $1.10 per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.06 and our estimate of $1.04. The bottom line rose 12% year over year on a constant-currency (cc) basis. The upside can be mainly attributed to the elevated adjusted operating profit, the reduced adjusted effective tax rate and decreased net shares outstanding, somewhat negated by the reduced benefit plan non-service income.General Mills, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseGeneral Mills, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseGeneral Mills, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | General Mills, Inc. QuoteGIS reported net sales of $5,220.7 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5,150 million and our estimate of $5,106.7 million. The top line advanced 4% from the year-ago quarter’s figure. The metric included a five-point unfavorable impact of net divestitures and acquisition activity and a one-point adverse impact of currency movements.Organic net sales rose 11% due to the favorable organic net price realization and mix. These were somewhat offset by the reduced organic pound volume.The adjusted gross margin expanded 100 basis points (bps) to 33.2% due to the positive net price realization and mix, along with gains from Holistic Margin Management (“HMM”) cost savings. These were somewhat offset by input cost inflation, supply-chain deleverage and the increased other costs of goods sold.The cc adjusted operating profit rose 7%, backed by increased adjusted gross profit dollars, somewhat offset by higher adjusted SG&amp;A expenses. The adjusted operating profit margin expanded 60 bps to 16.9%.Story continuesSegmental PerformanceNorth America Retail: Revenues in the segment came in at $3,373.1 million, up 11% year over year. The uptick can be attributed to the positive net price realization and mix, which somewhat offset the reduced pound volume, and the helper and Suddenly Salad divestiture.Organic net sales grew 13% year over year. The segment’s operating profit increased 24% to $837 million.International: Revenues in the segment came in at $671.7 million, down 27% year over year. The downside can be attributed to the reduced pound volume, which includes the impact of yogurt and dough divestitures, as well as the ice cream recall. Also, the adverse impact of unfavorable currency rates is a headwind. That said, the favorable net price realization and mix offered some respite.Organic net sales grew 5% year over year due to advancements in Brazil, distributor markets, and Europe and Australia, partly negated by softness in China. The segment’s operating profit slumped from $59 million to $18 million.Pet: Revenues came in at $592.9 million, flat year over year, as the positive net price realization and mix were countered by the reduced pound volume. Organic sales also remained flat year over year.Management expects the Pet sales performance to speed up in the second half of fiscal 2023, led by higher capacity, better customer service, elevated brand-building investment and anticipation of stable retailer inventory levels. The segment’s operating profit came in at $87 million compared with the $132 million reported in the year-ago period.North America Foodservice: Revenues came in at $583 million, up 24% year over year, reflecting the positive net price realization and mix, including a benefit of five points from market index pricing on bakery flour. Net sales also included a six-point gain from the TNT Crust buyout.Organic sales rose 17%. The segment’s operating profit jumped 20% to $82 million.Other Financial AspectsGeneral Mills ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $644.1 million, long-term debt of $8,622.5 million and total shareholders’ equity of $10,121.2 million.GIS generated $1.2 million in net cash from operating activities through the first six months of fiscal 2023. Capital investments amounted to $227 million during the same period. The company paid out dividends worth $648 million and bought roughly 12.1 million shares for $901 million in the said time frame.Other DevelopmentsCc sales from the joint ventures of Cereal Partners Worldwide increased 2%. In Haagen-Dazs Japan, sales fell 10% at cc from the prior-year figure.Fiscal 2023 GuidanceGeneral Mills expects that the biggest factors impacting its show in fiscal 2023 are likely to be consumers’ economic status, cost inflation and supply-chain bottlenecks.GIS anticipates volume elasticities to remain lower than historical levels in the second half of the fiscal. Compared with its previous fiscal 2023 guidance, management now anticipates greater organic net sales growth due to improved volume performance and a better price/mix.For fiscal 2023, management expects input cost inflation of 14-15% percent of the total cost of goods sold. Management continues to expect HMM cost savings of 3-4% of the cost of goods sold. It also expects moderately reduced supply-chain hurdles and greater investments in brand building and other growth-driving initiatives compared with the year-ago period.For fiscal 2023, organic net sales are anticipated to increase 8-9%. Earlier, management expected organic net sales growth of 6-7%. The net impact of divestitures, acquisitions and foreign currency movements is likely to lower full-year reported net sales growth by about 4.5%.The adjusted operating profit growth at cc is now anticipated at 3-5%. Earlier, the metric was anticipated between flat and an increase of 3%. Both views include a three-point net adverse impact of divestitures and buyouts and a one-point headwind of the ice cream recall.Adjusted EPS growth at cc is now envisioned between 4% and 6%. Previously, adjusted EPS growth at cc was expected to rise 2-5%. The raised guidance reflects greater adjusted operating profit growth and increased net interest expenses. The guidance includes a three-point net adverse impact of divestitures and buyouts and a one-point headwind of the ice cream recall.Currency woes are still likely to have a nearly 1% adverse impact on the adjusted operating profit and the adjusted EPS.

MDLZ is committed to reshaping its portfolio to focus on areas with greater growth potential, such as its chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks categories. Moving on these lines, the company inked a deal to divest its developed-market gum business (in the United States, Canada and Europe, excluding France) to Perfetti Van Melle Group, a renowned European maker of gum and confectionery products.The deal is anticipated to conclude in the fourth quarter of 2023. It includes the sale of manufacturing facilities in Rockford, IL, and Skarbimierz, Poland, as well as the Trident, Dentyne, Stimorol, Hollywood, V6, Chiclets, Bubbaloo and Bubblicious gum brands in the United States, Canada and Europe. It also includes the sale of European candy brands — Cachou Lajaunie, Negro and La Vosgienne.Mondelez will continue to operate its gum business outside the United States, Canada and Europe, along with all its other candy brands and products. MDLZ is progressing well with its Vision 2030 strategy, which is aimed at doubling down the company’s core snacking categories. The strategy also aims at generating 90% of the company’s revenues from chocolates and biscuits (including baked snacks).Mondelez has been keen on expanding its snacking category in particular. As consumers prefer snacking over traditional meals, the company’s core categories — chocolates and biscuits — have historically depicted resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions. Consumers in developed countries consider chocolates and biscuits as affordable indulgences and one of the most-valued snacking products.What Else to Know?Apart from undertaking divestitures, Mondelez has been enhancing its business through meaningful acquisitions. In its third-quarter 2022 earnings release, the company noted that it closed the Ricolino buyout, which is expected to double the size of its Mexico business. In August 2022, it closed the buyout of Clif Bar.  Management announced incremental investments in the Cocoa Life program and expanded its target to source all cocoa volumes from Cocoa Life by 2030. Mondelez concluded the integration of Chipita S.A. business, which was acquired in January 2022 and is a major producer of sweet and salty snacks in Central and Eastern Europe. Contributions from this acquisition boosted net revenues in the third quarter.In 2021, Mondelez took over a renowned sports performance and active nutrition brand — Grenade. Further, the company acquired the Australia-based food company — Gourmet Food Holdings — which operates in the premium biscuit and cracker category.Moreover, Mondelez completed the acquisition of Hu Master Holdings, the parent company of Hu Products, on Jan 4, 2021. Earlier, the company acquired the majority interest in Give &amp; Go (in April 2020), which is a pioneer in fully finished sweet baked goods.Thus, MDLZ’s focus on refining the portfolio through prudent acquisitions and divestitures bodes well.

Recovery initiatives in the region were dull in 2021, as most countries maintained tight border restrictions. However, the report by World Travel &amp; Tourism Council demonstrates that the Asia-Pacific is forecasted to bridge the gap this year, and travel revenue contribution to the economy will increase by nearly 71%. Travel restrictions were first lifted in India and Australia, followed by Malaysia, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian countries. Later, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also opened up. The report suggests ongoing gains to Asia-Pacific’s travel sector in 2023, and the year after that is also expected to bring positive growth in the industry. By 2025, travel revenue will provide 32% more to the Asian GDP than it did pre-pandemic.As per a Bloomberg report dated December 13, China’s swift reopening and easing of Covid Zero policies has initiated a solid rebound in the world’s largest domestic air travel market, which is a positive catalyst for the ‘Big Three’ Chinese airlines, which have suffered billions of dollars in losses since the beginning of the pandemic.

Will it be clear skies ahead, or is turbulence still in the cards for 2023? We have Stephanie Trent, who is the Citi research analyst, here to discuss. Great to have you here with us this morning.When you think about the holiday travel that we're seeing and the demand, even coming into this holiday travel season, that airline executives are continuing to point out and say this is either the golden age of travel or that demand is extremely strong, how far does that continue to hold true if we continue to see consumers pull back on some of their discretionary spending?STEPHEN TRENT: Well, appreciate the time, and thanks very much for having me on. So I do think that this ongoing demand has some legs. You still have a lot of pent-up demand out there from people that have not been able to get out over the last two years. So one of the consequences of what seems to be happening in the economy is perhaps a shift from a lot of consumption of stay from home, work from home pandemic era-type items that were very popular to, quote unquote, ""reopening.""And it sounds stale to say reopening because we've been open, but you have that ongoing shift from goods to services, and you have a dearth of airline capacity per capita that's supporting pricing. So we think that there's still revenue headwind out there over the next couple of quarters.- Well, Stephen, to that point, I mean, man, these stocks have not done well. Considering how much we keep talking about how the travel industry is booming, American down 30% this year, Alaska, Delta down 15%. Why haven't these stocks done better, and what can we expect from them going into 2023?Story continuesSTEPHEN TRENT: Sure, great question. So it has been a tough year overall. So as you said, Alaska is down this year. The S&amp;P is down a little more. So the broad market has not been easy. We spent a lot of time this year with investors going risk off. We started with Omicron, then we went to a fuel spike, and now we're dealing with higher interest rates.With all of that, we have seen earnings return. We've seen some carriers out there, such as Delta, telegraphing that they will generate multibillion-dollar levels of free cash flow over the coming years. So I would say there is at least somewhat of a disconnect at the moment between what kind of numbers these companies are putting up and price action in the market. But certainly, the market itself hasn't done great. So you actually have seen some carriers do a little better than the market itself even though they're also down.- Stephen, you have a buy rating on United. And United recently made some headlines with a giant order of some new Boeing airplanes. How do you think those new planes will transform their profits looking out over the next decade?STEPHEN TRENT: Sure. So I have to be-- maybe I can give you an industry answer on that one. What we've seen across the big three is a need to modernize their fleets, a need to update their aircraft, so moving away from the sub-120 seat range into these larger-gauge aircraft that have really good seat across profiles versus the smaller ones.So in terms of what that potentially means from the earnings perspective, I think, is the relevant thing to focus on now, certainly when you get big orders come in. And I'm speaking generally here. Definitely, there can be some concerns around capex and how a particular airline is going to fund a fleet upgrade. But these fleet upgrades can really make a big difference in terms of economic performance and fuel efficiency. So I think that's the more relevant piece of the pie longer term, even though short term, yes, elements of the market could have a knee-jerk reaction to what happens with capex.- Do you believe that that will drive more of these partnerships, more of these alliances? And we also do have a short clip from the Mesa Airlines CEO off of their most recent alliance. And this is just one of many. But let's roll the clip real quick, and then we'll come back to it on the other side.JONATHAN ORNSTEIN: When we first wanted to set up a meeting to talk about a wind-down, they said, don't even bother coming to Dallas. We don't want to talk about a wind-down. In fact, not only did they try to incentivize us, they offered us an extension of the contract. So I just have a problem with that because it really denigrates the hard work of all my people. And the bottom line is we went to them because we were losing so much, like $5 million a month, and just said, look, we need to get out so that we can continue to operate the business and provide jobs for 3,500 people.- OK. And so do you believe that, given what you were mentioning a moment ago in the capex scrutiny, that there could be-- if there were just additional planes purchased, that we'll see more of the partnerships like Mesa and United, and even like we had seen in the northeast alliance between American Airlines and JetBlue?STEPHEN TRENT: Yeah, so I think that we are in a transition period at the moment. So I think there are cyclical things that have been associated with the COVID pandemic, and then I also think there are some structural things. So speaking of the latter, for example, over a long term, regional, I would argue, has been having a tougher time for a while.The market's continuing to move to mainline. Airlines, for years, have been moving to larger-gauge aircraft. And we've seen, for example, all of the major aircraft manufacturers respond to that. All of the newer versions of planes that come out, virtually all have more seats on them.So I think in terms of alliances and what could get agreed to or what airlines could agree to going forward, absolutely, I think we are going to see out-of-the-box-type opportunities to form alliances that will not necessarily be within any particular existing global alliance like Star or Oneworld. So absolutely, I think there's a chance we see more of this because of those structural items that I mentioned.- If we are indeed-- and a question on capacity here, I suppose-- if we are indeed headed into a recession that's going to dampen the amount of travelers or the propensity for leisure travel and even see some cutback on corporate travel, which is already trying to rebound to the best extent possible right now, what does that mean for the need for capacity to actually be restored to pre-pandemic levels?STEPHEN TRENT: Yeah, absolutely. So what we've actually seen in some of our recent survey work has been a little bit of softness in domestic managed business travel. So I think part of that is, yes, coming from interest rates going higher. Some of that is coming from Zoom and TelePresence supplanting some in-person meetings that would have been done on a pre-pandemic level.And then I think you also now have blended business travel. So one of the structural items, for example, is a lot of people are no longer in the office five days a week. So maybe they're doing three days live and two days remote. That creates more flexibility around what we could see in terms of blended trips now, people traveling for business/personal reasons as opposed to a pure business trip.In terms of capacity coming back and what could happen on the pandemic level-- excuse me-- I'm sorry-- on the economic level with rates going up and maybe some slowdown, a whole bunch of pieces to that. So one of the things-- that the other things that we're seeing, for example, is international momentum, in several instances, is actually overtaking the booking curve momentum we see in the US market. So those network carriers with very good international exposure, very good transatlantic exposure like Delta, for example, probably going to continue seeing revenue tailwinds as some of these international corridors appear to be six to nine months behind the United States domestic in terms of their recovery.The other thing high level that we would be thinking about is if we are indeed going into an economic slowdown, what are the implications for oil prices? So they have come off a bit. Jet fuel kerosene has come off a little less than oil prices, for example, but they've still come down. So I think the confluence of those factors and some continued shift away from goods and into services is not necessarily a bad setup for the network majors.- Great analysis for us here today. Citi analyst Stephen Trent, good to see you. Happy holidays.STEPHEN TRENT: You too. Thank you.]"

Air-travel demand made a stronger-than-expected recovery as people are again booking flights, thereby boosting passenger revenues, which account for the bulk of most airlines' top lines. Airline players like Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines and United Airlines are likely to benefit from robust demand for air travel.However, high fuel costs are limiting bottom-line growth. Moreover, the labor crunch that is currently being faced by the airline industry is another woe.About the IndustryThe Zacks Airline industry includes players engaged in transporting passengers and cargo to various destinations globally. Most operators maintain a fleet of multiple mainline jets in addition to several regional planes. Operations are aided by their regional airline subsidiaries and third-party regional carriers.Additionally, industry players utilize their respective cargo divisions to offer a wide range of freight and mail services. The players invest substantially to upgrade technology. The industry, apart from comprising legacy carriers, includes low-cost players. The well-being of companies in this group is linked to the health of the overall economy. For example, the aviation space was one of the worst pandemic-hit corners, with passenger revenues taking a severe beating. However, air-travel demand is rosy now.The focus on boosting cargo revenues is an added positive.Key Themes Governing the Airline IndustryIATA's Bullish Forecast: Following the removal of coronavirus-induced restrictions, pent-up demand is driving traffic for the airlines. Despite inflationary pressures and supply-chain woes, there is a wave of optimism surrounding air-travel demand. The buoyant scenario with respect to air-travel demand is expected to improve further in 2023. As a result, airlines are expected to return to profitability next year. Per the International Air Transport Association (IATA), net profits for airlines across the globe are likely to be $4.7 billion in 2023. The top line next year is anticipated to be $779 billion compared with the current-year estimate of $727 billion.Story continuesWith people again taking to the skies, the greatest driver of top-line improvement is passenger revenues. Per IATA, passenger revenues for the next year are anticipated to be $522 billion (85.5% of 2019 [pre-coronavirus] levels). The 2023 projection is higher than the current-year estimate of $438 billion, despite economic uncertainties.Bottom Line Suffers Due to Oil Price Increase: Even though oil price declined from its multi-year highs due to recession fears, it remains high. Notably, oil prices increased 5.7% in the first nine months of 2022, induced by the Russia-Ukraine war. Per IATA's December forecast, the current-year fuel bill for the industry is projected at $222 billion, higher than the forecast of $192 billion made in June.Focus on Cargo Revenues: An Added Positive: The focus of airlines on boosting cargo revenues bodes well for top-line growth, especially in the current scenario where passenger revenues are rebounding strongly from the pandemic lows. Per IATA's forecast, cargo revenues are expected to be $201.4 billion. That is an improvement in 2022, which is way above the 2019 actual of $100.8 billion. Cargo revenues in 2023 are expected to be $149.4 billion, which is lower than the current-year projection but still $48.6 billion higher than the 2019 actuals.Staffing Crunch a Bane: The airline industry in the United States is being plagued by tensions on the labor front. With airlines trimming their labor force substantially during the peak of the pandemic, the industry is grappling with a staff crunch as demand bounces back. Due to labor scarcity, many U.S. airlines trimmed their capacity, which in turn, is likely to drain profitability. Reduced capacity is pushing up non-fuel unit costs. IATA expects total costs in 2023 to increase 5.3% to 5.3% to $776 billion. The increase is likely to be mainly due to labor, skill and capacity shortages.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Sunny ProspectsThe Zacks Airline industry is a 29-stock group within the broader Zacks Transportation sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #84, which places it in the top 34% of 250 plus Zacks industries.The group's Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.Before we present a few stocks that you may want to retain in your portfolio, let's look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and its valuation picture.Industry Underperforms Sector but Outperforms S&amp;P 500 The Zacks Transportation - Airline industry has outperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite while underperforming broader Transportation sector over the past year.The industry has declined 15.4% over this period compared with the S&amp;P 500's depreciation of 17.2% and the broader sector's decrease of 12.6%.The Valuation PictureThe Price/Sales (P/S) ratio is often used to value airline stocks. The industry currently has a forward 12-month P/S of 0.37X compared with the S&amp;P 500's 3.31X. It is also below the sector's forward-12-month P/S of 1.56X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.01X, as low as 0.32X and at the median of 0.68X.3 Transportation - Airline Stocks to Keep Tabs OnUnited Airlines has a market capitalization of $12.56 billion, presently. On the back of upbeat air-travel demand, UAL was profitable in the third quarter of 2022. The third quarter was the second consecutive profitable quarter at UAL since the onset of the pandemic. Management stated that air-travel demand and pricing are still strong. These factors should boost fourth-quarter results.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings has moved 7.6% north at UAL. United Airlines carries a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy), currently.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks hereThe gradual improvement in air-travel demand in the United States is a huge boon for Southwest Airlines, based in Dallas, and currently having a market cap of $22.14 billion.Driven by the continued strength witnessed with respect to passenger yield, LUV expects fourth-quarter 2022 operating revenues to increase in the 13-17% band from the fourth-quarter 2019 actuals. Fleet-modernization efforts of LUV are encouraging as well.Following the lifting of restrictions under the CARES Act, which prohibited airlines from paying dividends till Sep 30, 2022, Southwest Airlines' management reinstated its quarterly dividend of 18 cents per share. With the carrier returning to profitability in March 2022 and expecting to be profitable for full-year 2022 as well, the decision was hugely expected. The dividend will be paid on Jan 31, 2023 to its shareholders of record at the close of business on Jan 10.Southwest Airlines' earnings outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters. The average beat is 54.7%. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2022 earnings has moved 3.1% north at LUV. Currently, LUV carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Delta has a market capitalization of $21.23 billion, presently. DAL, based in Atlanta, GA, is being bolstered by the uptick in demand for air travel (particularly for leisure). Driven by upbeat air-travel demand, Delta expects fourth-quarter 2022 operating margin to be 11%, i.e. at the top of the previously guided 9-11% range.DAL now expects adjusted earnings per share in the $1.35-$1.40 range (the earlier outlook was in the range of $1-$1.25). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $1.20. Total revenues are now likely to increase in the 7-8% range from fourth-quarter 2019 actuals (the earlier outlook was for an increase in the 5-9% range).Delta's earnings outshined the Zacks Consensus Estimate in two of the last four quarters (missing the mark in the remaining ones). The average beat is 7.9%. DAL carries a Zacks Rank #3, currently.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

(NYSE:PNC) insiders sold a substantial stake in the company which may have sparked shareholders' attention. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for PNC Financial Services Group The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At PNC Financial Services GroupOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Executive VP and Head of Corporate &amp; Institutional Banking, Michael Lyons, for US$1.0m worth of shares, at about US$183 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$150. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Over the last year we saw more insider selling of PNC Financial Services Group shares, than buying.

In total, Executive VP Deborah Guild sold US$452k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Story continuesDoes PNC Financial Services Group Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It's great to see that PNC Financial Services Group insiders own 0.3% of the company, worth about US$206m. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.What Might The Insider Transactions At PNC Financial Services Group Tell Us?An insider sold PNC Financial Services Group shares recently, but they didn't buy any. Despite some insider buying, the longer term picture doesn't make us feel much more positive. But it is good to see that PNC Financial Services Group is growing earnings. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing PNC Financial Services Group.

(NASDAQ:ADI) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Recent times have been advantageous for Analog Devices as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to persist, which has raised the P/E. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Analog Devices peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Analog Devices.Does Growth Match The High P/E?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Analog Devices' to be considered reasonable.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a terrific increase of 51%. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 47% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. Accordingly, shareholders would have probably welcomed those medium-term rates of earnings growth.Turning to the outlook, the next three years should generate growth of 12% each year as estimated by the analysts watching the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.2% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Analog Devices is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Key TakeawayWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Analog Devices' analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.You always need to take note of risks, for example - Analog Devices has 1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.If you're unsure about the strength of Analog Devices' business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

The timing of Indonesia's ban, however, is in line with its current mining law.The president said the bauxite ban aimed to replicate Indonesia's success in developing its nickel processing capacity after halting exports of its raw form in January 2020, which enticed foreign investors, mostly from China, to build local smelters.The measure, which led to a dispute at the World Trade Organization (WTO), also helped boost the value of Indonesia's exports.""The government will remain consistent in implementing downstreaming so the value add can be enjoyed domestically for the country's development and people's welfare,"" said Widodo, who is popularly known as Jokowi, emphasising the importance of jobs creation.China was the biggest importer of Indonesia's bauxite until Jakarta introduced a mineral export ban in 2014, which it lifted in 2017.According to Wen Xianjun, a former head of the aluminium department at the China Nonferrous Metals Industry Association, Indonesia's 2014 ban prompted China to boost its efforts to develop aluminium resources in Africa instead.""Compared with then, China's imports of bauxite are more diversified now,"" Wen said.China imported 17.8 million tonnes of Indonesian bauxite in 2021, and 17.98 million tonnes in the first 11 months this year, about 15.6% of its total imports, according to customs data.Story continuesLIMITED PRICE IMPACTThe three-month aluminium futures contract on the London Metal Exchange rose 0.6% at $2,386.50 a tonne by 0530 GMT, while the most-traded aluminium contract on the Shanghai Futures Exchange was up 0.2% to 18,595 yuan a tonne.The announcement by Indonesia is not expected to have significant impact on prices.""It won't cause any major supply headwind as Indonesia now only accounts for a relatively small share of China's supply, Guinea and Australia will immediately make up the lost volume (after the ban),"" an aluminium trader at a large trading house in China said.Indonesia has four bauxite processing facilities with 4.3 million tonnes of alumina output capacity, while more are under construction with collective capacity of nearly 5 million tonnes, said chief economic minister Airlangga Hartarto.Indonesia's bauxite reserves are enough for up to 100 years production, he said.The country's mining law also states exports of other unprocessed minerals such as copper will also be stopped. Jokowi did not specify the timing of shipment bans on the other materials.He said there was a possibility that legal action could be pursued against Indonesia for banning bauxite exports, but it would not deter him. The WTO last month ruled in favour of the European Union in a dispute on nickel ore exports, which Indonesia is appealing.(Reporting by Fransiska Nangoy, Bernadette Christina, Stanley Widianto, Ananda Teresia; Additional reporting Siyi Liu; Writing by Fransiska Nangoy, Gayatri Suroyo; Editing by Martin Petty and Christian Schmollinger)]"

This was triggered by the Bank of Japan unexpectedly tweaking its ultra-loose monetary policy for the first time in nearly a decade.The BOJ increased the range within which the yields on benchmark Japanese government bonds are allowed to fluctuate, signaling that it may be open to tightening policy next year.The move follows hawkish signals from several other developed market central banks, and indicates that global interest rates are likely to rise further in 2023. While such a scenario bodes poorly for non-yielding assets such as gold, the prospect of an ensuing economic slowdown also boosted the yellow metal’s safe haven appeal.Spot gold rose 0.1% to $1,819.67 an ounce, while gold futures rose 0.2% to $1,828.55 an ounce by 20:11 ET (01:11 GMT). Both instruments surged nearly 2% on Tuesday, and were trading at a one-week high.Softer-than-expected U.S. housing data also ramped up fears of a recession in 2023- a scenario that could benefit gold, amid some speculation that the Federal Reserve is close to ending its cycle of interest rate hikes.This has seen the dollar relinquish a chunk of its gains this year. The greenback is now trading near six-month lows, after the Fed raised interest rates by a relatively smaller margin earlier this month.Still, investors remain uncertain over where U.S. interest rates will peak. Hawkish signals from other major central banks have also brewed uncertainty over monetary policy going into 2023.Other precious metals rallied on Tuesday and were trading steady on Wednesday.Among industrial metals, copper prices rose 0.3% to $3.8178 a pound on Wednesday, after jumping 0.7% in the previous session.Story continuesBut gains in the red metal were constrained by growing uncertainty over an economic reopening in major importer China, which is struggling with an unprecedented spike in COVID-19 infections.Fears of a potential recession in 2023 have also weighed on copper prices in recent sessions, given the metal’s close relationship with economic growth.Related ArticlesGold blazes past $1,800 as dollar sinks on BOJ policy shiftOil rises past U.S. storm jitters as inventories shrinkU.S. expands dispute settlement consultations over Canadian dairy tariff policies]"

Brazil led the advance, with its real up 1.7% against a weaker dollar, while Sao Paulo's Bovespa stock index gained 2.4% to hit a one-week high. Top Brazilian miner Vale rose 0.7%, while state-owned oil giant Petrobras gained 2.8%%. Prices of oil, industrial and precious metals rose, lifting assets of most commodity-export oriented countries in Central and South America. The Brazilian Supreme Court on Monday granted an injunction allowing President-elect Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva to increase social investment, while outlawing an opaque congressional spending program. Fitch affirmed Brazil's rating at ""BB-"" with a stable outlook. Chile's peso and Peru's sol added 0.4% and 0.2%, respectively, tracking firm copper prices. The Mexican peso was subdued, with investors nervous ahead of Mexico's inflation data this week. Headline inflation for Mexico is forecast to have rebounded in the first half of December after six fortnights of slowing, a Reuters poll showed, backing bets the Bank of Mexico will continue to hike interest rates. The Chilean economy faces a period of adjustment in the next two years to correct accumulated debts and bring down inflation, the central bank chief said. The MSCI's index for Latin American stocks gained 2.9%, against a 0.6% fall in the broader emerging markets equity index. ""The U.S. Federal Reserve actually out-hiked most EMs in Q4, compressing the policy rate differentials with all EM region,"" said Natalia Gurushina, emerging markets fixed income chief economist at VanEck in a note. ""This might be less of a problem in Latam, where the policy differential is still the widest. However, it remains to be seen whether this would be enough to compensate for the political noise and policy uncertainty in the region."" Most Asian and European markets were left reeling after Japan's central bank widened the allowable band for long-term yields to 50 basis points either side of its 0% target, from 25 basis points previously. The move stunned investors already worried about the economic fallout of rising interest rates and surging inflation, and was seen by many as a possible end to Japan's ultra-loose monetary policy. ""It's important not to underestimate the impact this could have, because tighter BoJ policy would remove one of the last global anchors that has helped to keep borrowing costs at low levels more broadly,"" Deutsche Bank analyst Henry Allen said in a client note. Also weighing on global sentiment was a surge in coronavirus infections in China, with many fearing a new wave of infections could further hit corporate supply chains. Stocks in China ended lower. China kept benchmark lending interest rates unchanged for the fourth consecutive month. Among other emerging markets, Hungary's forint slipped 0.2% against the euro after the country's central bank left interest rates unchanged.

Twenty-three constituents remained in CNE the entire fourth quarter and they all lost.Best performer: Adventure Gold, the native token of the NFT project Loot, lost 10.4% and is part of the DACS Gaming Industry assigned to the Metaverse Industry Group. It has leaned heavily on its non-fungible tokens (NFT) being free to use however folks please. As such, any new project looking to incorporate Loot tends to have a positive effect on the price of AGLD. This time it would appear to be a game called Endless Crawler.Worst performer: Rally (RLY), the token of the social tokens platform, lost 53% and is part of the DACS Social Industry assigned to the Media Industry Group. It dropped over 30% in the days after the FTX collapse and hasn’t been able to recover since.

The speed of 5G, combined with edge computing, further reduces the latency to support use cases, wherein near-real-time processing is critical.The edge computing industry is being shaped by several trends. With the rise of the Internet of Things (IoT), and the increasing need for greater data processing and analytics, the demand for edge computing is growing.According to a report by Grand View Research, the global edge computing industry is expected to attain a value of $11.24 billion by the end of 2022, and grow, witnessing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 38.9% from 2022 through 2030, reaching a value of $155.90 billion at the end of the forecast period.This is driving companies such as Arista Networks and Cloudflare to adopt edge solutions to better manage their data, reduce latency and improve overall user experience. With the rising demand for edge computing solutions, investors are pouring money into the space.Edge computing use cases are expanding, as businesses look for new ways to leverage the technology. Because 5G creates a bigger, faster medium to carry data, it can deliver the ultra-low latency required for many applications, including the widespread deployment of autonomous vehicles, advanced healthcare services such as remote telesurgery and the metaverse.Edge Computing Players Leading the Way to GrowthSome of the top companies leading the global edge computing industry are Microsoft Corp., Alphabet and NVIDIA. These are well-positioned to benefit from the secular tailwinds in the enterprise software and edge computing space.Story continuesMicrosoft has a large and diverse portfolio of products and services, from cloud computing and machine learning to artificial intelligence and IoT. This gives the company a unique advantage in the edge computing market, as it can offer customers a comprehensive solution that covers all their needs.

But we also understand that investors develop their own strategies, so we are constantly looking at the latest trends in value, growth, and momentum to find strong companies for our readers.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.Argo Group (ARGO) is a stock many investors are watching right now. ARGO is currently holding a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) and a Value grade of A. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 8.86. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 24.62. ARGO's Forward P/E has been as high as 14.93 and as low as 4.73, with a median of 9.22, all within the past year.Another notable valuation metric for ARGO is its P/B ratio of 0.77. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. ARGO's current P/B looks attractive when compared to its industry's average P/B of 1.47. Within the past 52 weeks, ARGO's P/B has been as high as 1.32 and as low as 0.52, with a median of 0.90.Value investors also love the P/S ratio, which is calculated by simply dividing a stock's price with the company's sales. This is a popular metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement, so they are often considered a better performance indicator. ARGO has a P/S ratio of 0.47. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.89.Story continuesThe Travelers Companies (TRV) may be another strong Insurance - Property and Casualty stock to add to your shortlist. TRV is a # 2 (Buy) stock with a Value grade of A.Shares of The Travelers Companies are currently trading at a forward earnings multiple of 12.50 and a PEG ratio of 2.28 compared to its industry's P/E and PEG ratios of 24.62 and 2.30, respectively.TRV's price-to-earnings ratio has been as high as 14.05 and as low as 10.46, with a median of 12.53, while its PEG ratio has been as high as 4.49 and as low as 1.87, with a median of 3.03, all within the past year.Furthermore, The Travelers Companies holds a P/B ratio of 2.15 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 1.47. TRV's P/B has been as high as 2.23, as low as 1.33, with a median of 1.64 over the past 12 months.These are just a handful of the figures considered in Argo Group and The Travelers Companies's great Value grade. Still, they help show that the stock is likely being undervalued at the moment. Add this to the strength of its earnings outlook, and we can clearly see that ARGO and TRV is an impressive value stock right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

248,a544b528-03b3-318d-85b5-ae555c0b9989,GPC,2022-12-21,2 Auto Stocks Up More Than 25% YTD That Still Have Room to Run,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-auto-stocks-more-25-132201390.html,1671542521,STORY,"['CAAS', 'GPC']","[Year 2022 has been a mixed bag for the auto space. While the demand for cars managed to remain strong, parts shortage (a byproduct of COVID-19 that got worsened by the Russia-Ukraine war) choked supplies, while low stockpiles impacted sales. Even though historically low new-vehicle inventories had been a thorn in the side of the sector, automakers found relief in affluent car shoppers ready to pay a hefty price for vehicles.As the curtains roll down on 2022, one set of challenges seems to be replaced by another.  We know that inventory levels are finally picking up as supply chain snafus are gradually starting to ease. While improving inventory levels should help meet pent-up demand through 2023, rising interest rates and uncertain economic conditions might play spoilsports.On that note, we have shortlisted two stocks from the Zacks Auto, Tires and Trucks sector —namely China Automotive Systems CAAS and Genuine Parts Company GPC — which have rallied at least 25% year to date and also appear well positioned for 2023. Before we delve into the stocks, let’s look at the trends likely to shape the sector’s destiny next year as well as some key projections regarding 2023 vehicle sales.Factors to Govern Auto Sector’s Path in 2023With challenges associated with new-vehicle production starting to abate, we are seeing noticeable improvements in the inventory levels. Strong production levels are likely to offer shoppers more vehicle options in 2023. Electric vehicle sales will continue to provide a major boost to overall vehicle sales. With many automakers planning to roll out new models, increased product availability and government incentives have set the stage for more than one million EV sales in the United States in 2023, per Cox Automotive.Cox Automotive forecasts new vehicle sales in 2023 to increase 3% year over year to 14.1 million units. Meanwhile, Edmunds estimates a 7% increase in new vehicle sales next year from the projected 13.8 million unit sales in 2022.Story continuesIndeed, the cost of vehicle financing is expected to keep rising, courtesy a hawkish Fed. To purchase the same vehicle at the same monthly payment, buyers are now forced to increase their down payment, which may result in new affordability challenges. But the expected fall in the price of vehicles in 2023 from the peak levels of 2022 is likely to provide some relief to buyers. J.P. Morgan Research predicts that prices will decline by around 2.5- 5% for new cars and by 10-20% for used cars in 2023. Nonetheless, high borrowing costs will make it difficult for less-affluent and subprime consumers to find affordable vehicle payments to suit their monthly budgets.It's yet to be seen if automakers resort to better incentives, sweeter financing deals and discounts to hold up the demand if customers get unwilling to shell more for these discretionary items.2 Auto Outperformers With More Upside PotentialChina Automotive Systems: The company manufactures and sells automotive systems and components in China. It is one of the leading suppliers of rack and pinion power steering gears for cars and light-duty vehicles.China Automotive Systems is seeing strong sales in China on the back of higher customer demand for its products. Robust demand for hydraulic products is driving its top line. In the last reported quarter, the firm’s Wuhu subsidiary sales, primarily Chery Auto, rose 50.2% year over year. Net sales in Brazil also shot up 51.9% year over year. Additionally, sales of electric power steering by CAAS’ Henglong KYB operation jumped 93.7% year over year. Last month, management raised the company’s revenue guidance for full-year 2022 to $540 million from $500 million estimated earlier. China Association of Automobile Manufacturers forecasts a 3% year-over-year uptick in vehicle sales in China. This bodes well for CAAS’ top-line growth next year. A low-leverage balance sheet (with total debt to capitalization of 12.4%) also provides the company financial flexibility to tap on growth opportunities.CAAS sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Value Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for China Automotive Systems’ 2023 sales implies 8% growth each in 2022 and 2023.CAAS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 321.7%, on average.  The stock has returned more than 145% in the year-to-date period.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Genuine Parts: Atlanta-based Genuine Parts distributes auto and industrial replacement parts across the United States, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Indonesia, France, the United Kingdom, Germany and Poland.Genuine Parts’ third-quarter results marked the company’s sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit sales growth and the ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit earnings growth. The KDG and Inneco acquisitions have bolstered the company’s Industrial segment. Other strategic bolt-on acquisitions, including Winparts, Rare Spares, PartsPoint and Alliance Automotive Group, are adding to the top-line growth of the Automotive segment. Genuine Parts projects 2022 revenues from Automotive and Industrial segments to increase 7-8% and 31-32%, respectively. Ongoing initiatives, such as the expedited rollout of the NAPA brand, digitization, footprint optimization efforts and investments in B2B and B2C omni-channel, bode well for the long run. GPC’s dividend aristocrat status boosts investors’ confidence.GPC carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and has a Value Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Genuine Part’s 2023 sales and revenues implies year-over-year growth of 3% and 5%, respectively. GPC has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of roughly 9.9%, on average. The stock has returned more than 25% in the year-to-date period.Year-To-Date Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

251,72745248-42fc-3ed2-ac7c-4c05a6ebdf17,DIS,2022-12-21,"Disney, Oracle and Adobe: Our lukewarm take on recent news and earnings",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/disney-oracle-adobe-lukewarm-recent-121521494.html,1671624921,STORY,"['DIS', 'ADBE', 'ORCL']","[This article first appeared on Simply Wall St News(“What’s a lukewarm take?” you ask – well, it’s definitely not a hot take – we would like to think it’s a more considered, insightful, and useful take on the news.)Disney: Avatar is meaningful for this quarter, managing costs is key in the long termDisney’s ( NYSE: DIS ) share price fell 4.7% on Monday after Avatar 2 had a weaker-than-expected opening weekend. The stock price hit a new 52-week low and is now down 57% from its May 2021 peak.The film earned $134 million in the US over the weekend, compared to the $175 million expected by analysts. However Disney’s own projection was for $135 to $150 million, so this won't be way off the mark.Our take: James Cameron, Avatar’s producer implied that the movie will need to make around $2 bln to break even - so there is a lot at stake. But it's way too early to say that the Avatar sequel won’t turn into a big earner for Disney.Disney is expected to earn $0.80 a share during the current quarter which is about $1.45 bln. So, the amount Avatar ultimately brings in could have a very meaningful impact on EPS for the quarter, and the stock price is likely to be very sensitive to the success of the movie over the next few weeks.But in the longer term, it’ll probably be cost-cutting that delivers value. In the last 12 months, Disney’s revenue was $82 bln, and only $3.2 bln of that made it to the bottom line. That leaves the company with a lot to work with.Is Oracle a growth company again?Oracle  ( NYSE: ORCL ) released an impressive set of second-quarter results last weekRevenue was up 18% year-on-year and comfortably ahead of consensus estimates. Normalized EPS of $1.21 also came in ahead of estimates, though GAAP EPS were slightly lower than expected.The highlight of the results was the impressive cloud growth, with:Cloud revenue up 43% to $3.8 bln, which is 31% of total revenue.Cloud IaaS (infrastructure as a service) revenue  up 53% to $1 blnCloud SaaS (software as a service) revenue up 53% to $1 blnStory continuesFurthermore, these growth numbers were quite a bit higher in constant currency terms.Our take:  The stock price initially gapped higher after the results, but quickly sold off. It appears investors saw this as an opportune time to take profits after the stock’s 40% rally since late September.Ahead of the results, Oracle’s trailing P/E ratio was 37x. With the updated trailing 12-month EPS number, it has fallen to 24.4x,  which is well below the Simply Wall St Fair P/E ratio of 40.7x.  (The fair P/E is a feature on the Simply Wall St stock reports which approximates the expected P/E ratio by accounting for earnings growth forecasts, profit margins, and risk factors. )Oracle’s growth hit a wall in 2011 and revenue remained flat through most of the last decade. The company was also late to join the cloud revolution, and when it did it took time to get traction. But, cloud now makes up a meaningful chunk of revenue and it’s growing quickly. The key question here is: how sustainable is the current cloud growth rate? Check out the  full report on Oracle,  which covers the valuation, analysts' expectations, and risks to be aware of.Adobe looks fully valuedThe market’s response to Adobe’s ( Nasdaq: ADBE ) fourth-quarter earnings report was generally positive. Revenue and EPS were up year-one-year and both slightly ahead of consensus, but growth has continued to slow since 2021.Our take:  Adobe is one of the companies that is a very obvious beneficiary of the ongoing digital transformation of the global economy. The company’s suite of creative tools is essential for creators from graphic designers to web developers, video editors, and photographers. If the acquisition of Figma goes ahead, it will further strengthen its product portfolio and add to its competitive advantage.Adobe also happens to have recurring revenue with very wide margins.The tricky part for investors is assessing a realistic growth trajectory and valuation. The price/multiple of 32x is quite high when you consider top and bottom line growth will probably fall into single figures during the current quarter.Analysts expect earnings growth to increase to around 15% in 2024, and beyond that very few analysts are prepared to make a call. Until there is a catalyst to reignite growth, upside could be limited.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

However, the P/E might be quite high for a reason and it requires further investigation to determine if it's justified.Recent times have been advantageous for Walt Disney as its earnings have been rising faster than most other companies. The P/E is probably high because investors think this strong earnings performance will continue. If not, then existing shareholders might be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. See our latest analysis for Walt Disney peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on Walt Disney.Does Growth Match The High P/E?Walt Disney's P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.Retrospectively, the last year delivered an exceptional 58% gain to the company's bottom line. Despite this strong recent growth, it's still struggling to catch up as its three-year EPS frustratingly shrank by 72% overall. Accordingly, shareholders would have felt downbeat about the medium-term rates of earnings growth.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 49% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to only expand by 9.2% each year, which is noticeably less attractive.In light of this, it's understandable that Walt Disney's P/E sits above the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are expecting this strong future growth and are willing to pay more for the stock.The Bottom Line On Walt Disney's P/EWe'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Story continuesAs we suspected, our examination of Walt Disney's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. It's hard to see the share price falling strongly in the near future under these circumstances.A lot of potential risks can sit within a company's balance sheet. Our free balance sheet analysis for Walt Disney  with six simple checks will allow you to discover any risks that could be an issue.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking at a few good candidates.

Recovery initiatives in the region were dull in 2021, as most countries maintained tight border restrictions. However, the report by World Travel &amp; Tourism Council demonstrates that the Asia-Pacific is forecasted to bridge the gap this year, and travel revenue contribution to the economy will increase by nearly 71%. Travel restrictions were first lifted in India and Australia, followed by Malaysia, Thailand, and other Southeast Asian countries. Later, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also opened up. The report suggests ongoing gains to Asia-Pacific’s travel sector in 2023, and the year after that is also expected to bring positive growth in the industry. By 2025, travel revenue will provide 32% more to the Asian GDP than it did pre-pandemic.As per a Bloomberg report dated December 13, China’s swift reopening and easing of Covid Zero policies has initiated a solid rebound in the world’s largest domestic air travel market, which is a positive catalyst for the ‘Big Three’ Chinese airlines, which have suffered billions of dollars in losses since the beginning of the pandemic.

The first arrived on the same ship - the Cadiz Knutsen - in November.New England depends on LNG and oil to fuel some power plants on the coldest days when most of the pipeline gas available to the region is used to heat homes and businesses.About half of the power generated in New England comes from gas-fired plants.The Cadiz Knutsen was expected to reach U.S. energy company Constellation Energy Corp's Everett LNG import terminal in Massachusetts on Wednesday.That would be only the second time an LNG vessel visited Everett since August, according to Refinitiv data.That's because New England gas buyers are competing with European utilities willing to pay around $33 per million British thermal units (mmBtu) for gas compared with just $5 in the United States.The Massachusetts port has imported just 18.1 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas as LNG during the first 11 months of this year.That is down from 19.8 bcf during the same period in 2021 and a five-year (2017-2021) average of 35.9 bcf, according to federal energy data.When U.S. energy company Exelon Corp owned the Everett LNG facility, that company said it used the terminal to import fuel for its Mystic power plant. Exelon also said it sold some LNG to utilities throughout New England to help them meet their peak demand needs.Exelon spun off Constellation earlier this year.(Reporting by Scott DiSavino; editing by Jonathan Oatis )]"

The stock is the top trending ticker on Yahoo Finance as of 5:30 a.m. ET.But the real standout from Nike's fiscal second quarter was the company noticeably working down its excess inventory — caused earlier this year by the economic pullback — compared to three months ago. It's an issue that has plagued profit margins (due to Nike aggressively liquidating merchandise) and the stock price, analysts have contended.Nike's inventory fell 3% sequentially, spurred by a high-single-digit percentage drop in units. Total inventory units are down by a double-digit percentage compared to the first fiscal quarter.Management told analysts on an earnings call it continues to focus on clearing inventory, particularly through off-price retail stores. Further progress is expected into calendar year 2023, including a more cautious approach to buying new inventory.""We believe the inventory peak is behind us actions as we're taking in the marketplace are working,"" Nike CEO John Donahoe said.The inventory improvement sets the stage for better profit margins for Nike in coming quarters, provided the global economy doesn't fall off a cliff.Yahoo Finance Analysis: Nike's EarningsThe GoodSales, gross profit margins, and earnings beat analyst estimates.Inventory levels fell in units sequentially.Management called out strong online sales in November.Sales strength has continued into December, execs said on the conference call.Fiscal-year sales now seen up by a low-teens percentage, up from a low-double-digit percentage previously.The Not So GoodInventory still increased 43% year over year.Gross profit margin fell 300 basis points year over year due to increased markdowns.Fiscal year gross profit margins still seen falling 200 to 250 basis points year over year.Sales in Greater China declined 10% year over year.Story continuesWhat Wall Street Is Saying""We believe Nike's 2Q performance proves the brand remains strong, margin drivers are intact (Direct to Consumer / Digital) and global demand is healthy. Looking ahead, we expect inventory and China-related issues to subside, driving margin improvements. We move our estimates higher and recommend purchasing Nike shares and selling Lululemon shares."" -Jefferies Randal Konik (Buy rating; $140 price target)""Going forward, we expect GM guidance to again prove conservative and flag that unlike the majority of retail seeing the pandemic revenue pull-forward weigh on top-line, NKE's seeing material N.A. strength, with wholesale an interestingly positive call-out this quarter.

As Nasdaq's CEO, she has successfully led the company in a new strategic direction,"" said current Chair Michael Splinter, who will become lead independent director.The move comes as Nasdaq is becoming a bigger player in the environmental, social and governance space, and as it champions board diversity.

But others argue splitting the jobs can cause confusion over who is in charge.California Public Employees' Retirement System, the largest U.S. pension fund, objects to combining the roles, while BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, does not, said securities law professor Ann Lipton of Tulane University School of Law.When the roles are combined, Blackrock would also like boards to have a lead independent director with certain substantive powers, she said.Story continuesAround 45% of public companies have dual CEO/chairperson roles, said Yale School of Management professor Jeffrey Sonnenfeld.""Despite public media discussion, there is NO research that indicates that the separation of roles led to superior performance or better governance,"" he said in an email.Intercontinental Exchange Inc, CME Group Inc and Cboe Global Markets Inc also have CEOs holding chairperson titles.

(NYSE:JNPR)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-juniper-networks-inc-nyse-184848490.html,1671562128,STORY,['JNPR'],"[Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE:JNPR) saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NYSE. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Today I will analyse the most recent data on Juniper Networks’s outlook and valuation to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Juniper Networks What Is Juniper Networks Worth?The share price seems sensible at the moment according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 24.27x is currently trading slightly below its industry peers’ ratio of 27.79x, which means if you buy Juniper Networks today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that Juniper Networks should be trading at this level in the long run, then there’s not much of an upside to gain over and above other industry peers. In addition to this, it seems like Juniper Networks’s share price is quite stable, which could mean there may be less chances to buy low in the future now that it’s trading around the price multiples of other industry peers. This is because the stock is less volatile than the wider market given its low beta.Can we expect growth from Juniper Networks?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by a double-digit 18% over the next couple of years, the outlook is positive for Juniper Networks. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? JNPR’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around industry price multiples. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at JNPR? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuate below the industry PE ratio?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on JNPR, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around industry price multiples. However, the optimistic forecast is encouraging for JNPR, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Juniper Networks as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

(NYSE:PX) insiders have a lot at stake",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/30-ownership-p10-inc-nyse-112050830.html,1671621650,STORY,['PX'],"[If you want to know who really controls P10, Inc. (NYSE:PX), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 30% stake, individual insiders possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.With such a notable stake in the company, insiders would be highly incentivised to make value accretive decisions.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of P10, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for P10 ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About P10?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.P10 already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at P10's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in P10. The company's largest shareholder is 210 Capital LLC, with ownership of 11%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 7.4% and 7.3% of the stock.We did some more digging and found that 10 of the top shareholders account for roughly 53% of the register, implying that along with larger shareholders, there are a few smaller shareholders, thereby balancing out each others interests somewhat.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Story continuesInsider Ownership Of P10The definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in P10, Inc.. It has a market capitalization of just US$1.2b, and insiders have US$369m worth of shares in their own names. That's quite significant. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 16% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over P10. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Private Equity OwnershipPrivate equity firms hold a 19% stake in P10. This suggests they can be influential in key policy decisions. Some might like this, because private equity are sometimes activists who hold management accountable. But other times, private equity is selling out, having taking the company public.Private Company OwnershipOur data indicates that Private Companies hold 11%, of the company's shares. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand P10 better, we need to consider many other factors. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for P10  you should be aware of.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The stock price hit a new 52-week low and is now down 57% from its May 2021 peak.The film earned $134 million in the US over the weekend, compared to the $175 million expected by analysts. However Disney’s own projection was for $135 to $150 million, so this won't be way off the mark.Our take: James Cameron, Avatar’s producer implied that the movie will need to make around $2 bln to break even - so there is a lot at stake. But it's way too early to say that the Avatar sequel won’t turn into a big earner for Disney.Disney is expected to earn $0.80 a share during the current quarter which is about $1.45 bln. So, the amount Avatar ultimately brings in could have a very meaningful impact on EPS for the quarter, and the stock price is likely to be very sensitive to the success of the movie over the next few weeks.But in the longer term, it’ll probably be cost-cutting that delivers value. In the last 12 months, Disney’s revenue was $82 bln, and only $3.2 bln of that made it to the bottom line. That leaves the company with a lot to work with.Is Oracle a growth company again?Oracle  ( NYSE: ORCL ) released an impressive set of second-quarter results last weekRevenue was up 18% year-on-year and comfortably ahead of consensus estimates. Normalized EPS of $1.21 also came in ahead of estimates, though GAAP EPS were slightly lower than expected.The highlight of the results was the impressive cloud growth, with:Cloud revenue up 43% to $3.8 bln, which is 31% of total revenue.Cloud IaaS (infrastructure as a service) revenue  up 53% to $1 blnCloud SaaS (software as a service) revenue up 53% to $1 blnStory continuesFurthermore, these growth numbers were quite a bit higher in constant currency terms.Our take:  The stock price initially gapped higher after the results, but quickly sold off. It appears investors saw this as an opportune time to take profits after the stock’s 40% rally since late September.Ahead of the results, Oracle’s trailing P/E ratio was 37x. With the updated trailing 12-month EPS number, it has fallen to 24.4x,  which is well below the Simply Wall St Fair P/E ratio of 40.7x.  (The fair P/E is a feature on the Simply Wall St stock reports which approximates the expected P/E ratio by accounting for earnings growth forecasts, profit margins, and risk factors. )Oracle’s growth hit a wall in 2011 and revenue remained flat through most of the last decade. The company was also late to join the cloud revolution, and when it did it took time to get traction. But, cloud now makes up a meaningful chunk of revenue and it’s growing quickly. The key question here is: how sustainable is the current cloud growth rate? Check out the  full report on Oracle,  which covers the valuation, analysts' expectations, and risks to be aware of.Adobe looks fully valuedThe market’s response to Adobe’s ( Nasdaq: ADBE ) fourth-quarter earnings report was generally positive. Revenue and EPS were up year-one-year and both slightly ahead of consensus, but growth has continued to slow since 2021.Our take:  Adobe is one of the companies that is a very obvious beneficiary of the ongoing digital transformation of the global economy. The company’s suite of creative tools is essential for creators from graphic designers to web developers, video editors, and photographers. If the acquisition of Figma goes ahead, it will further strengthen its product portfolio and add to its competitive advantage.Adobe also happens to have recurring revenue with very wide margins.The tricky part for investors is assessing a realistic growth trajectory and valuation. The price/multiple of 32x is quite high when you consider top and bottom line growth will probably fall into single figures during the current quarter.Analysts expect earnings growth to increase to around 15% in 2024, and beyond that very few analysts are prepared to make a call. Until there is a catalyst to reignite growth, upside could be limited.Have feedback on this article? Concerned about the content? Get in touch with us directly.

That is, insiders bought more stock than they sold.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. View our latest analysis for Oracle The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At OracleThe Independent Director Charles Moorman made the biggest insider purchase in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$1.3m worth of shares at a price of US$84.57 each. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, even at a higher price than the current share price (being US$80.50). While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. We always take careful note of the price insiders pay when purchasing shares. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock when an insider has bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price. Charles Moorman was the only individual insider to buy shares in the last twelve months.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below.

So take a peek at this free list of growing companies with insider buying.Insider Ownership Of OracleAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that Oracle insiders own 43% of the company, worth about US$93b. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Oracle Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. On a brighter note, the transactions over the last year are encouraging. Judging from their transactions, and high insider ownership, Oracle insiders feel good about the company's future. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

The Fed has signaled it intends to keep interest rates higher for longer, rather than the pause or pivot that investors were expecting.The Fed also said last week its benchmark rate may shoot higher than earlier forecasts as it works to tame inflation. Policy makers expect growth in gross domestic product to slow from earlier forecasts and unemployment to rise.A tight labor market is something the Fed is also watching. New data on unemployment for last week is due out later today. Companies have been laying off workers on the expectation that business will slow after growing too quickly during the pandemic, but November's job report was unexpectedly strong.Investors will also get data on housing, consumer confidence and personal consumption expenditures, a key Fed data point on inflation.Here are three things that could affect markets tomorrow:1. Home salesData on existing home sales is due out at 10:00 ET (15:00 GMT) amid a broad slowdown in housing as mortgage rates rise. Analysts expect an annualized 4.2 million increase for November compared with the prior reading of 4.43 million.2.

Media reports about these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts changing their ratings often affect a stock's price. Do they really matter, though?Let's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Micron (MU) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.Micron currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.71, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.71 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.Of the 27 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and two are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 66.7% and 7.4% of all recommendations.Brokerage Recommendation Trends for MUBroker Rating Breakdown Chart for MUCheck price target &amp; stock forecast for Micron here&gt;&gt;&gt;While the ABR calls for buying Micron, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.Are you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations.In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.Story continuesABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks RankAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.Another key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.Is MU a Good Investment?Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Micron, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has declined 71.6% over the past month to -$0.50.Analysts' growing pessimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates lower, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to plunge in the near term.The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) for Micron. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Therefore, it could be wise to take the Buy-equivalent ABR for Micron with a grain of salt.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Micron posted top and bottom-line growth of at least double-digit percentage ranges in several quarters due to heightened demand amid the pandemic-led work-and-learn-from-home wave.However, the trend broke in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, with its top and bottom lines plunging approximately 20% and 40%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis. The company blamed rapidly weakening consumer demand and substantial customer inventory adjustments across end markets as the main reason behind the dismal quarterly performance.The trend is likely to have continued in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as well. This is expected to have resulted in a drastic decline in revenues and earnings.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $4.08 billion, suggesting a 46.9% decrease from the year-earlier period’s revenues of $7.69 billion. The consensus mark for the bottom line stands at a loss of 2 cents per share, indicating a drastic decline from the year-ago quarter’s earnings of $2.16 per share.Micron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMicron Technology, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMicron Technology, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Micron Technology, Inc. QuoteSoft Consumer Spending to Hurt Q1 ResultsMicron’s overall first-quarter performance is likely to have been negatively impacted by soft consumer spending due to rising inflationary pressure and growing concerns over the global economic slowdown. Softened consumer spending has weakened the memory chip demand from the smartphone and personal computer end markets.Substantial customer inventory adjustments across end markets are expected to have hurt the overall financial performance in the first quarter. MU’s industrial end market customers are adjusting their DRAM and NAND memory chip purchases amid soft macroeconomic conditions.Story continuesData center operators are adjusting their memory and storage purchases due to the shortage of other components as well as reducing their inventories amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainties.Industry-wide component supply constraints across the automotive end market are expected to have hurt Micron’s top and bottom lines in the first quarter. The company expects a slowdown in its automotive end market demand as customers are rebalancing DRAM and NAND inventory levels to deal with non-memory semiconductor shortages and production challenges.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Computing and Networking business unit’s revenues is pegged at $1.79 billion, indicating a year-over-year decline of 47.4%. The Embedded Solutions Group division’s revenues are anticipated to have declined 37.7% to $760 million.The consensus mark for Micron’s Mobile Business Unit is pegged at $938 million, indicating a year-over-year decline of 50.8%. The Storage Business Unit’s revenues are forecast to plunge 45.2% to $630 million.Zacks Rank &amp; Stocks to ConsiderCurrently, Micron carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

282,f4ac13fd-db67-3201-8669-aa981373cf2f,YUM,2022-12-21,Pizza consumption is normalizing after a pandemic boom: Analyst,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/pizza-consumption-normalizing-pandemic-boom-160016238.html,1671552016,VIDEO,"['DPZ', 'YUM', 'PZZA']","[Bank of America Analyst Sarah Senatore joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss post-pandemic pizza sales, pizza stocks, and the outlook for profit growth within the pizza sector going into 2023.Video Transcript- After surging takeout demand in 2020 because of COVID-19, our next guest says sales of pizza are returning to some semblance of normalcy in 2022. And she predicts strong growth ahead for the carryout sector. Bank of America Analyst Sarah Senatore joins us now.Sarah, it's good to see you. Thanks for being here. Pizza has been a really interesting space, actually, over the last couple of years. What does normalcy look like when it comes to this business?SARAH SENATORE: Yeah, you're right. For a segment that's been around for a very long time, and for most of us, it's sort of a part of our if not daily, weekly or monthly existence. There's been a lot of change over the last couple of years, primarily catalyzed by COVID, I think.And, as you said, we do think that most of that was transitory. And we're getting back to a point that looks a lot more like it did pre-COVID, at least with respect to the rate of consumption or how people are accessing pizza with respect to carry out versus drive-thru. But pizza, like every other part of the restaurant industry, really saw a huge change with the onset of COVID in 2020 as everybody shifted to more at-home consumption. And, of course, the large pizza chains, that's really their stock and trade, is getting food to people to eat at home.So a big tailwind from a, like I said, from a consumption perspective certainly early on. But we've given a little bit of that back more recently. And I think now we're seeing collectively three-year trends or growth rates that are very consistent with what we saw before the pandemic hit.- Sarah, who's winning the pizza category on the third-party delivery side from your analysis?SARAH SENATORE: People who use aggregators are very loyal to the aggregators they use. And I think that's only been amplified by the subscription services. So what we see is that among the restaurant companies, when they partner with aggregators, they usually choose to partner across the board with all the aggregators because they find that there really is incrementality with each aggregator platform because they have a different customer base, whether it's because of geographic strength or just habit or certain other preferences that consumers have. So it's, I think, less about which aggregator's winning within a specific space and more from a restaurant's perspective the aggregators, what they offer in terms of access to customers.Story continues- Sarah, why have the burger and french fries stocks outperformed the pizza stocks this year? And can that continue next year?SARAH SENATORE: I think it is really a function of this normalization that we've been talking about. So when you think about pizza consumption, a real significant amount of pull forward, if you will, 2020 and into 2021. So we're seeing a bit of that correction or adjustment.The same-store sales growth at Domino's is now on a three-year basis 17% for the industry-- sorry, for the overall business. So 17% over three years is a pretty healthy, robust number. It ends up averaging somewhere in the 5 and 1/2% range.That's very consistent with what the previous run rates were. It's just that it has been distributed unevenly. So slower than that this year, although we're certainly seeing recovery and faster than the prior two years. So I think that is different from some of the other QSRs that have seen more what I'll call level loaded, more consistent growth, not as fast in 2020 or 2021 as the pizza restaurants, but faster in 2022.And again, I think what we'll see as we look out next year is that a lot of normalization has happened. And we should expect virtually all the restaurants to kind of reconverge on their historical rates, so faster for the pizza restaurants and potentially slower for some of the others.- Bank of America Analyst Sarah Senatore joining us today. Thanks so much for the pizza and other fast food analysis as well. Got us all hungry and ready for lunch here. Appreciate it, Sarah.]"

Insiders might have been better off holding onto their shares, given that the average selling price of US$283 is still below the current share price.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Aon The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AonThe President, Eric Andersen, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.1m worth of shares at a price of US$283 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at slightly below the current price (US$297). As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was only 5.7% of Eric Andersen's holding.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 4.40k shares worth US$1.3m. On the other hand they divested 9.65k shares, for US$2.7m. All up, insiders sold more shares in Aon than they bought, over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeI will like Aon better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of AonLooking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Aon insiders own about US$704m worth of shares (which is 1.1% of the company). I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Aon Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. While we feel good about high insider ownership of Aon, we can't say the same about the selling of shares. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Aon. At Simply Wall St, we've found that Aon has 2 warning signs (1 can't be ignored!) that deserve your attention before going any further with your analysis.Of course Aon may not be the best stock to buy.

However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Prologis'  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. Check out our latest analysis for Prologis How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Prologis is:11% = US$4.2b ÷ US$40b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.11 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Prologis' Earnings Growth And 11% ROETo start with, Prologis' ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 6.9% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. This certainly adds some context to Prologis' decent 17% net income growth seen over the past five years.As a next step, we compared Prologis' net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 12%.Story continuespast-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is PLD fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Prologis Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Prologis seems to be paying out most of its income as dividends judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 51%, meaning the company retains only 49% of its income. However, this is typical for REITs as they are often required by law to distribute most of their earnings. Despite this, the company's earnings grew moderately as we saw above.Additionally, Prologis has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 112% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 6.5%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Prologis' performance. In particular, its high ROE is quite noteworthy and also the probable explanation behind its considerable earnings growth. Yet, the company is retaining a small portion of its profits. Which means that the company has been able to grow its earnings in spite of it, so that's not too bad. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

289,3a10ab70-b53e-3b6e-90db-5b9f96e28348,PLD,2022-12-21,"Terreno Realty (TRNO) Sees Demand, Leases California Asset",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/terreno-realty-trno-sees-demand-135901929.html,1671544741,STORY,"['TRNO', 'PLD', 'REXR-PC']","[Terreno Realty TRNO is witnessing healthy demand for its properties and has announced the execution of a lease renewal for 110,000 square feet in Commerce, CA, with a third-party logistics provider. As a result, the lease will expire in April 2028 instead of March 2023.Last month, Terreno Realty announced an early lease renewal of 63,000 square feet in Jamaica Queens, NY, with a global freight forwarding provider. Consequently, the lease will expire in December 2027 instead of December 2022. These lease renewals reflect the solid demand for the company’s properties.Amid an e-commerce boom, growth in industries and companies making efforts to improve supply-chain efficiencies, demand for industrial real estate space has been shooting up. TRNO is banking on such opportunities and is focused on expanding its portfolio through acquisitions.Apart from the fast adoption of e-commerce, industrial real estate space is poised to gain traction over the long run from a likely rise in the inventory levels of companies as a precaution for any supply-chain disruption. This will offer opportunities to industrial landlords, including Terreno Realty, Prologis PLD and Rexford Industrial Realty REXR, to enjoy a favorable market environment.TRNO recently shelled out $15.4 million to purchase an industrial property in Elizabeth, NJ. Located at 629 Henry Street, this property comprises one industrial distribution building containing roughly 23,000 square feet on 1.8 acres. It is 100% leased on a short-term basis. The property’s advantageous location — adjacent to the Newark Liberty International Airport and Exit 13A of the New Jersey Turnpike — is likely to lure tenants.In the third quarter, Terreno Realty noted that for its operating portfolio, the occupancy reached 98.4% as of Sep 30, 2022, marking an expansion of 50 basis points (bps) from the prior quarter-end and 40 bps from the year-ago quarter-end. Moreover, its same-store portfolio was 98.9% leased on Sep 30, 2022.Terreno Realty was able to lock in higher rents on new and renewed leases, reflecting resilience in its portfolio. Cash rents on new and renewed leases (commenced in the third quarter) aggregating 0.7 million square feet and 5.1 acres of improved land grew 65.9%. The tenant retention ratio for the operating portfolio was 76.2% and 53.3% for the improved land portfolio.Shares of Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) Terreno Realty have climbed 4.5% quarter to date compared with the industry’s increase of 2.4%.

290,ebc08b0e-3ab3-300d-829b-1972536140d2,PCAR,2022-12-21,2 Stocks to Ride the Domestic Auto Industry's Strength,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2-stocks-ride-domestic-auto-133301334.html,1671543181,STORY,"['PCAR', '^GSPC', 'HOG']","[The Zacks Domestic Auto industry is seemingly showing resiliency in the face of an uncertain economic outlook, rising interest rates and stubborn inflation. Buyers’ inclination toward green cars is serving as a key catalyst. The popularity of electric vehicles (EVs) is soaring with each passing day and auto biggies are fast cementing their position in this domain. While supply chain chaos is still there, production challenges are ebbing and inventory levels are visibly improving. Meanwhile, the most pressing concern now is high borrowing costs, which are making it difficult for less-affluent and subprime consumers to find affordable vehicle payments to suit their monthly budgets. Nonetheless, the overall prospects of the industry look decent. We recommend placing your bets on two top-ranked industry participants, PACCAR PCAR and Harley-Davidson HOG, to fetch handsome gains.Industry OverviewThe Zacks Domestic Auto industry includes companies that are engaged in designing, manufacturing and retailing vehicles across the globe. These include passenger cars, crossover vehicles, sport utility vehicles, trucks, vans, motorcycles and electric vehicles. The industry — which is highly consumer cyclic and provides employment to a large number of people — is at the forefront of innovation, courtesy of its nature and the transformation that it is going through. The widespread usage of technology and rapid digitization are resulting in the fundamental restructuring of the automotive market. Several companies in the industry have engine and transmission plants and conduct research and development and testing of electric and autonomous vehicles.Key Investing ThemesRobust EV Sales: Climate change concerns, technological advancement and stringent fuel-emission standards are increasing green vehicles’ adoption by both automakers as well as customers. The demand for electric cars is off the charts and EV sales continue to break records. The year 2022 has been the biggest year for zero-emission vehicles in the United States on record. In the third quarter of 2022, U.S. EV sales continued to outpace their ICE counterparts, hitting a new record of over 200,000 units of battery-powered vehicles.Legacy automakers are going the extra mile to gain a strong foothold in this red-hot e-mobility space. The latest Inflation Reduction Act will fuel EV sales further. The EV momentum is only expected to blossom going forward.Story continuesInventory Levels Improving: With challenges associated with new-vehicle production starting to abate, we are seeing noticeable improvements in the inventory levels. Strong production levels are likely to translate to higher days’ supply and offer shoppers more vehicle options, going forward. Total US automotive inventory increased to about 1.55 million units at the end of October, up from 1.43 million units in September and the highest level since May 2021. Rising inventory and pent-up consumer demand will aid sales.Vehicle Affordability Is the New Concern: Just when new vehicles seem to be becoming more widely available, it’s to be seen if Americans wish to continue to splurge on these high-ticket items in the face of rising interest rates. To purchase the same vehicle at the same monthly payment, buyers are now forced to increase their down payment, which is resulting in new affordability challenges. With borrowing getting expensive and risks of a potential slowdown in the economy, consumers might be unwilling to pay a heavy premium for cars.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Solid ProspectsThe Zacks Automotive – Domestic industry is a 20-stock group within the broader Zacks Auto-Tires-Trucks sector. The industry currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #75, which places it in the top 30% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates encouraging near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are gaining confidence in this group’s earnings growth potential.Before we present you three industry participants worth considering for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Domestic Auto industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite and the sector over the past year. The industry has lost 53.1% compared with the S&amp;P 500 and sector’s decline of 18.7% and 47.6%, respectively, over the said time frame.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationSince automotive companies are debt-laden, it makes sense to value them based on the EV/EBITDA (Enterprise Value/ Earnings before Interest Tax Depreciation and Amortization) ratio. On the basis of the trailing 12-month enterprise value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), the industry is currently trading at 16.46X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 11.64X and the sector’s 12.21X. Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 54.42X, as low as 8.85X and at a median of 15.30X, as the chart below shows.EV/EBITDA Ratio (Past Five Years)2 Stocks to BuyPACCAR: Headquartered in Bellevue, PACCAR is one of the leading names in the trucking business with reputed brands like Kenworth, Peterbilt and DAF. The new DAF lineup comprising XF and XG models (launched in 2021) and the XD model (launched in 2022) is driving the firm’s revenues. Continued growth in the aftermarket parts — which is a high margin and a less cyclic business, thanks to the rampant adoption of its proprietary MX engine — bodes well. Accelerated efforts toward electrification, connected vehicle services and advanced driver-assistance system options are set to bolster PACCAR’s prospects. A solid balance sheet with low leverage is another tailwind.PACCAR currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a VGM Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for PACCAR’s 2022 and 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 53.4% and 4.3%, respectively. The consensus mark for PACCAR’s 2022 and 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 23.4% and 5%, respectively. Over the trailing four quarters, the stock surpassed estimates on all occasions, the average surprise being 12.6%.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Price and Consensus: PCARHarley-Davidson: Milwaukee-based Harley-Davidson is one of the leading motorcycle makers in the world. In sync with long-term growth objectives to streamline its product portfolio, HOG is focusing on motorcycle models and technologies that better align with market trends. Its Hardwire plans look to improve effectiveness and contribute to revenue growth. Per the plan, the company remains focused on bolstering its market position by emphasizing on sportier bikes and a modern marketing strategy. Building on Hardwire strategy, the company announced Hardwire Stage II in May, aiming for increased performance.Harley-Davidson currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and has a VGM Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for HOG’s 2022 and 2023 earnings implies year-over-year growth of 12.4% and 1%, respectively. The consensus mark for HOG’s 2022 and 2023 sales implies year-over-year growth of 7.5% and 3%, respectively.

A decline in shipping volumes due to weakening demand is also very concerning.However, though the economies are reopening, the urge for online shopping refuses to relent among consumers.

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.1% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.28%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 0.09%.Heading into today, shares of the credit card issuer and global payments company had lost 5.1% over the past month, lagging the Finance sector's loss of 3.85% and the S&amp;P 500's loss of 3.6% in that time.American Express will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release. The company is expected to report EPS of $2.19, up 0.46% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $14.26 billion, up 17.38% from the prior-year quarter.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $9.96 per share and revenue of $52.94 billion. These totals would mark changes of -0.6% and +24.92%, respectively, from last year.It is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for American Express. These revisions typically reflect the latest short-term business trends, which can change frequently. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank.

This represents a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 9.92.Story continuesIt is also worth noting that AXP currently has a PEG ratio of 1.23.

295,fa60138e-1ac8-3eff-93e8-25f025e86e1c,AXP,2022-12-21,"American Express Company's (NYSE:AXP) latest 7.9% decline adds to one-year losses, institutional investors may consider drastic measures",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/american-express-companys-nyse-axp-130022526.html,1671541222,STORY,['AXP'],"[Every investor in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 65% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.And institutional investors endured the highest losses after the company's share price fell by 7.9% last week. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 8.7% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell American Express which might hurt individual investors.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about American Express. See our latest analysis for American Express ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About American Express?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in American Express. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see American Express' historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. American Express is not owned by hedge funds. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 20% of shares outstanding. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 6.3% and 6.0%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 12 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of American ExpressWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of American Express Company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$126m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 14% stake in American Express. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Public Company OwnershipIt appears to us that public companies own 20% of American Express. It's hard to say for sure but this suggests they have entwined business interests. This might be a strategic stake, so it's worth watching this space for changes in ownership.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

296,ea38382a-0b11-3ffd-8344-b0d4c01a588a,MLM,2022-12-21,Martin Marietta (MLM) Sees 12.7% Six-Month Gains Amid Inflation,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/martin-marietta-mlm-sees-12-141802358.html,1671545882,STORY,['MLM'],"[Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. MLM is likely to be a solid bet for 2023 despite inflationary pressure and a slowdown in single-family residential construction. Higher public infrastructure investment and continued strength in large-scale energy, domestic manufacturing and multi-family residential projects should act as catalysts for the company’s growth.Earlier this month, Martin Marietta reported mixed financial numbers for third-quarter 2022. Earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but revenues surpassed the same. On a year-over-year basis, the metrics improved, backed by double-digit pricing growth on relatively flat organic aggregates shipments.The company’s focus on value-over-volume strategy has been driving growth as double-digit pricing growth drove record profitability in the third quarter despite relatively flat organic aggregates shipments. MLM expects a return to expanding margins in the fourth quarter of 2022 as the compounding effect of multiple pricing actions throughout the year offsets continued inflationary pressure and a slowdown in single-family residential construction.Indeed, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s margins remain vulnerable to ongoing inflationary pressure and lower aggregate volume. Owing to these headwinds, the company’s shares have gained 12.7% over the past six months compared with the industry’s 18.6% rise. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors Favoring the StockHigher Infrastructural Spending: Martin Marietta and other concrete &amp; aggregates producers are expected to benefit from strong global trends in infrastructure modernization, energy transition, national security, and a potential super-cycle in global supply-chain investments. The need to rebuild the nation’s deteriorating roads and bridges is expected to help MLM.The company expects a diverse mix of federal projects for road and bridge work, water control, harbors and ports and the power grid, which will likely drive growth in 2023. MLM sees substantial opportunities in 2023 across federally funded infrastructure projects, industrial manufacturing, energy and power. It expects to deliver another year of profitable growth, strong cash flow and attractive returns for shareholders.In the near term, it expects affordability-driven headwinds in the single-family residential end market. This will be offset by a significant acceleration in public infrastructure investment and continued strength in large-scale energy, domestic manufacturing and multi-family residential projects.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings of $15.38 per share calls for 20.5% year-over-year growth.Regular Acquisitions/Divestitures: The company has been reshaping its operations and portfolio via regular acquisitions and divestitures. On Oct 1, 2021, the company acquired Lehigh Hanson, Inc.’s West Region business (Lehigh West Region) that added 17 active aggregates quarries, two cement plants with related distribution terminals and targeted downstream operations to its portfolio.Story continuesMeanwhile, the company also reviews the overall portfolio for opportunities to maximize value by monetizing or exchanging select assets. On Aug 9, 2022, the company entered into a contract to sell the Tehachapi, CA cement plant and related distribution terminals to CalPortland for $350 million in cash.Solid Long-Term Plan: Martin Marietta has been gaining strength from long-term strategic plans — markedly SOAR (Strategic Operating Analysis and Review) 2025 initiatives — and delivered the most profitable 2021 performance in its history. It is to be noted that 2021 marked 10 years of consecutive growth in consolidated products and services revenues, adjusted gross profit, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per share.Martin Marietta has been focusing on SOAR plans that include portfolio optimization, assessing business combinations and arrangements with other companies engaged in similar businesses, increasing footprint in core businesses, investing in internal expansion projects in high-growth markets as well as pursuing new opportunities associated with the existing markets served.HeadwindsInflationary Pressures: The company uses large amounts of electricity, diesel fuel, liquid asphalt and other petroleum-based resources, subject to potential supply constraints and significant price fluctuation, which could affect operating results and profitability. The availability and pricing of these resources are subject to market forces. Variability in the supply and prices of these resources could affect the company’s operating costs, and the rising costs could erode profitability.Aggregate product gross margin again declined 170 basis points (bps) year over year during the third quarter of 2022 due to higher energy, internal freight and repairs and maintenance costs. The continued acceleration of liquid asphalt costs contributed to the gross margin compression of 360 bps, or 470 bps on an adjusted basis, in the third quarter of 2022 for the Downstream businesses.Lowered View: Owing to ongoing inflationary pressure and lower aggregate volume, MLM lowered its expectations for consolidated products and services revenues, gross profit and adjusted EBITDA for 2022. The company expects consolidated products and services revenues in the range of $5,740-$5,845 million (compared with $5,770-$5,910 million expected earlier), gross profit in the $1,445-$1,510 million band (earlier expected in the $1,500-$1,585 million range), selling, general and administrative expenses within $390-$400 million and adjusted EBITDA between $1,610 million and $1,675 million (versus $1, 670-$1,750 million expected earlier).3 Better-Ranked Construction Stocks in the LimelightSome better-ranked stocks, which warrant a look in the Construction sector, include:Headquartered in Temple, GA, Janus International Group, Inc. JBI, carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), manufactures and supplies turn-key self-storage and commercial and industrial building solutions. Solid backlog levels, an impressive project pipeline, productivity improvements and commercial actions, including pricing, are expected to drive growth. The company is expected to benefit from its one-stop-shop offering with a leading market share in self-storage doors and related design and installation services.Janus’ earnings for 2023 are expected to rise 16.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year and next-year earnings has improved to 75 cents per share and 88 cents per share from 69 cents per share and 80 cents per share, respectively, over the past 60 days.Altair Engineering ALTR — holding a Zacks Rank #2 — provides software and cloud solutions in simulation, high-performance computing, data analytics and artificial intelligence worldwide.ALTR’s expected earnings growth rate for 2023 is 21.5%.Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL — carrying a Zacks Rank #2 — provides transportation, e-infrastructure, and building solutions.STRL’s expected earnings growth rate for 2023 is 6.3%.

NTAP need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Jan 20, 2023 $35.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for NetApp shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, NetApp is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Computer- Storage Devices industry that ranks in the Top 18% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimates for the current quarter, while nine have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from $1.41 per share to $1.33 in that period.Given the way analysts feel about NetApp right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

MDLZ is committed to reshaping its portfolio to focus on areas with greater growth potential, such as its chocolate, biscuits and baked snacks categories. Moving on these lines, the company inked a deal to divest its developed-market gum business (in the United States, Canada and Europe, excluding France) to Perfetti Van Melle Group, a renowned European maker of gum and confectionery products.The deal is anticipated to conclude in the fourth quarter of 2023. It includes the sale of manufacturing facilities in Rockford, IL, and Skarbimierz, Poland, as well as the Trident, Dentyne, Stimorol, Hollywood, V6, Chiclets, Bubbaloo and Bubblicious gum brands in the United States, Canada and Europe. It also includes the sale of European candy brands — Cachou Lajaunie, Negro and La Vosgienne.Mondelez will continue to operate its gum business outside the United States, Canada and Europe, along with all its other candy brands and products. MDLZ is progressing well with its Vision 2030 strategy, which is aimed at doubling down the company’s core snacking categories. The strategy also aims at generating 90% of the company’s revenues from chocolates and biscuits (including baked snacks).Mondelez has been keen on expanding its snacking category in particular. As consumers prefer snacking over traditional meals, the company’s core categories — chocolates and biscuits — have historically depicted resilience to economic downturns and pricing actions. Consumers in developed countries consider chocolates and biscuits as affordable indulgences and one of the most-valued snacking products.What Else to Know?Apart from undertaking divestitures, Mondelez has been enhancing its business through meaningful acquisitions. In its third-quarter 2022 earnings release, the company noted that it closed the Ricolino buyout, which is expected to double the size of its Mexico business. In August 2022, it closed the buyout of Clif Bar.  Management announced incremental investments in the Cocoa Life program and expanded its target to source all cocoa volumes from Cocoa Life by 2030. Mondelez concluded the integration of Chipita S.A. business, which was acquired in January 2022 and is a major producer of sweet and salty snacks in Central and Eastern Europe. Contributions from this acquisition boosted net revenues in the third quarter.In 2021, Mondelez took over a renowned sports performance and active nutrition brand — Grenade. Further, the company acquired the Australia-based food company — Gourmet Food Holdings — which operates in the premium biscuit and cracker category.Moreover, Mondelez completed the acquisition of Hu Master Holdings, the parent company of Hu Products, on Jan 4, 2021. Earlier, the company acquired the majority interest in Give &amp; Go (in April 2020), which is a pioneer in fully finished sweet baked goods.Thus, MDLZ’s focus on refining the portfolio through prudent acquisitions and divestitures bodes well. This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s shares have rallied 10% in the past three months compared with the industry’s growth of 8%.Story continuesLooking for Consumer Staple Stocks?

All of these November-quarter results get classified as part of the 2022 Q4 earnings season tally. Total Q4 earnings for these 9 index members are down -11.2% from the same period last year on +9.8% higher revenues, with 66.7% beating EPS estimates and an equivalent proportion beating revenue estimates. This is a weaker showing relative to what we saw from this same group of 9 index members in the preceding reporting cycle. The -11.2% decline in aggregate earnings for these 9 index members compares to growth of +6.5% in 2022 Q3 while the +9.8% revenue growth in Q4 is down from +15.1% growth in 2022 Q3. The 66.7% EPS beats % for these 9 index members is unchanged from the preceding period, but up from 55.6% revenue beats % in 2022 Q3. Looking at 2022 Q4 as a whole, total earnings for the index are expected to be down -6.5% from the same period last year on +4.1% higher revenues.

Aggressive adoption of its next-generation server storage solutions by hyperscalers is expected to drive top-line growth.Broadcom expects fiscal fourth-quarter networking and server storage revenues to grow 30% and 45% on a year-over-year basis, respectively.

The company’s elevated operating expenses are hurting its bottom line. Due to the 66.4% rise in fuel expenses, operating costs increased 4.6% in the first nine months of 2022. A decline in shipping volumes due to weakening demand is also very concerning.However, though the economies are reopening, the urge for online shopping refuses to relent among consumers. High shipping rates also bode well for UPS. Moreover, its strong free cash flow generating ability pleases us and supports UPS' shareholder-friendly activities.In the first nine months of 2022, UPS generated a free cash flow of $8,472 million.

303,c42c11aa-8a61-37aa-ba21-bb902039f9fd,BSX,2022-12-21,A Lesson From a Former Know-It-All: How a Learning Mindset Fuels Global Collaboration,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lesson-former-know-learning-mindset-130500784.html,1671541500,STORY,"['BSX', 'BSX-PA']","[Stephen Morse is senior vice president and president of Asia Pacific at Boston ScientificNORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / December 20, 2022 / Early in my career, I relentlessly focused on goals over people. I was like a heat-seeking missile. Not only that, but because I was sure that I already had the right answers, I only went through the motions to collaborate with others. When other people talked, I smiled and nodded along, but I wasn't really listening. I was just waiting for my turn to speak, so I could tell them to do it my way.Boston Scientific, Tuesday, December 20, 2022, Press release pictureAs a young manager at Boston Scientific, though, I had a terrific boss who gave me a valuable piece of feedback that forever changed my thinking. I had just finished up a meeting with some sales directors about a new product launch plan. We had discussed some potential issues around inventory - and naturally, I told them exactly how I wanted it handled. Afterwards, my boss pulled me aside. He seemed amused. He told me that I reminded him of a bulldozer: all gassed-up, ignition on, ready to blow the hinges off the garage door to go get what I wanted.""People don't remember what you said, but how you made them feel,"" he told me. He added that while he appreciated my obsession with results, he also needed me to consider other important factors: What beliefs did I want people to have after talking with me? What kind of experience did I want others to have in their interactions with me?Young and brash though I was, I immediately knew my boss was right. In time, he taught me to focus less on imposing my will and more on genuine understanding to better achieve common goals. Further, he showed me how collaboration leads to better results.More trust, better collaborationDuring my Boston Scientific career of over 20 years, spent mostly in the U.S. and Asia, I have seen the proof firsthand. When collaboration is strong, it is a competitive advantage, helping us get life-changing products to patients faster, create more agile systems and processes, provide better quality and efficient service, and be more creative in developing new markets.Story continuesHowever, achieving such high levels of collaboration isn't always easy. And if you think it can be difficult collaborating with your colleagues down the hall, imagine how challenging it can be when working on a global scale. Having now lived in Asia for the past 6 years, in a culture very different from my own, I have certainly seen the challenges of building trust among colleagues divided by time zones, geography, language, perspective, and business cultures.For example, take a common culture clash I witnessed among colleagues while based in Japan. To one side of the ocean would be what I call the ""American commercial warrior"" - like my former bulldozing self - operating under the mistaken impression that he knows exactly the right answer, even in a country he can barely locate on a map. To the other side of the ocean would be his counterpart, the ""Japanese commercial samurai,"" operating with an unyielding faith in his Rolodex of relationships and knowledge of the local market, unable to see the value of good work from elsewhere. Their worldviews are opposed: One sees the world through the lens of sameness, the other notices only difference. And yet, when each is willing to risk being open to new ideas and perspectives, amazing success can follow.I've come to discover that not only is such global collaboration possible, but that no matter where you are in the world, there are reliably certain colleagues who seem to naturally bring it about. These people possess certain qualities that make teamwork come easily. Chief among those personality traits, I've noticed, is a learning mindset.The power of open-minded curiosityNatural collaborators, even those with deep wells of experience, believe they have something to learn from someone else. They are curious and open to new ideas. In conversation, they aren't simply waiting to hear themselves speak, but rather ask questions, pay attention to the answers and, crucially, incorporate any new knowledge into the framework of what they already know.In doing so, these colleagues gain almost magical abilities. They notice hidden opportunities, see around dark corners, and have an uncanny ability to avert disaster. When confronted by setbacks - as inevitably happen - they prove resilient by distilling lessons for the future. Such collaborators are invaluable to their team, trusted by peers, respected by customers, and supremely credible with leadership.One thing I've noticed about great collaborators is that you can't always spot them from a distance, because there's no fixed personality type. One colleague who immediately comes to mind, for example, is an outgoing networker who makes people feel good in her presence. Another colleague is a thoughtful, cerebral soul who draws people out with his excellent listening skills. Though they're two very different people, what they have in common is their welcoming approach to new information and experiences - making each of them wonderful collaborative partners.Unfortunately, such people can find themselves drowned out by people whose expertise leads them to presume too much and listen too little. I admit that's a category that has included me at times; I have come to realize that my own vast experience, usually an asset for problem solving, can occasionally blind me to learning opportunities. Unfortunately, dismissive attitudes lead to unsolved problems and unrealized gains. But by choosing to resist our natural instincts to push back on the new, each of us might begin to cultivate learning mindsets of our own.Beyond ceremony and into substanceAmazing things happen when high-performing individuals collaborate across geography, and in my current role leading Boston Scientific across Asia Pacific, I aim to champion such global collaboration. For our commercial model to thrive, collaborators on both sides of the ocean cannot isolate themselves from each other, but rather, must be willing to learn and listen. True collaboration gets beyond ceremony and into substance.Yes, collaboration takes effort. But take it from this former know-it-all: The payoff is worth it, especially in a complex, highly regulated, and infinitely technical industry like medical devices. Our physician customers have high standards for their vulnerable patients who need life-changing innovations, and rightly so. We serve them best when we collaborate well.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Boston Scientific on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Boston ScientificWebsite: https://www.bostonscientific.com/en-US/Home.htmlEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Boston ScientificView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/732534/A-Lesson-From-a-Former-Know-It-All-How-a-Learning-Mindset-Fuels-Global-Collaboration]"

TRDA were down 32.1% in after-market trading on Dec 19 after the company announced that it received a clinical hold notice from the FDA regarding its Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for ENTR-601-44 for the potential treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD).The regulatory body indicated they will provide an official clinical hold letter to Entrada within 30 days. Entrada plans to share additional updates pending further communications with the agency.Entrada is developing a new class of medicines, Endosomal Escape Vehicle (EEV) therapeutics, through which it is building a robust development portfolio of oligonucleotide-, antibody- and enzyme-based programs for the potential treatment of neuromuscular diseases, immunology, oncology and diseases of the central nervous system. The company’s lead oligonucleotide programs include ENTR-601-44 targeting DMD and ENTR-701 targeting myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).The clinical hold was disappointing as ENTR-601-44 is one of the lead programs of the company and will delay the development of the candidate.Shares of Entrada have jumped 16.2% in the year so far against the industry’s decline of 19.7%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEntrada’s shares surged earlier in the month after it announced a collaboration deal with biotech giant Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. VRTX. The collaboration primarily focuses on Entrada’s program for DM1, ENTR-701, which is in late-stage preclinical development.Per the terms, Vertex will pay Entrada an upfront payment of $224 million and make an equity investment of $26 million in the latter. Entrada is also eligible to receive up to $485 million for the successful achievement of certain research, development, regulatory and commercial milestones and tiered royalties on future net sales for any products that may result from this collaboration agreement.The deal with Vertex results in an immediate cash influx of $250 million and investors were upbeat about the same. This cash influx will enable the company to extend its cash runaway.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy. Economic recovery for the aerospace and defense sector gained momentum in 2022 on the back of increasing demand for air travel. As per an outlook survey by Deloitte, 88% of senior executives noted that the business outlook for the aerospace and defense industry in 2023 is “somewhat to very positive.” The reasons for their optimism included developments in new technologies and segments like advanced air mobility, evolution of business models and greater exploration of space, and the use of digital thread and smart factories. According to Fitch Ratings, the Aerospace &amp; Defense outlook is improving, and feasible demand patterns should result in growing cash flows and deleveraging capacity starting in 2023. Fitch thinks commercial aircraft manufacturers and suppliers will be beneficiaries of robust global demand for new aircraft fleets as world travel recovers to pre-pandemic levels, despite the current recessionary threats looming ahead. Fitch sees deliveries of new large commercial aircrafts increasing by over 20% as compared to 2022, resulting in greater free cash flow and financial freedom for OEMs. Production rates should remain comparatively normal during the first half of next year, but could heighten towards the end of 2023. The aerospace industry is well positioned for long-term growth as the geopolitical environment remains unstable and defense capabilities around the world are being strengthened. Some of the best aerospace stocks to invest in include Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX). Our Methodology We selected the following aerospace stocks based on positive analyst coverage, strong business fundamentals, and market visibility. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 920 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2022. The list is arranged according to the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Story continues11 Best Aerospace Stocks To BuyJirat Teparaksa/Shutterstock.comBest Aerospace Stocks To Buy11. AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 18AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, and the company designs, develops, delivers, and supports robotic systems for government agencies and businesses in the United States and internationally. The company operates through four segments – Unmanned Aircraft Systems, Tactical Missile System, Medium Unmanned Aircraft Systems, and High Altitude Pseudo-Satellite Systems. On December 7, Canaccord analyst Austin Moeller raised the price target on AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) to $106 from $105 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The analyst noted that Q3 revenues missed his estimates due to an unfeasible mix and an impact on gross margins from $4 million in amortization of intangibles but the company lifted its 2023 top-line guidance on the back of high demand for both the Puma Small UAS and the Switchblade 300 and 600 loitering munitions.According to Insider Monkey’s data, AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) was part of 18 hedge fund portfolios at the end of the third quarter of 2022, up from 10 in the prior quarter. Cathie Wood’s ARK Investment Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 750,191 shares worth $62.5 million. Like Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) is one of the best aerospace stocks to invest in. 10. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 19Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) is a Colorado-based company that designs, manufactures, and services control solutions for the aerospace and industrial markets worldwide. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD)’s Aerospace segment provides fuel pumps, metering units, actuators, air valves, specialty valves, fuel nozzles, thrust reverser actuation systems, flight deck controls, actuators, servocontrols, motors, and sensors for aircrafts. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) is one of the best aerospace stocks to invest in. On November 17, Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $0.84 and a revenue of $640 million, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.10 and $13.45 million, respectively. The company expects total net sales for fiscal 2023 to be between $2.60 billion and $2.75 billion, versus a consensus of $2.37 billion. Aerospace sales growth percentage is forecasted to be between 14%-19%. Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) expects earnings per share to be between $3.15 and $3.60. Truist analyst Michael Ciarmoli on November 18 raised the price target on Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) to $88 from $80 but kept a Hold rating on the shares. The company's Q3 revenue outperformed expectations and its FY23 guidance was better than consensus but high interest, incentive comp, weak industrial margins, and R&amp;D expense drove worse than anticipated earnings and free cash flow outlook, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s Q3 data, 19 hedge funds were long Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD), compared to 18 funds in the earlier quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 4.3 million shares worth $348 million. Here is what Carillon Eagle Small Cap Growth Fund has to say about Woodward, Inc. (NASDAQ:WWD) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Woodward (NASDAQ:WWD) develops and produces control systems and energy conversion solutions and components for the aerospace and industrial end markets. The company’s stock was a strong performer in the quarter, as the end markets it serves began recovering in the second half of 2021 from a COVID-induced slowdown. Woodward’s relatively high exposure to narrow-body commercial jets should be a positive in the near-term, as narrow-body manufacturing, along with the demand for Woodward’s aftermarket components, is seeing a quicker recovery and is a growing share of the total fleet over their wide-body counterparts. Current energy and power demand is driving growth in power generation, as well as oil, gas, and alternative fuels, which has benefited the industrial side of the business.”9. Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) was founded in 1946 and is headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut. The company develops, manufactures, and markets structural materials for use in commercial aerospace, space and defense, and industrial markets. It operates through two segments, Composite Materials and Engineered Products. Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) expects EPS for full-year 2022 of $1.12-$1.24 versus the prior guidance of $1.00-$1.24, which is still in line with the $1.23 analyst consensus, but narrowed full-year revenue guidance to $1.53 billion-$1.6 billion from $1.50 billion-$1.63 billion previously. However, the new revenue guidance is still in line with the $1.59 billion consensus.BMO Capital analyst John McNulty on November 1 maintained a Market Perform rating on Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) and lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $61 from $66. The company's Q3 results were ""more modest than expected"", but its earnings recovery from the COVID-19 lows continues to improve, the analyst told investors in a research note. According to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 21 hedge funds were long Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL), compared to 25 funds in the prior quarter. Dmitry Balyasny’s Balyasny Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 1.05 million shares worth $54.5 million. Here is what LRT Capital Management has to say about Hexcel Corporation (NYSE:HXL) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Hexcel manufactures carbon fiber composite materials with the primary end markets being aerospace and defense. The company’s stock price was hit heavily last year due to the decline in the aerospace market, but the stock is making an impressive comeback this year as the outlook for travel and aerospace demand improves. The near-term demand for lightweight, high-performance carbon fiber composites is still uncertain, but the longer-term trend is clearly very strong. As airplane manufacturers look to improve the fuel efficiency and performance of their planes, the primary way of doing this is to reduce weight. The 787, 777X and A350 are just the most recent examples of planes from Boeing and Airbus that utilize an increasing amount of carbon fiber materials in their construction. Just as is the case with Marriott, we do not view recent results as meaningful or indicative of a long-term trend, but rather a once in a century aberration due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Once Covid-19 recedes, we expect the demand for more fuel-efficient planes to return rather quickly, powering the demand for the company’s light weight carbon composites.”8. Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 28Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) was founded in 1923 and is headquartered in Providence, Rhode Island. The company operates in the aircraft, defense, industrial, and finance businesses. Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)’s Aviation segment manufactures, sells, and services business jets, turboprop and piston engine aircrafts, military trainers, and defense aircrafts. It is one of the premier aerospace stocks to invest in. On December 5, Jefferies analyst Sheila Kahyaoglu noted that the $80 billion future long-range assault aircraft program, awarded to Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT)’s Bell V-280 by the U.S. Army, could be a ""$66 billion revenue generator through 2050"", adding $11 to Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) stock's net present value. The analyst also contended that its V-280 tilt rotor is a ""structurally better aircraft"" as the decision to award the contract to Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) came despite the ""very strong"" showing from Lockheed Martin's Sikorsky team.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 28 hedge funds were long Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) at the end of the third quarter of 2022, compared to 23 funds in the prior quarter. Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson’s Adage Capital Management is the leading position holder in the company, with 3.18 million shares worth $185.7 million. 7. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is a Virginia-based aerospace and defense company. It runs through four segments – Aerospace, Marine Systems, Combat Systems, and Technologies. The Aerospace segment designs, manufactures, and sells business jets, offers aircraft maintenance and repair, charter, aircraft-on-ground support and completion, staffing, and fixed-base operator services. General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) is one of the leading aerospace stocks to invest in. On December 7, General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) declared a $1.26 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on February 10, 2023 to shareholders of record on January 20. The dividend yield on December 20 came in at 2.06%. Citi analyst Jason Gursky initiated coverage of General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) on December 8 with a Buy rating and a $298 price target. The growth outlook for the aerospace segment is optimistic, given recent order trends and a backlog level that provides earnings visibility for the next several years, the analyst wrote in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 35 hedge funds were long General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) at the end of September 2022, compared to 42 funds in the prior quarter.

Star’s Longview Asset Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 30 million shares worth $6.3 billion. Here is what Oakmark Global Fund has to say about General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) in their Q1 2021 investor letter:“The second new U.S. equity purchase was General Dynamics, a leading U.S. defense contractor and owner of the world’s premier business jet franchise (Gulfstream). We were able to purchase this high-quality and durable business at a meaningful discount to our estimate of its intrinsic value after a series of near-term concerns hurt its share price. Taking a longer term view, the company’s business jet franchise should benefit from a multi-year investment program in new, differentiated products. Also, its free cash flow conversion is set to improve materially and the company is poised to benefit from a highly visible ramp up in revenue related to next generation nuclear-powered submarines. As these positives come into clearer view, we expect sentiment to improve, along with the company’s share price.”6. The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 42The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) was incorporated in 1916 and is based in Chicago, Illinois. The company designs, develops, manufactures, sells, and supports commercial jetliners, military aircraft, satellites, missile defense, human space flight and launch systems, and related services worldwide. The company operates through four segments – Commercial Airplanes, Defense, Space &amp; Security, Global Services, and Boeing Capital. On December 16, The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) received the biggest order for commercial aircraft in history as United Airlines Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) agreed to buy 100 twin-aisle 787 Dreamliners, with an option to buy 100 more. The carrier also will buy 100 of Boeing’s 737 MAX single-aisle jets.Susquehanna analyst Charles Minervino raised the price target on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) on December 14 to $217 from $185 and kept a Positive rating on the shares. The analyst updated his model to factor in November's order and delivery data. He remains optimistic as high profile orders provide further evidence of a solid commercial aerospace demand outlook. According to Insider Monkey’s data, 42 hedge funds were bullish on The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 51 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.5 million shares worth $178.5 million. In addition to Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT), and Raytheon Technologies Corporation (NYSE:RTX), elite investors are piling into The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) for exposure to the aerospace industry. Meridian Funds made the following comment about The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“We similarly remained invested in largely out-of-favor The Boeing Company (NYSE:BA) , a global leader in developing and producing commercial jet aircraft. Due to some self-inflicted wounds and a bit of bad luck, as well as dramatic declines in air travel early in the pandemic, investor sentiment for this company has simply been awful. As part of our contrarian thinking, however, we view the business as critical to global transportation needs and see multiple catalysts to improve sentiment. In addition to the current surge in air travel worldwide, ramped up production of the 737 MAX aircraft and the pending restart of 787 Dreamliner deliveries should help turn broader sentiment. Additionally, we anticipate a meaningful inflection in cash flow as Boeing starts delivering aircraft currently in storage as well as the eventual expansion of its production in both core platforms.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy.  Suggested articles:11 Best Wine Stocks To Buy13 Best Materials Stocks To Buy11 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None. 11 Best Aerospace Stocks To Buy is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NASDAQ:INTU) may be sending very bearish signals at the moment, given that almost half of all companies in the United States have P/E ratios under 14x and even P/E's lower than 8x are not unusual. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.Intuit hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. See our latest analysis for Intuit peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on Intuit will help you uncover what's on the horizon.Is There Enough Growth For Intuit?There's an inherent assumption that a company should far outperform the market for P/E ratios like Intuit's to be considered reasonable.Taking a look back first, the company's earnings per share growth last year wasn't something to get excited about as it posted a disappointing decline of 13%. That put a dampener on the good run it was having over the longer-term as its three-year EPS growth is still a noteworthy 10% in total. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 26% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.2% per annum, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why Intuit is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.Story continuesWhat We Can Learn From Intuit's P/E?Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.As we suspected, our examination of Intuit's analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. Right now shareholders are comfortable with the P/E as they are quite confident future earnings aren't under threat. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.It's always necessary to consider the ever-present spectre of investment risk.

""Our goal is for our fleet vehicles to leave no trace of pollution behind.""SDG&amp;E is aggressively decarbonizing its fleet because transportation accounts for about 40% of California’s greenhouse gas emissions, making it the state’s single largest source of pollution. Additionally, transportation-related emissions heavily impact low-income communities located near busy roadways and industrial facilities.In response, SDG&amp;E has developed a new analytical tool called the Community Impact Platform to prioritize vehicle replacements in neighborhoods hit hardest by air pollution and climate change. The innovative technology overlays more than 80 million data points from its fleet’s daily trips with socioeconomic metrics to create a heat map of emissions in the region’s most vulnerable communities. Using advanced analytics, the platform can present various scenarios for replacing vehicles to reduce emissions and improve air quality. For example, half of the company’s eight recently acquired Ford Lightning trucks have been deployed to the Metro District, which covers homes and businesses adjacent to regional transportation hubs like the airport, port and downtown. In addition to upgrading its fleet, SDG&amp;E also tracks operating data to reduce idling and improve vehicle safety, and continuously reviews new technologies.Story continuesSDG&amp;E is also working to transform transportation beyond its own fleet. To date, it has installed more than 3,400 charging ports and is building thousands more to support medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and equipment.

A congressional source said Cruz immediately lifted his holds on those nominees after the permits were approved. The nominees included David Crane, a former chief executive of NRG Energy as under secretary for infrastructure, and Jeffrey Marootian for assistant secretary for energy efficiency and renewable energy. Cruz said the approval of export permits was a ""long overdue win"" for Texas and the United States.Many environmentalists oppose LNG development saying the world should move faster off fossil fuels and invest more in wind, solar power and geothermal energy.The Energy Department concluded in the approvals that emissions from marine transport of LNG from Costa Azul would reduce emissions between 4%-8% compared to a similar plant in the U.S. Gulf Coast, ""due to the shorter tanker travel route from Mexico to markets in Asia,"" a route that avoids the Panama Canal.

315,9b863978-dcf3-32c1-aed3-1a2cc49fda13,UNH,2022-12-21,Here's Why We Think UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) Might Deserve Your Attention Today,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-why-think-unitedhealth-group-110010147.html,1671620410,STORY,['UNH'],"[The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH), which has not only revenues, but also profits. While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group UnitedHealth Group's Earnings Per Share Are GrowingIf a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. We can see that in the last three years UnitedHealth Group grew its EPS by 14% per year. That growth rate is fairly good, assuming the company can keep it up.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. It's noted that UnitedHealth Group's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins. UnitedHealth Group maintained stable EBIT margins over the last year, all while growing revenue 13% to US$315b. That's encouraging news for the company!The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-historyIn investing, as in life, the future matters more than the past. So why not check out this free interactive visualization of UnitedHealth Group's forecast profits?Are UnitedHealth Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Since UnitedHealth Group has a market capitalisation of US$486b, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a large percentage of shares. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$1.6b. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.3% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Should You Add UnitedHealth Group To Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, UnitedHealth Group is a growing business, which is encouraging. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. That combination is very appealing. So yes, we do think the stock is worth keeping an eye on. You still need to take note of risks, for example - UnitedHealth Group has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

Because it is a market weighted index, companies with larger market capitalizations make up more of the index than smaller companies do.Considering that some tech companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange have grown into some of the largest in the world, technology accounts for a significant percentage of the index's weight.As a percentage, technology companies account for a bigger percentage of the NASDAQ index than they do for other notable indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the S&amp;P 500.While the NASDAQ is known for being technology heavy, the index also includes companies in other industries as well.Blue Chip Companies Some of the technology companies listed on the NASDAQ and some of the companies in other industries listed on the index have done well over time given their strong businesses.With competitive advantages and growth, some of those leading businesses listed on the NASDAQ have increased their earnings per share significantly and the stock prices of those companies have done well in the long run.20222022 has been a challenging year for the market as the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates seven times to fight inflation. Although inflation has been lower than expected in October and November, many analysts expect the U.S. central bank to continue to raise rates further next year. As a result, many economists think there could be a recession next year.Given the headwinds, the NASDAQ index has declined over 33% year to date while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has retreated slightly over 10% and the S&amp;P 500 has fallen over 20%.Story continuesWith the decline, some quality companies listed on the NASDAQ are arguably trading below their intrinsic values in the long term. If economic data fails to meet expectations, however, they could still decline further in the near term.Given the uncertainty, it could be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Copyright: buschmen / 123RF Stock PhotoMethodologyFor our list of 15 Best NASDAQ Stocks to Buy Now, we picked 15 stocks with competitive advantages that are listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange.We ranked the stocks based on the number of hedge funds in our database that owned shares of the same stock at the end of the third quarter.For those of you interested, also check out 11 Cheap NASDAQ Stocks to Buy.15 Best NASDAQ Stocks to Buy Now15.

After taking the recent loss into consideration, the US$2.4m worth of stock they bought is now worth US$2.9m, indicating that their investment yielded a positive return.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Macerich Macerich Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when President &amp; Director Edward Coppola bought US$525k worth of shares at a price of US$8.75 per share. Even though the purchase was made at a significantly lower price than the recent price (US$11.63), we still think insider buying is a positive. While it does suggest insiders consider the stock undervalued at lower prices, this transaction doesn't tell us much about what they think of current prices.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 251.72k shares worth US$2.4m. But they sold 4.00k shares for US$43k. In total, Macerich insiders bought more than they sold over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below!insider-trading-volumeMacerich is not the only stock that insiders are buying. For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Macerich Insiders Bought Stock RecentlyThere has been significantly more insider buying, than selling, at Macerich, over the last three months. In total, four insiders bought US$604k worth of shares in that time. But Senior VP &amp; Chief Accounting Officer Christopher Zecchini sold shares worth US$25k. The buying outweighs the selling, which suggests that insiders may believe the company will do well in the future.Story continuesDoes Macerich Boast High Insider Ownership?Looking at the total insider shareholdings in a company can help to inform your view of whether they are well aligned with common shareholders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 0.5% of Macerich shares, worth about US$14m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.So What Do The Macerich Insider Transactions Indicate?It is good to see recent purchasing. We also take confidence from the longer term picture of insider transactions. But we don't feel the same about the fact the company is making losses. When combined with notable insider ownership, these factors suggest Macerich insiders are well aligned, and that they may think the share price is too low. So while it's helpful to know what insiders are doing in terms of buying or selling, it's also helpful to know the risks that a particular company is facing. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Macerich you should be aware of, and 1 of these doesn't sit too well with us.Of course Macerich may not be the best stock to buy.

Will it be clear skies ahead, or is turbulence still in the cards for 2023? We have Stephanie Trent, who is the Citi research analyst, here to discuss. Great to have you here with us this morning.When you think about the holiday travel that we're seeing and the demand, even coming into this holiday travel season, that airline executives are continuing to point out and say this is either the golden age of travel or that demand is extremely strong, how far does that continue to hold true if we continue to see consumers pull back on some of their discretionary spending?STEPHEN TRENT: Well, appreciate the time, and thanks very much for having me on. So I do think that this ongoing demand has some legs. You still have a lot of pent-up demand out there from people that have not been able to get out over the last two years. So one of the consequences of what seems to be happening in the economy is perhaps a shift from a lot of consumption of stay from home, work from home pandemic era-type items that were very popular to, quote unquote, ""reopening.""And it sounds stale to say reopening because we've been open, but you have that ongoing shift from goods to services, and you have a dearth of airline capacity per capita that's supporting pricing. So we think that there's still revenue headwind out there over the next couple of quarters.- Well, Stephen, to that point, I mean, man, these stocks have not done well. Considering how much we keep talking about how the travel industry is booming, American down 30% this year, Alaska, Delta down 15%. Why haven't these stocks done better, and what can we expect from them going into 2023?Story continuesSTEPHEN TRENT: Sure, great question. So it has been a tough year overall. So as you said, Alaska is down this year. The S&amp;P is down a little more. So the broad market has not been easy. We spent a lot of time this year with investors going risk off. We started with Omicron, then we went to a fuel spike, and now we're dealing with higher interest rates.With all of that, we have seen earnings return. We've seen some carriers out there, such as Delta, telegraphing that they will generate multibillion-dollar levels of free cash flow over the coming years. So I would say there is at least somewhat of a disconnect at the moment between what kind of numbers these companies are putting up and price action in the market. But certainly, the market itself hasn't done great. So you actually have seen some carriers do a little better than the market itself even though they're also down.- Stephen, you have a buy rating on United. And United recently made some headlines with a giant order of some new Boeing airplanes. How do you think those new planes will transform their profits looking out over the next decade?STEPHEN TRENT: Sure. So I have to be-- maybe I can give you an industry answer on that one. What we've seen across the big three is a need to modernize their fleets, a need to update their aircraft, so moving away from the sub-120 seat range into these larger-gauge aircraft that have really good seat across profiles versus the smaller ones.So in terms of what that potentially means from the earnings perspective, I think, is the relevant thing to focus on now, certainly when you get big orders come in. And I'm speaking generally here. Definitely, there can be some concerns around capex and how a particular airline is going to fund a fleet upgrade. But these fleet upgrades can really make a big difference in terms of economic performance and fuel efficiency. So I think that's the more relevant piece of the pie longer term, even though short term, yes, elements of the market could have a knee-jerk reaction to what happens with capex.- Do you believe that that will drive more of these partnerships, more of these alliances? And we also do have a short clip from the Mesa Airlines CEO off of their most recent alliance. And this is just one of many. But let's roll the clip real quick, and then we'll come back to it on the other side.JONATHAN ORNSTEIN: When we first wanted to set up a meeting to talk about a wind-down, they said, don't even bother coming to Dallas. We don't want to talk about a wind-down. In fact, not only did they try to incentivize us, they offered us an extension of the contract. So I just have a problem with that because it really denigrates the hard work of all my people. And the bottom line is we went to them because we were losing so much, like $5 million a month, and just said, look, we need to get out so that we can continue to operate the business and provide jobs for 3,500 people.- OK. And so do you believe that, given what you were mentioning a moment ago in the capex scrutiny, that there could be-- if there were just additional planes purchased, that we'll see more of the partnerships like Mesa and United, and even like we had seen in the northeast alliance between American Airlines and JetBlue?STEPHEN TRENT: Yeah, so I think that we are in a transition period at the moment. So I think there are cyclical things that have been associated with the COVID pandemic, and then I also think there are some structural things. So speaking of the latter, for example, over a long term, regional, I would argue, has been having a tougher time for a while.The market's continuing to move to mainline. Airlines, for years, have been moving to larger-gauge aircraft. And we've seen, for example, all of the major aircraft manufacturers respond to that. All of the newer versions of planes that come out, virtually all have more seats on them.So I think in terms of alliances and what could get agreed to or what airlines could agree to going forward, absolutely, I think we are going to see out-of-the-box-type opportunities to form alliances that will not necessarily be within any particular existing global alliance like Star or Oneworld. So absolutely, I think there's a chance we see more of this because of those structural items that I mentioned.- If we are indeed-- and a question on capacity here, I suppose-- if we are indeed headed into a recession that's going to dampen the amount of travelers or the propensity for leisure travel and even see some cutback on corporate travel, which is already trying to rebound to the best extent possible right now, what does that mean for the need for capacity to actually be restored to pre-pandemic levels?STEPHEN TRENT: Yeah, absolutely. So what we've actually seen in some of our recent survey work has been a little bit of softness in domestic managed business travel. So I think part of that is, yes, coming from interest rates going higher. Some of that is coming from Zoom and TelePresence supplanting some in-person meetings that would have been done on a pre-pandemic level.And then I think you also now have blended business travel. So one of the structural items, for example, is a lot of people are no longer in the office five days a week. So maybe they're doing three days live and two days remote. That creates more flexibility around what we could see in terms of blended trips now, people traveling for business/personal reasons as opposed to a pure business trip.In terms of capacity coming back and what could happen on the pandemic level-- excuse me-- I'm sorry-- on the economic level with rates going up and maybe some slowdown, a whole bunch of pieces to that. So one of the things-- that the other things that we're seeing, for example, is international momentum, in several instances, is actually overtaking the booking curve momentum we see in the US market. So those network carriers with very good international exposure, very good transatlantic exposure like Delta, for example, probably going to continue seeing revenue tailwinds as some of these international corridors appear to be six to nine months behind the United States domestic in terms of their recovery.The other thing high level that we would be thinking about is if we are indeed going into an economic slowdown, what are the implications for oil prices? So they have come off a bit. Jet fuel kerosene has come off a little less than oil prices, for example, but they've still come down. So I think the confluence of those factors and some continued shift away from goods and into services is not necessarily a bad setup for the network majors.- Great analysis for us here today. Citi analyst Stephen Trent, good to see you. Happy holidays.STEPHEN TRENT: You too. Thank you.]"

Unfortunately, these high risk investments often have little probability of ever paying off, and many investors pay a price to learn their lesson. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Eaton (NYSE:ETN). While profit isn't the sole metric that should be considered when investing, it's worth recognising businesses that can consistently produce it. View our latest analysis for Eaton Eaton's Improving ProfitsEven when EPS earnings per share (EPS) growth is unexceptional, company value can be created if this rate is sustained each year. So it's no surprise that some investors are more inclined to invest in profitable businesses. Eaton boosted its trailing twelve month EPS from US$5.19 to US$5.76, in the last year. There's little doubt shareholders would be happy with that 11% gain.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. EBIT margins for Eaton remained fairly unchanged over the last year, however the company should be pleased to report its revenue growth for the period of 3.3% to US$20b. That's encouraging news for the company!The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyYou don't drive with your eyes on the rear-view mirror, so you might be more interested in this free report showing analyst forecasts for Eaton's future profits.Are Eaton Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Owing to the size of Eaton, we wouldn't expect insiders to hold a significant proportion of the company. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$206m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.3% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Story continuesIs Eaton Worth Keeping An Eye On?As previously touched on, Eaton is a growing business, which is encouraging. If that's not enough on its own, there is also the rather notable levels of insider ownership. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. What about risks? Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Eaton   you should know about.Although Eaton certainly looks good, it may appeal to more investors if insiders were buying up shares.

For more companies, head on over to 5 Biggest Hardware Companies in the World. The home improvement, or hardware market, is a simple industry. Companies sell a variety of furnishings such as doors, tables, kitchenware, locks, handles and more through retailers and consumers who either own their homes or have rented them out make the purchases over time due to regular wear and tear. Since the sector is tied directly to housing, its value also lies in the billions of dollars with a rather stable market that remains relatively insulated from economic downturns when compared to high growth industries such as consumer technology.A research report from BlueWeave Consulting and Research estimates that the home improvement market was worth $337 billion in 2021, and it will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.4% to sit at $514 billion by the end of 2028. Growth in the sector will be fueled by rising incomes and living standards all over the globe, especially as more individuals move to cities and/or start owning properties. Out of the various subsegments in the home improvement market, such as interior and exterior improvements, disaster repairs, and room additions, the exterior improvement segment is the largest component of the hardware industry since a property's exterior is the one that is exposed the most to harsh outdoor environments. North American and European countries are the largest players in the home improvement market, as their high disposable income allows consumers to make larger and more expensive purchases.Another report, this time from Brand Essence Research, shares that the global home improvement sector was worth a whopping $798 billion in 2021, and from then until 2028 it will grow at a CAGR of 4.6% to sit at an estimated $1 billion - making it one of the most lucrative industries in the world. This research firm segregates the market into spending from generations, as it estimates that Baby Boomers will account for 56% of all the spending in 2025, which is unsurprising since the costs of buying a home have increased meteorically which has made it even harder for Generation X and Millennials to buy their own homes.Story continuesSome top hardware companies on our list are The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), The Lowe's Companies, Inc. (NYSE:LOW), and The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW).jelleke-vanooteghem-MohB4LCIPyM-unsplashOur Methodology The hardware industry is divided primarily into two subsegments as far as the end consumer is concerned. These are the retailers who sell hardware products and the companies that supply them. We have covered the largest players in both these industries, with roughly one third of the firms being the suppliers.

They help residents keep their home plumbing safe, while also supporting our team in the field. Many times, when pipes freeze, customers will assume there is an issue with their water service and call our team to inspect. This can stretch the resources of team members who are working hard in the field to keep water flowing and keeping safety front of mind.""If in-home pipes freeze, customers should:Shut off the water immediately and not attempt to thaw frozen pipes unless the water is shut off. Freezing can often cause unseen cracks in pipes or joints.Apply heat to the frozen pipe by warming the air around it. Use a hair dryer, space heater or hot water. Space heaters should not be left unattended. Avoid using kerosene heaters or open flames.Once pipes thaw, water should be turned on slowly and pipes should be checked for cracks and leaks.When customers are away from home, they should:Have someone regularly check their property to ensure the heat is working and the pipes have not frozen.Consider a freeze alarm. The alarm will call a user-selected phone number if the inside temperature drops below 45 degrees.Other tips:Residents should keep snow cleared away from fire hydrants located near their residence. This can help local firefighters in the event of an emergency.Direct customers of Illinois American Water should keep account contact information updated to receive important information if their water service is impacted.

Through the project PFAS One Water Risk Communication Messaging for Water Sector Professionals, American Water and The Water Research Foundation (WRF) have released two PFAS communication toolkits for use by water systems as they interact with customers, regulators, and other stakeholders.This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20221220005031/en/""We’re excited to join with American Water and other partners in the release of these new PFAS communication toolkits as part of our broad PFAS research portfolio. There has never been a more important time for water professionals to communicate clearly about the presence of PFAS in the environment,"" said Peter Grevatt, Chief Executive Officer of WRF.Workshops, stakeholder engagement, and message testing were used to develop the toolkits. The first toolkit, focused on the concept of One Water, presents information describing where PFAS come from and how they enter the environment and impact drinking water and wastewater systems. The toolkit materials can be used to educate the public about the many products that contain PFAS and how they contribute to the routes of exposure to these compounds. Content was developed for utility use on websites, bill inserts, social media, brochures, and other communications platforms.A second toolkit was developed for use in conjunction with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s fifth Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Rule (UCMR5), which requires sampling for 29 individual PFAS. This toolkit includes an instructional ""How To"" manual that helps water systems to design their own frequently asked questions (FAQs) documents to share with customers and stakeholders. The FAQs can also be used as the basis for other communication materials, including talking points for frontline employees, public information officers, and utility leaders. Every water system faces unique circumstances related to PFAS management and regulatory requirements; therefore, water systems can use the toolkit materials to refine their messaging by incorporating their specific system informationStory continues""As an industry leader, American Water is proud of its participation in The Water Research Foundation’s efforts to engage with other industry experts to understand and better explain PFAS and its presence in the environment,"" said Cheryl Norton, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer at American Water. ""We’re confident that the assets developed by the entire team that delivered the toolkits for UCMR5 and One Water will assist our water and wastewater colleagues to accurately inform and educate their customers about PFAS.""The materials in these toolkits are customizable by water systems and encompass a variety of outreach methods. Use of the toolkit materials can reinforce the utility/customer relationship and enhance water systems’ roles as sources of accurate information and environmental stewards for communities around the globe.""Water quality and the safety of our customers and communities are a top priority at American Water. We are proud to have taken a leadership role, in collaboration with The Water Research Foundation, to develop educational messaging regarding PFAS that will position water and wastewater systems to be the trusted sources of truth for the communities they serve,"" added Lynda DiMenna, Chief Environmental and Safety Officer at American Water.This project was funded by WRF and the American Water Works Association, and the research team was comprised of communications and technical experts from American Water, Hazen and Sawyer, and CDM Smith.To learn more about the project, visit the WRF project webpage.

In its third-quarter letter, the fund mentioned that in the 11 years since its launch but excluding takeovers, it has made just four complete sales. Far from splitting seconds, its since-inception turnover averages at under 4% per annum, giving an implied holding period of over 25 years. Try to spare some time to check the fund’s top 5 holdings for you to have an idea about their best stock picks this 2022.In its Q3 2022 investor letter, Lindsell Train mentioned PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) and explained its insights for the company. Founded in 1965, PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) is a Harrison, New York-based multinational food, snack, and beverage corporation with a $249.8 billion market capitalization. PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) delivered a 4.39% return since the beginning of the year, while its 12-month returns are up by 7.04%. The stock closed at $181.34 per share on December 19, 2022.Here is what Lindsell Train has to say about PepsiCo, Inc. (NYSE:PEP) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""At this point, it may help to give a further example of these self-reinforcing moats to illustrate the idea, drawing from the consumer franchises side of our portfolio. In our view, strong consumer brands can similarly exhibit Lindycompatible anti-ageing properties. Consider, that the longer a company invests in its brands through advertising and R&amp;D, the stronger and more resonant they may get. When successful, a self-sustaining feedback loop is established, whereby it becomes ever harder to recreate a heritage-rich brand from scratch, raising barriers to entry, and proportionately increasing its likely lifespan. There are plenty of long-lived portfolio franchises I could reference here, but I’ve gone with PepsiCo (NYSE:PEP); partly because we have good time-series stats on it (beware data bias!) but also, as I hope will become evident, because Pepsi over its 129 years has succeeded in creating some wonderfully deep moats.With Pepsi Cola you get the flagship soft drinks brand, which is both global and generational, but you also get the Frito-Lay salty snacks portfolio assembled alongside it, claiming nearly 40% of the global market. That’s ten-times greater than the nearest competitor and likely higher than the next 65 competitors combined. These are exceptionally strong global bands with market shares to match; the long-term empirical result being Pepsi’s dividend record which over the past 66 years (as far back as we’ve been able to go) has compounded at an annualised rate of 10%. Pepsi is no ‘in at the ground floor’ start-up today, but it wasn’t six decades ago either. Early growth investor Philip Fisher put it well when in 1958 (two years into Pepsi’s current winning streak) he wrote of “companies which in spite of outstanding prospects of major further growth are so financially strong, with roots going so deep into the economic soil, that they qualify under the general classification of ‘institutional stocks’”. PepsiCo fits this description well..."" (Click here to see the full text)Story continuesPepsi, softdrinksja-san-miguel-xYSp0kkIUio-unsplashOur calculations show that PepsiCo, Inc.

Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. With that in mind, the ROCE of PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for PepsiCo:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$13b ÷ (US$94b - US$26b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).So, PepsiCo has an ROCE of 18%.  In absolute terms, that's a satisfactory return, but compared to the Beverage industry average of 14% it's much better. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for PepsiCo compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering PepsiCo here  for free.What The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell UsThe trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. Over the past five years, ROCE has remained relatively flat at around 18% and the business has deployed 23% more capital into its operations. Since 18% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.The Key TakeawayTo sum it up, PepsiCo has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.Story continuesIf you'd like to know about the risks facing PepsiCo, we've discovered 3 warning signs that you should be aware of.If you want to search for solid companies with great earnings, check out this free list of companies with good balance sheets and impressive returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

(NASDAQ:REGN) has fallen by 3.5% over the past week , insiders who sold US$7.0m worth of stock over the past year have had less luck. The average selling price of US$620 is still lower than the current share price, or in other words, insiders would have been better off holding on to their shares.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Regeneron PharmaceuticalsIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Independent Director, Arthur Ryan, sold US$4.3m worth of shares at a price of US$622 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even below the current price of US$721. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal.

PMS serves more than 9,000 patients with diabetes across New Mexico. Of those patients, one-third are not adequately managing their conditions, and are therefore at risk of developing life-threatening complications.With Q4HE's support, PMS is implementing the New Mexico Diabetes Prevention Action Plan, a comprehensive plan to provide intervention and support services for individuals living with diabetes. The Action Plan's certified diabetes educators provide counseling for tribal and other community members newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes as well as for existing patients with uncontrolled diabetes. Follow-up services are provided in person, over the phone, and virtually to better monitor patients, address questions, and ensure medication compliance. This can include regular screenings for blood pressure, BMI, and general health to monitor HbA1c levels and make referrals for additional treatment if necessary. Additionally, PMS provides supplies including home-monitoring glucometers to enable patients to monitor and report their glucose levels more regularly.Preventive services are crucial to help patients manage their health before conditions like diabetes develop, so PMS also provides counseling and educational resources for individuals with prediabetic symptoms.""Adult diabetes tends to be highest among Native Americans and Hispanics across our service area, and early diagnosis, education, and continuing chronic care follow-up are key factors in reducing this health disparity. The number of uncontrolled diabetes patients has also increased in the past year partly due to reduced clinic visits and lifestyle changes caused by COVID. By partnering with Quest for Health Equity, PMS can expand access to diabetes education programs and home monitoring systems. This will create pathways for consistent health education and awareness, resulting in healthy habits and long-term positive impacts in underserved populations.""Story continuesLisa Stephens Grants and Contracts Manager, Presbyterian Medical ServicesRead MoreQuest Diagnostics , Tuesday, December 20, 2022, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Quest Diagnostics on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Quest Diagnostics Website: http://www.questdiagnostics.comEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Quest DiagnosticsView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/732600/Preventing-Diabetes-and-Improving-Health-Outcomes-Across-New-Mexico]"
