For starters, the Federal Reserve is likely done raising interest rates. Second, companies that built up inventories through 2021 and 2022 are done getting rid of them, a concept known as ""de-stocking.""', '""We\'re coming out of that, which should actually clean the plate or the table for everything to perform much better next year,” Dunn said.', 'As a result, he says investors may find growth opportunities in the following four sectors:', 'Real estate', 'The S&P 500 Real Estate ETF (XLRE) is flat for the year.

For the third quarter, we drove strong performance led by the strength of our 2 global iconic brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. And our disciplined execution of brand building growth plan, the PVH+ Plan.Despite an increasingly choppy macro backdrop, particularly in Europe, we grew overall revenue in line with guidance, up 4% on a reported basis and up 1% in constant currency, while expanding our gross margins, and we beat our guidance for the bottom line. We drove high single-digit growth in our direct-to-consumer business with growth across both brands in all regions. This included double-digit growth in our owned and operated e-commerce and mid-single-digit growth in our stores.Partially offsetting the strength in B2C trends, we experienced incrementally more challenging trends in wholesale brought by the tougher macro environment. As a company, we are driving a much more profitable business. On a non-GAAP basis, in Q3, we grew EBIT by 13% versus last year with strong margin expansion. And in Q4, we project to grow EBIT by over 30% versus last year, with an approximate 12% EBIT margin. Looking ahead, we are reaffirming our EBIT margin, and we are increasing our EPS guidance by $0.10 for the full year on a non-GAAP basis.By focusing on what's within our control for the full year 2023, we remain well positioned to buy meaningful margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth. We just came out of the important Thanksgiving and Black Friday week, one of the key consumer moments during the holiday period. And I'm pleased to share that in both North America and in Europe, we beat our growth plans versus last year and delivered a strong start of the holiday season. We continue to make strong progress and gain increasing traction across all 5 growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan. And we relentlessly lean into the execution on winning with product, winning with consumer engagement, winning in the marketplace, as well as developing a data and demand-driven supply chain and investing in growth while driving efficiencies.And as I mentioned on our last call, each of our growth drivers plays an important role. And it's when we play them all together, that's something really powerful happens. And let me share some concrete examples on how we made that come to life this quarter. First, our strong D2C growth was fueled by increased product and supply chain strength that drove higher gross margins. The sales growth was supported by a nearly 20% increase in marketing investments with strong cut-through campaigns and global talent amplification. From a regional perspective, we drove constant currency revenue growth for our combined Calvin and Tommy businesses for all regions.Our outperformance in the quarter was driven by North America, which is a very important proof point for how we are already positioning both Calvin and Tommy for long-term sustainable growth in the region through strong execution of the PVH+ Plan. For the second consecutive quarter, our EBIT margin for our Calvin and Tommy businesses in North America together took a sizable step forward and expanded to 13.1% in the quarter, with significant gross margin expansion in both our direct-to-consumer and wholesale business.Inventory continues to be in great shape, both in composition and in levels, down 19% at the end of the quarter, as we made significant progress increasing overall inventory productivity as part of our actions to lower inventory in relation to sales by 25% by the end of fiscal 2024, all while improving availability. For the first half of 2024, we also see decreases in our AUC with more than 5%. This is partly driven by favorable macro but even more importantly, it's driven by an improved approach to our costing process, the first results of a better raw material strategy and early returns on a much sharper assortment productivity.We continue to invest in growth while driving cost efficiencies and are improving our cash flow, increasing share buybacks, showing our confidence in our ability to execute over the long term. During the quarter, we further sharpened our focus on our 2 core brands with the divestiture of Heritage Brands. The proceeds from the transaction will be used to repurchase stock and we now expect to repurchase approximately $550 million of our stock, up from $400 million previously.Finally, it will be the strength of our brands, our consistency in direction and our relentless execution of the PVH+ Plan that will set us apart over time. And this will, in turn, be driven by the quality of the management team, which we have strengthened significantly over the past year. I'm happy to share the addition of Lea Rytz Goldman, who will join us as Global Brand President of Tommy Hilfiger in spring 2024. Lea is a uniquely strong and experienced brand and business builder with an outstanding track record building brands globally. Under Lea's leadership, the Tommy Hilfiger brand will operate in the same way our global Calvin Klein business operates today under Eva Serrano, creating a consistent and unified global brand structure. Each of our 2 brands now has one leader who sets the vision, leads product creation, brand marketing and consumer experience globally, working closely with our regional teams who inform those strategies and lead the brand to win in the marketplace.Now let me share a bit more of what drove our performance in the quarter, both from a global brand and regional perspective. Starting with Calvin Klein. Throughout the third quarter, Calvin continued to focus on driving very strong consumer engagement globally through our most important hero products and driving a strong category offers with growth across our refined performance in underwear categories. It was another quarter where we delivered cut-through campaigns globally and continue to amplify our talent partnerships. When we last spoke, the brand has just launched its fall campaign, which included our long-term ambassadors, Jennie Kim, Jung Kook, Kendall Jenner, wearing our most essential underwear, denim and refined women's wear styles. Cut through with nearly 4 million average video views on TikTok and over 20% engagement rate on Instagram.As part of the fall campaign, the brand also launched a surprise performance with Jung Kook in Times Square New York. The concept was announced only 30 minutes beforehand and tens of thousands of fans gathered within minutes. Jung Kook and his whole crew were dressed in iconic Calvin Klein, and their looks were immediately shoppable on our side. It was a perfect example on how we amplify global talent to win with consumer engagement.For holiday, the brand campaign features Hailey Bieber in iconic Calvin Klein stars, where our hero products are prominently featured on social through shoppable content to drive commercial impact.Finally, I'm excited about the progress we are making to align Calvin Klein to one global brand vision. Since joining, Eva has been focused on tapping into Calvin's core DNA to make the brand more current than ever. As part of this work, we are expanding the capabilities of our global product teams here in New York, to drive a more unified product vision across key categories to win serving all markets.Let me now share a few examples from Tommy Hilfiger. This fall, the Tommy brand reinforced its core DNA. Going back to Classic American Cool and iconic Tommy Lifestyle through our family-focused seasonal campaign. As part of this campaign with a special focus on Asia, we celebrated the K-Pop band Stray Kids' VMA win with a warm welcome to the Tommy family, breaking our record of social media engagement in the first 30 minutes. When we connect the brand in authentic ways with global talent like this, our fans respond, and we expand our reach and influence.We combined another culturally relevant moment with aspirational talent when Tommy campaign star SZA, hosted a New York Fashion Week brunch with over 100 VIP guests and influencers generating over 800 million impressions on social. And just 2 weeks ago, at the Las Vegas Formula One Grand Prix, we expanded our partnership with Formula One by welcoming one of Hollywood's biggest rising stars, Damson Idris, to the Tommy Hilfiger brand family as our newest men's ambassador. Together with Damson, Tommy hosted a number of events with key influencers featuring day and night Tommy looks.For the holiday, our Tommy campaign celebrates the happiness of returning home, families and friends are captured in Tommy's Classic American Prep with the twist as they unite to celebrate the season, all amplified by very strong talent.Now let me turn to our regional performance. I'd like to start with North America, which is a big proof point for us this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we made significant progress building the foundation for sustainable, increasingly profitable brand accretive growth for the region, and I'm very encouraged by the major initial traction we are gaining. Our Tommy and Calvin businesses together delivered high-quality, low single-digit revenue growth and most importantly, a 13.1% EBIT margin in the quarter, including higher gross margins and higher AURs. We drove outperformance for both our direct-to-consumer businesses and our wholesale business, which showed meaningful sequential improvement, and this is with still a big part of the pre-pandemic tourism, not yet back.Let me share a few highlights. For Tommy, our D2C growth continues to be driven by our best premium Style Essentials, which increased by over 50% compared to last year, supported by elevated in-store execution. For Calvin, leading with our category offense, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the refined category, the expanded Essentials focus was also once again a standout, supported by an integrated marketing campaign and elevated execution on ck.com.Across both brands, we drove another quarter of double-digit growth in our owned and operated e-commerce businesses. This was driven by the elevation of our brands through stronger storytelling improved site merchandising and new conversion tools. Within wholesale, while our partners remain conservative we continue to see strong gains resulting from our efforts to build a much stronger business with our key partners such as Macy's. Let me share some examples.We drove double-digit year-over-year growth in Tommy test stores, where we have invested together with Macy's in stronger field team coverage. And we are driving double-digit AUR growth at Macy's through the ongoing success with our improved product assortment, including our Polo offense and seasonal categories. For Calvin, our men's Essentials business increased over 50% at Macy's with investments in the right premium essential base assortment. We also saw strength in refined categories, which grew 25%. I'm very proud of our North American team's execution this past quarter, and we now have the team, the plan and the disciplined execution in place to unlock our full potential in the region.Turning to Europe. We continue to drive growth this quarter, building on our historically large business, market-leading awareness and overall brand strength in the region. In the third quarter, we delivered high single-digit revenue growth on a reported basis and low single-digit growth in euros against a record-breaking quarter last year. Our revenue exceeded EUR 1 billion, led by mid-single-digit growth in D2C for each brand. In wholesale, we confirmed our pre-spring Spring '24 order book at low single-digit growth on a constant currency basis with pre-spring already shipping in Q3, leading to timing differences versus Q4 last year.Like others, we have seen a more challenging macroeconomic backdrop in Europe, and that is impacting consumer confidence and the wholesale channel. Additionally, this quarter, just as we were about to kick off the fall season, we saw the longest streak of record-setting warm weather in Europe since the 1800s. Both factors have driven an increasingly promotional environment in the marketplace. And for us, the heat wave in September was a double whammy, given our historical strength in outerwear, sweaters and heavyweight nets.Weather aside, going forward, we anticipate this challenging macro backdrop and an increasingly cautious wholesale channel to continue into 2024. In this environment, we are not sitting still. We are leveraging our market-leading strength and driving much increased profitability and proactively adjusting how we operate. We're taking our PVH+ Plan execution to the next level, and we are doing this in 2 main ways.First, against the current macro backdrop in the wholesale channel, we feel that it's critically important to avoid having too much inventory in the market. Even if that means less selling in to secure strong sellout with high margin and less discounting. Our main priority independent of macro for both brands will always be to strengthen our position for long-term sustainable brand accretive growth.Second, we will lean into the next level of PVH+ execution through DTC and with our key wholesale partners, leveraging our key strengths in product, consumer engagement and marketplace management. I'll highlight a few examples of how you will see this in action. Across both brands, we have product innovation coming for 2024. In technical fabrics, dress casual, more choice of our best premium essentials, more transitional products to become less weather dependent and all while we continue to cut the unproductive assortment tail.In consumer engagement, we just shot very strong cut-through campaigns for both Tommy and Calvin that we'll launch for Spring 2024. And in the marketplace, you will see us continue to invest in our stores, shop-in-shops and digital experiences to keep elevating the consumer experience.You can already see the positive effects of our next level PVH+ execution in our D2C channels, where we have more control between product and consumer and can execute with impact more quickly. And in wholesale, thanks to the much improved inventory management this season, despite the tougher conditions, you will already in Q4 be able to see a significantly improved profitability versus the same quarter last year.I have personally spent more time in Europe over the past few months. I visited over 50 stores in 6 countries to work with our teams as we adjust to market conditions and put the next level of PVH+ execution into action. Standing out the most from this work is the foundational strength we have in both brands with consumers across the region and the opportunity to continue leveraging this as we navigate the current environment.Moving on to Asia Pacific. We continue to drive strong performance, which included double-digit constant currency growth in our direct-to-consumer businesses across the region, including China. We continue to win in key consumer moments such as Chinese Valentine's Day and Tmall membership day, fueled by strong hero products and successful capsule launches. And both Calvin and Tommy continue to move up to rankers on Tmall.Most recently, we delivered double-digit growth in GMV during China's important 11-11 activation. Leading with a product category offers, we focused on growing live stream sales and leveraging talent in innovative and engaging ways. We also captured market share on Douyin as consumers increase spending on these newer formats of shopping. We leveraged our global mega talent to expand brand awareness in the region. In October, Calvin celebrated fall 2023 collection in Tokyo, featuring brand ambassador Jung Kook, the ventral strong brand awareness across the region and globally. And Tommy's fall campaign reached a total fan base of over 130 million with regionally relevant ambassadors, including K-pop group Stray Kids, in addition to new ambassadors, Li Qin and Greg Hsu, who drove over 430 million impressions in China alone during the campaign period.Overall, we are doing a great job executing the PVH+ Plan in the region, and we are very optimistic of the long-term growth opportunity for both of our brands.In closing, I feel very good about the strong performance we delivered in the quarter and how we keep gaining traction through our brand-building PVH+ execution.Before I turn the call over to Zac, I would like to thank all of our associates around the world for their hard work and important contributions this year. And I wish everyone a happy and healthy holiday season."", 'Zachary James Coughlin', ""Thanks, Stefan, and good morning. My comments are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. As Stefan discussed, we are pleased with our results for the quarter, driven by our iconic brands and disciplined execution of the PVH+ Plan. We continue to build on our track record of performance, delivering our top line guidance while exceeding bottom line guidance as we compete to win in this highly dynamic global environment.We delivered revenue growth of 4% on a reported basis and 1% on a constant currency basis, in line with our guidance with significant strength in DTC and in spite of an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment, especially in Europe. On the bottom line, we once again exceeded our earnings guidance with earnings per share of $2.90, driven by strong expense management. We delivered operating margin of 10.5% for the quarter, up 90 basis points versus last year, delivering on our commitment of sequential second half improvement.Also, importantly, our inventory at quarter end is down 19% compared to last year as we continue to proactively manage our inventory levels. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to end the year with inventory significantly lower than last year, with improvement to continue through 2024 as we make progress on our previously announced goal of a 25% reduction in inventory as a percentage of sales.We also completed the sale of our Heritage Brands intimate apparel business earlier this week for $160 million in cash, which was yet another important step as we accelerate our focus on our core global brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. We plan to utilize approximately $150 million of net proceeds from the sale for share repurchases in 2023. This increases our planned share buybacks for the year to approximately $550 million compared to up to $400 million previously. We expect the sale to be slightly accretive to our operating margin in 2024. As we head into the fourth quarter, we see continued strength in our DTC business and also expect pressure in the wholesale business to continue. This is especially true in Europe as the macro environment continues to be challenging, exacerbated by record high temperatures in September, as Stefan discussed, causing retailers to take a cautious approach. This as well as the impact from the sale of our Heritage Brands intimate apparel business is reflected in our revised revenue outlook of 1% growth for the year on both a reported and constant currency basis. Our prior guidance was an increase of 3% to 4% as reported and 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis.On the bottom line, we are reaffirming our approximately 10% operating margin outlook and raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook for the year to a record high $10.45 compared to $10.35 previously, despite our lower revenue outlook, as we further strengthen our focus on driving profitable sales and disciplined cost management.I will now discuss third quarter results in more detail and then move on to our outlook. Revenue was up 4% for the quarter, which reflected a 3% positive impact from exchange. Third quarter revenue for our international businesses was up 1% on a constant currency basis. Revenue in our European business was up 1% in euros despite the increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment with mid-single-digit growth in the DTC business, partially offset by pressures in wholesale and an unseasonably warm start to the fall season. Revenues for Asia Pacific were up 1% on a constant currency and down 2% on a reported basis. Strong demand across the region drove low double-digit constant currency growth in the DTC business, which was largely offset by timing of wholesale shipments compared to last year.In North America, revenue for our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brand businesses combined grew 2% as we delivered another quarter of growth in both our retail stores and owned and operated e-commerce business with total DTC up low single digits. Our owned and operated e-commerce sales were up double digits for both brands again this quarter as the investments we have made in the platform and overall site experience continue to resonate with consumers.Wholesale sales for our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brand businesses combined in North America were also up low single digits. Although retailers continue to take a cautious approach, retail sales trends improved sequentially compared to the second quarter, particularly at Macy's as we focus on driving sell-through and healthy inventory across the channel. Importantly, our quality of sales is improving significantly in North America as we grow that business. Gross margins were up over 500 basis points with increases across both brands and all channels.Looking at our overall third quarter revenue from a channel perspective, we continue to drive strong performance across all regions in our direct-to-consumer business. Our total DTC revenue was up 6% on a constant currency basis and up 8% on a reported basis in the quarter and up approximately 150 basis points as a percentage of our total revenue compared to last year. We delivered another quarter of strong growth in both our stores and our owned and operated e-commerce business with constant currency revenues up 4% and 12%, respectively, compared to last year.Total wholesale revenue was down 3% on a constant currency basis for the reasons I previously outlined. On a reported basis, wholesale revenue was up 1%. Our Global Brands delivered another solid quarter with Calvin Klein revenues up 6% and Tommy Hilfiger revenues up 4% as reported. On a constant currency basis, revenue for Calvin Klein was up 3%, and Tommy Hilfiger was flat as macroeconomic challenges impacting Europe weigh more heavily on the Tommy business. Importantly, our DTC business was up in both brands and in all regions.In the third quarter, we delivered gross margin of 56.7%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to last year despite a 100 basis point negative impact to product costs due to exchange. Gross margin reflects a significant favorable shift in mix with our higher gross margin DTC and international businesses making up a larger portion of total revenue and a favorable impact from lower ocean freight rates compared to last year.SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue for the third quarter was better than planned at 46.2% and flat versus the prior year. We continue to take a disciplined approach to managing expenses while making targeted investments to drive the PVH+ Plan, including a nearly 20% increase in marketing compared to last year to fund cut through brand campaigns. These investments and the impact of the shift in mix to our DTC and international businesses were offset by an approximately 150 basis point improvement in expenses versus last year due to savings realized from the actions we have taken to reduce people costs and prudent management of expenses. In total, EBIT for the quarter was $249 million, exceeding our expectations. Operating margin was 10.5% and expanded 90 basis points compared to last year despite the 100 basis point negative impact of exchange on our gross margin. And importantly, our operating margin for the quarter reflects a significant improvement in our North America business to 13.1% for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein combined.Earnings per share increased 12% to $2.90 compared to $2.60 in last year's third quarter and exceeded our guidance by $0.20, driven by the improvement in EBIT. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 22%.And now moving on to our outlook. Starting with the fourth quarter. We are projecting fourth quarter revenue to decline 3% to 4% compared to last year on both a reported and constant currency basis with projected strong high single-digit growth in our direct-to-consumer businesses more than offset by a decline in wholesale revenue, including the revenue reduction from the sale of the Heritage Brands intimate apparel business. Excluding the sale, the decline in wholesale revenue is mostly in Europe, where the wholesale revenues are projected to be down approximately 15% versus last year. Approximately 2/3 of that decrease is due to onetime shipment timing differences compared to last year when supply chains were still normalizing and about 1/3 is due to a decrease in sales to lower-margin accounts as we remain focused on quality of sales. Looking forward, as Stefan mentioned, we do expect the tough macros to continue into 2024.As a result, and combined with our continued focus on quality of sales, we now expect lower sell-in for wholesale next year with a higher quality sell-through. The benefit to the fourth quarter from the 53rd week in 2023 to our overall revenue is mostly offset by the revenue reduction from the sale of the Heritage Brands' intimate apparel business.While fourth quarter revenue is projected to be lower than last year, importantly, profitability is expected to be significantly higher. EBIT is expected to increase over 30% compared to last year, and operating margin is expected to expand to approximately 12%, up nearly 350 basis points compared to last year. And importantly, Europe profit has planned up significantly as well with regional margin up over 500 basis points versus last year and close to all-time highs.The overall increase in operating margin is almost entirely due to an approximately 400 basis point improvement in gross margin. The improvement is comprised of an approximately 150 basis point benefit due to a favorable shift in channel and regional mix, approximately 125 basis point improvement in freight expense and approximately 125 basis point improvement due to the raw material costs for spring '24 product being significantly lower. We expect all of these impacts to carry forward beyond the end of 2023.We also expect a modest increase in SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter compared to last year, with the higher expenses of DTC, mostly offset by the significant efficiencies we're driving in spending. Our fourth quarter earnings per share is projected to be approximately $3.45, up approximately 45% compared to $2.38 in the prior year, driven almost entirely by higher EBIT due to the significant profitability improvement. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter is estimated at approximately 22% and interest expense is projected to be approximately $25 million.And now bringing that all together for the full year 2023. As I mentioned, we are updating our full year revenue outlook and now project revenue to increase by approximately 1% on both a reported and constant currency basis. We are reaffirming our operating margin guidance for the year of approximately 10% and raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.10 to approximately $10.45, up 16% compared to 2022 and a record high for PVH. Regionally, our full year revenue outlook for North America for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein combined is unchanged. But our overall outlook for the region is now planned down mid-single digits compared to down low single digits previously, due entirely to the impact from the sale of the Heritage Brands' intimate apparel business. Our outlook for Asia Pacific on a constant currency basis is also unchanged, planned up mid-teens. While on a reported basis, our revenue outlook for Asia Pacific has been negatively impacted by exchange, with growth on a reported basis now planned up high single digits compared to up low teens previously. In Europe, we are now planning full year revenue approximately flat in euros compared last year. This compares to our prior guidance of up low single digits in euros. Our DTC business in Europe continued to be planned up mid-single digits, but is mostly offset by a decrease in wholesale versus last year given the macroeconomic challenges I mentioned earlier. On a reported basis, Europe was planned up low single digits compared to up mid-single digits previously.We continue to expect our full year gross margin rate to increase over 100 basis points compared to 2022, despite approximately 100 basis points of higher cost due to exchange. As we've indicated previously, the improvement in our gross margin reflects an approximately 100 basis point benefit from a favorable shift in mix and approximately 100 basis points of improvement due to lower freight costs.We also continue to expect that SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue for the full year will increase approximately 70 basis points compared to 2022 with our investments in DTC and mix of international business driving higher expenses. Additionally, as I've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to invest in key areas that drive growth, including increased marketing with our full year target continuing to be approximately 6% of revenue. These impacts are partially offset by cost efficiencies, primarily due to the people cost actions we have taken. As a reminder, in the third quarter, we completed our targeted 10% people cost reduction with annual savings ahead of our targeted $100 million of savings.Our full year operating margin projection continues to be approximately 10% and continues to reflect high single-digit EBIT growth. Interest expense is projected to be approximately $93 million versus approximately $100 million previously, and we continue to expect our tax rate will be approximately 22%.Before we open up for questions, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with our third quarter results. We continue to work relentlessly to drive results. And as Stefan talked about earlier, we are laser-focused on delivering our commitments by executing the 5 key growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan, bringing together the consumer-facing value drivers of product, consumer engagement and marketplace with our underlying operating engines to deliver consistent results in a systematic and repeatable way.And with that, operator, we would like to open it up to questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.', 'Robert Scott Drbul', 'Great progress in North America this quarter, especially around the profitability. Can you just walk us through how we should think about the trajectory of North America going forward?', 'Stefan Larsson', ""Thank you, Bob. Yes, North America was really the standout this quarter. And it's really the results coming from the PVH+ focus we put forward over a year ago and the team coming into place and really building the brands and driving the business to win more with the domestic consumer. So you see the strength in products. So the category offense and the hero products is working. And you see it in gross margin rate going up, pricing power going up. Tommy, as an example, the best essentials, the premium essentials is up 50% versus last year. Calvin, fall essentials, much more, much better essentials in the line, much better sell-through much higher AUR. So you see product strength continue to cut through and really resonate well with the consumer. And you will continue to see sequential improvements on that.Consumer engagement when it comes to both Calvin and Tommy, the cut-through campaigns with the relevant talent amplification is really working. So you see the improved product amplified by strong talent and the strong cut-through campaigns, whether it's Jung Kook, Hailey Bieber, Kendall Jenner, Lewis Hamilton, George Russell, SZA, Damson Idris. We're starting to consistently execute on the PVH+ growth driver in terms of strengthening products, strengthening consumer engagement.And then it's the marketplace and execution. So really well done by the team indeed to see both stores and e-commerce, much stronger executed. You will see the consumer experience elevated. And then as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our focus on getting closer to our best wholesale partners is really yielding strong results. So Macy's is a great example, where we are working very closely in -- to start with test stores where we execute a stronger products, the better essentials, the better newness, better presentation. We co-fund more staffing and see the results is very, very strong and very encouraging. So looking at the results in North America and then how it trickles down to 13.1% operating margin, it just reinforces what we knew when we set out a PVH+ Plan is that when we lean into the iconic strength of these 2 beloved brands, Calvin and Tommy, and we execute in what Zac was just mentioning, systematic and repeatable way, then it really pays off. So you will see this continuously -- growth in North America, both in D2C and in wholesale."", 'Zachary James Coughlin', ""Yes. And I think -- Bob, it's a great question. We're really proud of North America. North America EBIT margin of 13%. That's up 800 basis points versus last year. And what's exciting is it's really all elements of the business. Revenue was up with significant improvement in DTC. Gross margin was a big driver, up 600 basis points with better inventory, improved assortments and the beginnings of some of those macros turning to tailwinds. And SG&A percent also down as the work on head count efficiency is taking shape. So a great quarter.Looking forward, we'll work through the normal quarter-to-quarter profit fluctuations, but we do expect full year profitability this year for North America to land into the high single-digit operating margin range with a much better second half than first half. And so we think we -- this shows a clear path to the low teens for a full year that we committed by 2025 in the PVH+ Plan."", 'Stefan Larsson', ""And this -- just to build on what Zac was saying here, this is on top of quite a tough macro in North America as well. So we see that we're able to tap into the strength of the brands and the consumer love for the brands by the better product engagement and marketplace execution despite the tough macro. So very encouraged by that, most recently by the strength in the start of the holiday. So Black Friday, which has now become Black Friday week, Thanksgiving week -- weeks we delivered stronger start than planned for both Calvin and Tommy in North America."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI.', 'Michael Charles Binetti', ""Congrats on the next quarter and a really tough macro. Stefan, I want to ask you a little bit more specifically about some of the initiatives David Savman is putting in on the ground as he's working on supply chain and inventory maybe within the context of the 25% reduction in the inventory to sales ratio that you talked about that's going to keep going for the next 5 quarters, I think. What are some of the examples of work that he's doing that's really starting to land already? And then Zac, the 12% operating margin in fourth quarter, that's very, very different. I think the margins in the fourth quarter have been high single digits in the past. So you're way above that. It seems like a new level. How should we think about margins after '23 through the lens of what looks like a step change in the business in the fourth quarter?And maybe you could frame the 15% margin target you spoke about for 2025 at the Analyst Day. I know you joined the company maybe 20 minutes before that target went out. So now you had some time to think about it, maybe we can get some perspective on it."", 'Stefan Larsson', ""All right. Thanks, Michael. Let's start with the first question on the progress of the demand-driven supply chain. And seeing what David has been able to do with his team in a very short period of time is really encouraging. So what's happening?So you know that last quarter, we set out the long-term target by end of 2024 to drive down inventory in relation to sales with 25%. While improving availability, that's a key part. And what we see already now is inventory in great shape, probably the best shape we have ever had it, minus 18% versus last year with improved availability. So if we start on how that is possible. Much better, much more focused planning upfront, the assortment planning. So I keep speaking about the demand-driven supply chain based on my experience, always starts with supply chain coming in upfront with the product teams, better assortment planning upfront. And there, we are just starting to leverage that.But that is part of why we can run minus 18% in inventory with better availability. What you also see is that AUC is coming down. So if we look at the first half of 2024, AUC will come down with more than 5%. And this is not just sitting there writing the macros. The macros are favorable. On top of that, we're driving significant improvement, with improved raw material management. So we get better fabric, more competitive fabric, higher quality for the consumer at a lower cost.Better costing process, better discipline in the costing process, more data-driven. We have a better and more sharp assortment productivity. So we -- given that we build the assortment now with a very strong intent of starting with the best must-have essentials, we should always have Calvin and Tommy through to their DNAs. Each of their DNAs, the best must-have essentials in the market. That's what we are working. So we've build assortment from that, then we make sure we have the appropriate newness and then we can continue to cut the unproductive assortment tail.So what you see is really a multitude of efforts that are starting to gain traction. But it's been faster than what we expected. And you will see us just continue to deliver sequential improvements."", 'Zachary James Coughlin', ""Yes. And Michael, on the 4Q operating margin, we're expecting around 12% operating margin for the quarter compared to 8.6% last year, like you said, sort of high single digits. That's up, let's just say, 350 basis points, just to give us some composition of that. 125 basis points of that is really the full realization of the freight improvements, both rate and because of great availability, lower reliance on air freight. So that sort of booked. 125 basis points is tied to improvements in product costs. And I think as Stefan said, one, yes, macros are moving from negative to positive as raw materials are coming down. But also David Savman and the team are consistently now beating macros, and that will be trends that carry forward into '24 as well.And the last major driver of that is really the full impact, about 125 basis points of the headcount reductions we've taken on SG&A. So as we look forward into 2024, obviously, we're not providing guidance there. But I think you can look at the composition of that gross margin improvement, those are all factors that are now in place, either structurally or from an external marketplace perspective. And so we do expect to see those to carry forward fully into 2024.And to your question on the targets, as I stood on the stage shorter to Stefan on the leadership team, those are my commitments as well as anyone else. And I think that we've talked about the 15% being that bar that we're going to set for ourselves regardless of what's happening in the macro environment. I think this 12% for the third -- for the fourth quarter is a clear view of that because as Stefan to talk about, there's some choppy macros now and still driving to that. And we expect to continue to drive that through to 2024 as well as that next step towards the 2025 targets."", 'Stefan Larsson', ""Yes. And coming back, Michael, one more thing when it comes to the inventory, better inventory, demand-driven supply chain, what I see happening that I want to share as well is that having Eva Serrano come in and build the strength in the global product engine in Calvin, and now Lea Rytz Goldman coming in for Tommy, both highly experienced brand builders and very strong in product, you have that David Savman and his team's work upfront with them on leveraging that strength in products. So it's the connection between the increased strength we are driving in our 2 global brands, with the supply chain expertise that David brings in, plus the regional execution.So we are putting -- the supply chain is at the core, working with the global brands and the regions. And that's -- when you see -- again, it feels like Eva has been here for a long time, but she has only been here since the first half of this year. And you can see the spring assortment 2024 slightly improved by -- slightly affected by you will see improvements coming in by Eva fall much more improvement and then it just keeps going from there. So I'm very pleased by seeing how the team is coming together and breaking this old-school sequential handover way of working and breaking it down and starting up front working together cross-functionally. And that's whether it's the early days of building H&M or the Old Navy turnaround or the repositioning of RAP, that's always when I've seen that happening, that's where the value over time will increase."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.', 'Matthew Robert Boss', 'So tow-part question. Stefan, could you just elaborate on underlying demand trends for Tommy and Calvin in Europe? Maybe if we parse through some of this near-term noise, which sounds like it was weather related? And then for Zac, just maybe on sensitivity, could you just help lay out given all of the self-help drivers and the uncertain backdrop from a revenue perspective? Could you see operating margin expansion next year in a scenario of maybe flat revenues? Or just what would that picture look like?', 'Stefan Larsson', ""Yes. Thanks, Matt. Let me start. So if we look at Europe and the underlying demand trends for Calvin and Tommy is still being strong. Look at Q3 -- so when we look at Q3, we continue to grow on a record quarter in Europe last year, low single-digit growth on a record quarter last year. And that growth was on a very strong base. So 25% up versus pre-pandemic. And then you see another to the demand growth in Europe is the strong D2C growth despite a tough macro. And then what happened in the macro was in September, we had the warmest start of the fall since the -- no, 1800 -- 1880 or something like that. So of course, impacting September. We came back and the market came back in October from a demand trend perspective, but driving -- given the importance of September, an increasingly promotional environment in the market. And we see over the Q3, we see an increasingly cautious macro backdrop in Europe and with the biggest impact on the wholesale channel.So what we are doing there, we're not sitting still. We are leaning into the PVH+ execution in 2 ways -- 2 main ways. First, with a macro, my experience is when the macro gets tougher, it's really important to focus on quality of sales. So we are increasing the focus on quality of sales, even to Zac's point, if that means selling less in to the wholesale channel, but securing a strong sell-out margin, and avoiding too much inventory in the market. So that's the first action we take.The second is really leaning into the next level of PVH+ execution. PVH+ execution makes a big difference, independently on macro, but especially in tough macro. So a few examples I gave in terms of the product strength that we are driving in 2024, product innovation, whether it's technical components, fabrics, whether it's more choice of our premium essentials, more transitional products. We see that. It seems like every season now seems to start with an unusual weather situation. We can -- we can sit back and say, okay, or we lean in the way we do, which is say, okay, clear. We have to do more transitional products. And that you will see already in 2024.Then in consumer engagement, having in a tough macro having market-leading brands, is a huge advantage. And the way we take advantage of that consumer engagement wise is twofold, just shot 2 very strong marketing campaigns for spring 2024, with mega talent amplifying the improved product strength. So -- and then in the marketplace, what's also going to be important is to continue to invest in the consumer experience. So you will see that in investment in our stores, investments in shop-in-shop in the digital experience. So overall, we are in a tough macro in Europe leveraging better the strength, the market-leading strength we have for Tommy in particularly in Europe, and then we have the strength of having one of the biggest growth brands in Europe in Calvin."", 'Zachary James Coughlin', ""Yes. And I think just to add some color to Stefan's comments about just how disruptive the September heat wave was in Europe, we can look at our own DTC sales. We don't typically provide intra-quarter numbers, but I think it's really important context. Coming out of summer, our August DTC revenue was up 10% in Europe. Then the heat wave hit in September, right as us and all of our competitors were setting fall season and sales were down 7% in September. Then in October, things have recovered to being up 10%, but in a significantly more promotional environment. So in our DTC channels, we can move more quickly. The economics of our wholesalers more difficult. And so we see that coming through with regard to a more cautious sell-in outlook that they're putting into place, and we're preparing for that potential to carry forward in 2024. But I think what's important is that readiness shows up in profitability.Even with a lower European revenue outlook for 4Q, we expect European profit to be up over 30% versus last year in the fourth quarter. So I think that ability to manage profitability moving into 2024 remains full. I think to answer your question on 2024 around managing operating margin in a potential flat environment, absolutely. Our commitment is to deliver on our operating margin commitments regardless of where the top line is. And I think we can look no further than 4Q for our success in doing that right now, and we'd expect for that success to carry forward into the to 2024 as well."", 'Stefan Larsson', ""And just building on what Zac was saying here because across the world in all our regions in a tough macro, we have the strength of having in Calvin and Tommy, two of the most iconic beloved brands in the marketplace. And we have the brand building plan in PVH+ and we gain increased traction when we lean into the PVH+ execution. So from that, you will see continuously that what's within our control, we will continue to improve step by step by step. And the margin is the most in our control. That's why you hear the confidence from Zac."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Jay Sole with UBS.', 'Jay Daniel Sole', ""Stefan, I wanted to follow up on your comments about the success you're seeing at Macy's. If you can connect that to the transition that's ongoing with G-III, does it -- the success you're seeing makes you -- give you the confidence that you're building the teams and the capabilities to be able to replace those revenues that G-III currently has within PVH as the transition continues and continue to build a big business and really capture all that opportunity that's out there financially as that transition takes place?"", 'Stefan Larsson', ""Thank you, Jay. Great question. Yes, very encouraged by the progress we are seeing with Macy's. And this is also building on my experience being part of repositioning Ralph for sustainable growth. A number of years back, we did exactly the same thing. We partnered with Macy's and made sure that Macy's became our best full price expression, and that's what we are doing. And we are doing it in our own-controlled men's and underwear today and both Calvin and Tommy, and it's really working out. And it's the same confidence we have when it comes to taking back the licenses over the multiyear period with G-III. We are already working on making sure that the product strength -- the category offense is there, the product strength is there and the pricing is there. So yes, equally confident when it comes to men's and women's and the strength of Calvin and Tommy with the Macy's consumer. We are early on in doing a very deep consumer and brand study globally. But when we start to break that down into North America and in Macy's, we see the incredible strength that both Calvin and have -- Calvin and Tommy has with the Macy's consumer.So an incredible awareness in very strong consideration and very strong brand love. So we have all the pieces in place from the consumer love for our brands and putting all the pieces in place for successfully taking back the licenses. So very encouraged."", 'Operator', 'And that question will come from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.', 'Dana Lauren Telsey', ""Nice to see the progress. Just continuing on the thought of the wholesale business, which is so important in the progress that you've made in America, as you mentioned with Macy's, during this time period in Europe where the macro is more a little bit more challenging. Are there relationship enhancements or business enhancements that are being done on the wholesale side in Europe that can mirror North America? And are there partners like Macy's that you see as dominant in Europe is what you see here in North America? Just can put some color on the wholesale in Europe and that potential."", 'Stefan Larsson', ""Thank you, Dana. It's also an important question. So we have market-leading strength in Europe and very strong partnership with the strongest wholesale retailers. And when I look back at the past few months, when I referenced seeing 50 -- over 50 stores and doors in 5, 6 countries also met with key partners like Peak & Cloppenburg, Zalando. So very much focused on the same thing, next-level PVH+ execution.So to your point, there is the strength in the brands and the consumer love is unprecedented for us in Europe. And then the strength when we lean into essentials and we build out choices of our best essentials must-haves in the market when we have the right newness when we have the right cut-through campaigns, when we partner with our wholesalers to amplify that with the strength in products, strength and talent and strength that the retailers have, it's very encouraging.So overall -- thank you, Dana. So overall, thank you very much for joining our call today. As you can hear from us, we feel very strong about the increased traction we get on the PVH+ Plan. We recognize the tough macro we are navigating. We also recognize the strength that we have in our hands with these 2 very strong brands. The plan and the execution strength that comes out of that plan that we are just in the beginning of tapping into. So looking forward to catching up next quarter on the progress that we will be relentless in driving. And then ahead of that, I just wish everybody a really happy holiday. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""This does conclude today's PVH Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.""]"

So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$156. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.', 'Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Walmart shares, than buying.

Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. It's great to see that Walmart insiders own 0.9% of the company, worth about US$3.8b. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders."", ""Insiders sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. But since Walmart is profitable and growing, we're not too worried by this. While insiders do own a lot of shares in the company (which is good), our analysis of their transactions doesn't make us feel confident about the company.

With a sprawling network of over 10,000 stores globally and serving approximately 240 million customers each week, Walmart continues to dominate the retail landscape. The financial tables from the recent filing reveal a company that has adeptly navigated the retail sector's challenges. For the three months ended October 31, 2023, Walmart reported net sales of $159.4 billion, a significant increase from $151.5 billion in the same period last year. The nine-month figures also reflect growth, with net sales rising from $443.1 billion in 2022 to $470.7 billion in 2023. Despite the economic headwinds, Walmart's strategic focus on operational efficiency and customer-centric low pricing continues to drive robust store traffic and product turnover, cementing its position as a retail powerhouse."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with WMT.', ""Market Dominance and Brand Power: Walmart's strength lies in its unparalleled market presence and brand recognition. As the largest retailer globally, Walmart benefits from economies of scale that enable competitive pricing and a vast distribution network. The company's brand is synonymous with value for money, attracting a broad customer base and fostering loyalty. With over $420 billion in domestic sales and a significant international footprint, Walmart's brand strength is a formidable asset in the retail sector."", ""Financial Resilience: Walmart's financial health is robust, with a strong balance sheet reflecting its operational efficiency. The company's ability to generate substantial revenue and maintain profitability, even during economic downturns, underscores its financial resilience. The latest SEC filing indicates a consolidated net income of $453 million for the three months ended October 31, 2023, despite the challenging macroeconomic environment. This resilience positions Walmart well to invest in growth opportunities and weather potential market disruptions."", ""Dependence on Physical Footprint: Despite its e-commerce growth, Walmart's business model remains heavily reliant on its physical stores. This dependence could be a weakness as consumer preferences shift increasingly towards online shopping. The costs associated with maintaining a large network of stores, including real estate, staffing, and upkeep, could strain Walmart's resources and limit its agility in responding to market changes."", ""Margin Pressures: Walmart's commitment to low pricing, while a strength in driving sales volume, also results in thin profit margins. The company's latest quarterly filing shows operating income of $6.2 billion, which, while substantial, indicates the pressure on margins given the massive scale of net sales. In an inflationary environment, where costs are rising, maintaining these low prices without eroding margins is a significant challenge for Walmart."", ""E-commerce Expansion: Walmart's e-commerce segment presents a significant growth opportunity. The company has already made strides in this area, with e-commerce sales contributing positively to comparable sales for the three and nine months ended October 31, 2023. By further enhancing its online presence and omnichannel capabilities, Walmart can capture a larger share of the growing online retail market and meet evolving consumer demands."", ""International Growth: Walmart's international operations, which generated $100 billion in sales, offer a pathway for expansion. Emerging markets present untapped potential for Walmart to grow its global footprint. Strategic investments in these regions, coupled with localized offerings, could drive future revenue growth and diversify Walmart's income streams."", 'Competitive Landscape: The retail industry is fiercely competitive, with numerous players vying for market share. Walmart faces competition from both traditional brick-and-mortar retailers and e-commerce giants. The company must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its competitive edge, which requires significant investment and may impact profitability.', ""Global Economic Pressures: Walmart's operations are subject to global economic conditions, including inflation, currency fluctuations, and geopolitical tensions. These factors can affect consumer spending, supply chain efficiency, and overall business performance. The recent SEC filing acknowledges these challenges, emphasizing the need for Walmart to remain vigilant and responsive to external economic pressures."", 'In conclusion, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) exhibits a strong competitive position with its extensive market reach, brand recognition, and financial stability. However, the company must navigate weaknesses such as its reliance on physical stores and margin pressures. Opportunities in e-commerce and international markets are ripe for exploitation, but Walmart must also be mindful of the threats posed by a competitive retail landscape and global economic uncertainties. By leveraging its strengths and addressing its weaknesses, Walmart can capitalize on opportunities and mitigate threats, ensuring its continued success in the dynamic retail sector.', 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

We will also look at the latest trends in the healthcare industry. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Countries That Have The Best Doctors in the World.\xa0', ""Rooted in a humanitarian ethos, healthcare work is often equated with selfless dedication to reducing suffering in the world; therefore, healthcare professionals' jobs continue to be one of the most respected professions in the world. However, globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) has estimated a shortage of 4.3 million physicians, nurses, and other health workers worldwide] especially in many developing countries. To read more about shortages, check countries that need doctors in 2023.\xa0"", 'Despite being a difficult job with severe shortages, doctors have one of the highest salaries in the world. It is also worth mentioning that Patrick Soon Shiong is the richest doctor in the world.\xa0', ""Owing to the physician shortages, major retailers like Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA), and CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) are capitalizing on new state laws, offering expanded healthcare services typically found in doctor's offices. Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT)’s pharmacists in 12 states now provide testing and treatment for strep throat, flu, and COVID-19. Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (NASDAQ:WBA) plans to offer a similar service across 13 states, while CVS Health Corp (NYSE:CVS) pharmacists, in 10 states, evaluate symptoms and prescribe flu antivirals and cough suppressants, excluding tests. This expansion is facilitated by recent state laws allowing pharmacists to treat minor ailments, with 44 bills becoming law in 2022. Speaking of pharmacists, check out our article about the highest paying countries for pharmacists.\xa0"", ""However, the push for broader pharmacist roles faces resistance. The American Medical Association argues pharmacists lack the necessary education and training, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services don't currently recognize them as providers for the services offered by these retailers. While legislative efforts may change this, out-of-pocket costs for services at Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT), such as a $70 assessment and tests costing between $59 and $88, raise questions about affordability and accessibility for consumers.\xa0"", 'It is worth mentioning that Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) is also one of the best retail stocks to buy now.\xa0', ""While we know AI has been revolutionizing several industries, AI’s ability to automate medical documentation has recently been a groundbreaking development in natural language processing for the healthcare sector. Researchers from NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and the University of Florida have developed an AI tool that mimics doctors' notes with the name of GatorTronGPT. In a proof-of-concept study, physicians struggled to distinguish notes written by human professionals from those generated by GatorTronGPT, accurately identifying the true writer only 49% of the time. The model is based on the GPT-3 architecture and has gained popularity with over 430,000 downloads on Hugging Face. GatorTronGPT's training involved extensive datasets that combined health-related records from two million patients and 82 billion medical terms. However, despite the exceptional potential of AI in healthcare, doctors will continue to have jobs artificial intelligence can never replace.\xa0"", 'Speaking of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), it is worth mentioning that the company has made major contributions to healthcare through the launch of the MONAI cloud APIs. This hosted cloud service facilitates the development of medical imaging AI. Announced at the RSNA meeting, these APIs enable developers and platform providers to integrate AI into medical imaging solutions using pre-trained models and workflows. The MONAI cloud APIs feature interactive annotation powered by the VISTA-3D foundation model that enhance AI model performance over time through continuous learning. Additionally, Auto3DSeg automates hyperparameter tuning for 3D segmentation tasks.\xa0', ""By collaborating with Genentech, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) has also transformed drug discovery through artificial intelligence. By optimizing Genentech's proprietary algorithms with the aid of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s DGX Cloud and BioNeMo platform, the collaboration aims to accelerate the identification of potential drug molecules, ultimately expediting the development of new therapeutics. Moreover, NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)’s BlueField-3 SuperNIC represents a leap forward in AI cloud computing. With 400Gb/s network connectivity for GPU-to-GPU communication, this technology ensures peak efficiency in AI workloads.\xa0"", ""On the other hand, Teladoc Health Inc (NYSE:TDOC) has announced an expanded collaboration with Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) to address the looming healthcare workforce crisis. By integrating Microsoft Azure OpenAI Service, Azure Cognitive Services, and Nuance Dragon Ambient eXperience (DAX) into the Teladoc Health Inc (NYSE:TDOC)’s Solo platform, the companies aim to automate clinical documentation during virtual exams. This was done in response to the US Department of Health and Human Services' prediction of a nationwide shortage of 90,000 physicians by 2025, exacerbated by burnout linked to electronic paperwork. According to the American Medical Association, physicians currently spend two hours on administrative tasks for every hour of patient care. The integrated solutions aim to alleviate administrative burdens, allowing clinicians to focus more on patient care."", 'Nuance DAX will automatically document patient encounters, enhancing the quality of shared medical information. The collaboration also includes using Nuance DAX Express, a workflow-integrated, AI-powered clinical documentation application, leveraging the latest and most capable AI model, GPT4.

Speaking about today’s chips, Ghazi calls them “so complicated” and that Synopsys has “a number of AI offerings” to meet these needs.', 'When it comes to headwinds, Ghazi says that enterprise spending has softened and that he senses that softness will continue into 2024.', 'For more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.', 'JULIE HYMAN: The last time when we spoke, you talked a little bit about the growing demand for AI, which I know played a role once again this quarter, led to revenue growth for you guys, led to that forecast going forward amidst just overall greater chip demand. But I wanted to start by drilling down into that AI demand a little bit last time we talked, it was about 10% of your revenue. Where does it stand now? And what more visibility do you have on its trajectory?', ""SASSINE GHAZI: Yeah. So if you look at the overall demand for AI, it's still in an early stage of adoption. From a-- if you look at the hyperscalers, for example, they're all trying to figure out how do they invest in their own AI chips in order to support their specific workloads, specific applications. And of course, companies like Nvidia, they have plenty of runway in terms of shortage in supply and a significant demand for their chips, with many other companies like AMD and other trying to fill that significant demand opportunity for all the various applications."", ""JULIE HYMAN: And also, even since the end of the last quarter, you guys introduced a new product in cooperation with Microsoft that is AI-focused. What are you hearing from your clients in terms of that product and the broader suite of services you're offering?"", ""SASSINE GHAZI: So today's modern chips that they go into a car or a data center or your PC, et cetera, are so complicated, that getting the task done without having some sort of an AI support-- and the support, I mean optimizing the chip, getting time to market, reducing the effort required in order to get to the results that our customers are shooting for their product spec. And this is where we come in. We have number of AI offering that goes with our product in order for our customers to deliver to their customer and product innovation."", 'JULIE HYMAN: One of the things you all talked about on the call, and it sounds like demand is still quite strong. Your backlog is still quite strong. But you did talk about a couple of headwinds. One of them was China, which I want to get to in a minute. But you also talked about a potential headwind from enterprise spending. What is the pace of enterprise spending look like right now. And what do you think it will look like going into next year?', ""SASSINE GHAZI: So we have-- if you think of synopsis, we have really three businesses. The first business is design automation.

Through the year, we also widened our differentiation by substantially expanding our AI-driven product capabilities, but also through unique collaborations that strengthened our customers' differentiation while cementing deep, long-term relationships. We thank our employees for their passion and dedication and our customers for their business and trust in Synopsys. Meanwhile, dark geopolitical clouds are inflecting unimaginable harm in multiple conflict zones. Our hearts hurt with deep compassion for our employees, families, colleagues, customers and all others impacted by pain, loss and uncertainty. Yet, we will never give up the leaving in the positive potential of humanity. It is thus heartwarming to see how fast our teams have turned compassion into caring, caring into action. And our respect and support for each other is that active norm at Synopsys.Let me now briefly share some thoughts on the state of the industry and our company before I pass the baton to Sassine. From the first days of Synopsys 37 years ago, Synopsys has enabled and navigated the exponential ambition that came to be defining the semiconductor industry and which, in turn, radically impacted the world. Our initial contribution, Synthesis, revolutionized digital design. We ushered in the transition from CAD, computer-aided design, to EDA, electronic design automation, so far delivering roughly a 10 million x increase in design productivity. During Synopsys' entire existence, the vast majority of our products have been the state-of-the-art. Together with the leading foundries with us empowered digital age exponential referred to as Moore's Law. And then at the very moment that the economics of classic Moore's Law are slowing down in terms of transistor performance and cost improvements, the era of big data and AI becomes real, triggering enormous compute needs on the horizon. About 8 years ago, Synopsys forecasted, this age of Smart Everything would become the driver for the semiconductor growth to $1 trillion in this decade. And here we are. This year's generative AI advances and furious adoption clearly fulfill our vision. As pervasive AI is now massively underway, the classic Moore's Law era in turn, is morphing into the SysMoore era, systemic complexity, but still with a Moore's Law exponential ambition. SysMoore is happening in front of our eyes by reinventing architectures not based on a single chip but on multiple chips, tightly connected or even stacked on top of each other with extreme proximity. These so-called software-defined multi-die architectures will enable massive increases in the number of transistors available. And again, Synopsys is at the heart of the heart of capitalizing exponential impact. Our investments in multi-die design, our massive collection of IP building blocks in many silicon technologies, our prototyping and electronic digital twinning technology that lets customers run software before the hardware actually exists are all essential enablers driving the new race into AI-driven computation. Adding one more spark to our technical leadership, Synopsys has also pioneered the use of deep learning AI and chip design. Applied to optimization, verification and test, production results are outstanding and adoption is broad and rapid. Most recently, our announcement of exciting gen AI capabilities adds yet another angle to driving the state-of-the-art for it. If nothing else, my enthusiasm for both the SysMoore opportunity and for our technology advances to give you a sense of Synopsys is on the move. Talking about on the move, we're also well on the way in our executive leadership transition. I have great confidence, expectations and enthusiasm for Sassine Ghazi as our next CEO. Sassine, please give us your perspective, vision and ambition for Synopsys. The floor is all yours."", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""Thank you, Art, for your pioneering work in our industry and for building Synopsys into one of the world's essential semiconductor ecosystem companies. I am profoundly grateful for the opportunity to succeed you as CEO, building on our strong foundation and propelling Synopsys to the next wave of growth. Let's turn to market trends. Despite global macroeconomic uncertainty, our customers continue to prioritize R&D investments and chip design starts remain robust. We leave 2023 with $8.6 billion in noncancelable backlog and have a time-tested business model that balances dynamic growth with macro resiliency. We expect solid growth across our geographies in 2024, but our outlook reflects a continued challenging near-term growth environment in China. China is an adaptable and large market. However, given the combination of entity list and technology restrictions and a weaker macroeconomic outlook, we believe more pragmatism in our 2024 China forecast is appropriate. Technology trends continue to create a rising tide for our business. Chief among those trends is a new era of AI-driven productivity. AI is reshaping industries and providing breakthrough solutions for intractable challenges, like the 15% to 30% design resource shortage that semiconductor is facing this decade. We pioneered AI-driven semiconductor design and are relentlessly advancing our AI capabilities so that we can drive step-up function improvement in our customers' productivity, and thus, play a greater role in their success. Recently, at Microsoft's Ignite Conference, we announced a breakthrough generative AI capability for accelerating chip design, Synopsys.ai Copilot. The new capability is the result of a strategic collaboration with Microsoft to integrate Azure's service that brings the power of gen AI into one of the most complex engineering challenges, the design process for semiconductors. The integration of gen AI across Synopsys.ai provides chip designers with collaborative capabilities that offer expert tool guidance, generative capabilities to enable RTL and collateral creation, and fully autonomous capabilities for workflow creation from natural language. We're engaged with leading chip makers, including AMD, Intel and Microsoft to deliver the value of gen AI across the Synopsys.ai full EDA stack, from design, verification, test to manufacturing. We are at a very early stage of this new AI era, but our initial customer results are exceptional. AI is key to massively unlocking customer productivity. And we are increasing our investment to accelerate the Synopsys.ai road map. Beyond AI, we see multiple other secular tailwinds providing our design automation and design IP business expanding growth opportunities. With the slowing of Moore's Law, increasingly, architecture and design automation are the main levers in delivering semiconductor PPA gains even as insatiable use case demand push the frontiers of performance and performance per watt. Multi-die implementations are accelerating as our customers seek to optimize cost and yield for these large complex designs. And our customers who rely on our critical competencies from silicon to software now requires systems-level approach both at the semiconductor device level with multi-die and the electronic design, software bring-up and software validation of full systems like today's software-defined cars. Our design IP business also has strong wind in its sails. Applications claimed ever faster ingest and throughput, resulting in faster protocol migrations and increasing IP content value per device. Customers are prioritizing scarce design resources to focus on their critical architectural differentiations and turning to us as an integral part of their chip design development teams for their foundation and interface IP needs. And now all 3 leading edge foundries are making Synopsys the advanced node IP vendor of choice. They are partnering with us on a broad range of IP titles to minimize risk and accelerate silicon success. Our design automation and design IP businesses have both leadership technology and market positions with industry trends playing to our strengths. We're increasing our investment in these segments to capture more of this growing TAM. We started our investments in software integrity with the acquisition of Coverity in 2014. Software Security was a pain point for every company and risk services were expanding. Customers were searching for innovative approaches in quality and security testing to help reduce the risk of software failures and security breaches. And we developed the broadest portfolio to meet that need. Flash forward to today, our Software Integrity business has become the leader in application security testing with industry-leading team delivering over $0.5 billion in trailing 12 months revenue at mid-teens non-GAAP operating margin. We are proud of the significant progress we've made over the last 9 years and believe the future opportunity remains attractive. At the same time, we have compelling investment opportunities in design automation and design IP with much higher expected growth and return profiles. Following our strategic portfolio review, and in consultation with the company's Board of Directors, we have decided to explore strategic alternatives for the Software Integrity business. As part of this process, we're considering full range of strategic opportunities. We will provide an update after we conclude that process. Based on these market and technology trends, and with high confidence in our business, here are our 2024 guidance targets. We expect 2024 revenue between $6.57 billion and $6.63 billion. We expect to deliver 37% non-GAAP operating margin, a 200 basis point improvement versus last year. We expect full year non-GAAP EPS between $13.33 and $13.41. Shelagh will discuss the financials in more detail. Now I'll share some segment highlights starting with Design Automation. This quarter, Synopsys.ai was selected by AspenCore to receive the World Electronics Achievement Award for EDA Software of the Year. We're proud of the recognition but even more excited by the strong customer adoption for Synopsys.ai across the design flow. A major North American hyperscaler made a major commitment to use DSO.ai after demonstrating PPA and productivity benefits on consecutive HPC projects. In verification, we engaged with over 20 customers in Q4, demonstrating up to 10x faster turnaround time. While in test, we added 8 new customer engagements with Kioxia publicly highlighting more than 50% pattern reduction. Finally, we and TSMC announced that our analog migration flow through Synopsys.ai is enabled across TSMC's advanced process technologies. We are also seeing great results deploying Synopsys.ai internally with our IP teams. Internal IP teams are seeing 10x turnaround time improvements in time to target verification coverage and have deployed analog design migration flows for TSMC 2-nanometer. Fusion Compiler continues to win key designs, including the leading-edge ARM mobile core for the industry's first implementation for a gate all around based mobile SoC. In combination with DSO.ai, Fusion Compiler also delivered 10% better power on gate all-around based mobile GPU and modem designs. We saw continued momentum in sign-off delivered by our leadership family of prime tools. We won multiple engagements with PrimeTime, PrimeClosure and Prime Shield and saw the world's top 3 data center providers adopt PrimeClosure to get the fastest ECO closure time for 5 3-nanometer SoCs. Expanding our multi-die ecosystem, we received a prestigious leadership award from TSMC, OIP 2023 Partner of the Year, for developing the industry's first 3DIC design prototyping solution, supporting the new industry standard 3Dblox. Verification, product momentum also remains strong. This quarter, we announced our AI-driven next-generation [VRD] solution, which continues its lead in functional debug with deployment already at more than 10 top semiconductor companies. In hardware-assisted verification, we delivered another record year. In Q4, ZeBu won against competition at 2 large North American hyperscalers and we expanded our [HAPS] footprint with a large North American systems company and a large Asian semiconductor company. Now turning to design IP. This quarter, we won our first 2-nanometer interface IP engagement with a leading mobile company and are now in production at 3-nanometer with foundation IP for a high-volume PC chip.We delivered a key multi-die proof point in concert with Intel and TSMC on UCIe interoperability. The demonstration at Intel Innovation showed die-to-die interconnect over UCIe between Synopsys IP on TSMC and CE and Intel foundry silicon. We saw two other key technology proof points this quarter. We demonstrated interoperability for our 224 gig Ethernet PHY IP and PCIe 6.0 IP, both industry firsts. On the processor IP side, we announced a new addition to the ARC processor IP portfolio, the RISC-V ARC-V processor IP. This product allows customers to choose from a broad range of flexible, extensible processor options that deliver optimal power performance efficiency for their target applications. Finally, we delivered a significant win in automotive, displacing competition at a marquee customer in a multi-generation multiple project agreement. Now to the Software Integrity segment. which delivered solid growth against the backdrop of continued macro headwinds for enterprise software. In Q4, we saw over 50% year-over-year growth in our Polaris Software Integrity Platform. Polaris is a SaaS-based application security testing solution optimized for the needs of development and Dev SecOps teams. We were also recently recognized as a leader in the Forrester Wave for software composition analysis. This was based on an evaluation of Black Duck, our software composition analysis solution. In summary, we had an outstanding Q4 and FY 2023 financial results and operational execution and take tremendous forward momentum into 2024. We have a resilient business model and our customers continue to prioritize investments in the chips and systems that position them for future growth. We are aligning our portfolio investment with the greatest return potential to accelerate our growth. Deepest thanks to our employees, partners and customers for their passion and commitment. With that, I'll turn it over to Shelagh."", 'Shelagh Glaser', ""Thank you, Sassine. 2023 was an excellent year highlighted by record revenue, record non-GAAP operating margin and record earnings. We continue our strong execution with financial discipline and are confident in our business heading into 2024, driven by our execution and leadership position across our segments robust chip and system design activity by our customers who continue to invest through semiconductor cycles and with $8.6 billion in noncancelable backlog, the stability and resilience of our time-based business model. As a result, while the macro environment is uncertain, we expect to grow revenue 12.4% to 13.5%, expand non-GAAP operating margin by approximately 2 percentage points and drive non-GAAP EPS growth of 19% to 20% in 2024. Let me provide some highlights of our full year 2023 results. We generated total revenue of $5.84 billion, up 15% over the prior year, with double-digit growth across all key products and geographies. Total GAAP costs and expenses were $4.6 billion, and total non-GAAP costs and expenses were $3.8 billion, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin of 35.1%. GAAP earnings per share were $7.92 and non-GAAP earnings per share were $11.19 up 26% year-over-year. Now on to our segment. Design Automation segment revenue was $3.78 billion, up 14%, driven by strength in EDA software and hardware. Design Automation adjusted operating margin was 38.1%. Design IP segment revenue was $1.54 billion, up 17%, driven by broad-based strength. Design IP adjusted operating margin was 34.5%. Software Integrity revenue was $525 million, up 13% and adjusted operating margin was 14.5%. Turning to cash. Operating cash flow for the year was $1.7 billion. We ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $1.59 billion and total debt of $18 million. During the year, we completed buybacks of $1.2 billion or 80% of free cash flow. Now to targets, which reflects the impact from export control regulations and assume no further changes for the year. Based on our current assessment of timing of hardware and IP deliveries, we expect the first half, second half split of approximately 48% to 52% for revenue and non-GAAP EPS. For fiscal year 2024, the full year targets are: revenue of $6.57 billion to $6.63 billion; total GAAP costs and expenses between $5.0 billion and $5.05 billion; total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $4.14 billion and $4.18 billion, resulting in non-GAAP operating margin improvement of roughly 2 percentage points. Non-GAAP tax rate of 15%; GAAP earnings of $9.07 to $9.25 per share, non-GAAP earnings of $13.33 to $13.41. Cash flow from operations of approximately $1.4 billion which includes an impact of approximately $200 million of 2023 taxes that we will pay in '24 and approximately $400 million of higher cash taxes due to the amortization of R&D expenses. Following 2024, we expect cash tax growth rate to be approximately in line with operating income growth over a multiyear period. Now to targets for the first quarter, which includes an extra week compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Revenue between $1.63 billion and $1.66 billion, which includes approximately $70 million from the extra week, total GAAP costs and expenses between $1.22 billion and $1.24 billion, total non-GAAP costs and expenses between $1.02 billion and $1.03 billion; GAAP earnings of $2.40 to $2.50 per share, non-GAAP earnings of $3.40 to $3.45 per share, including approximately $0.14 from the extra week. Our press release and financial supplement include additional targets and GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation. I also want to highlight that we will be hosting our Investor Day on March 20, which will be held in conjunction with our Synopsys Users Group event in Santa Clara. We look forward to seeing many of you there. In conclusion, we entered 2024 with momentum and confidence reflecting our leadership position across our segment, robust design activity by our customers who continue to invest through semiconductor cycles and the stability and resiliency of our time-based business. With that, I'll turn it over to the operator for questions."", 'Operator', ""(Operator Instructions) We'll take our first question from Harlan Sur with JPMorgan."", 'Harlan L. Sur', ""Congratulations on the strong execution and fiscal '24 guidance. Hardware verification emulation prototype (inaudible), I mean, this has been a big contributor to your double-digit revenue growth profile over the past number of years. Lots of customers focusing on verification on these very complex chip design, a lot of them wanting to get a head start on the embedded and application software development. Is the team anticipating another strong year next year for hardware? Will it be growing at a double-digit sort of growth rate within your fiscal '24 guidance? And if I look at inventories, right, they're up 53% year-over-year to kind of record levels, which I think is a good indicator of a strong hardware pipeline, but wanted to get your views."", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""Yes. Thanks for the question. In terms of the need, exactly the way you highlighted it, the requirements to develop software early and having a hardware-assisted verification to enable that step in the process is not only continuing, is accelerating with many system companies are trying to design their chip. Or even if they're getting a chip from a semiconductor company, they want to start their software development and verification of the system early. And this is where our HAPS and Zebu platform comes in to enable that part of the solution. We're anticipating that to continue into 2024. As you saw as well, we had a record year for our hardware-assisted verification in '23, and we don't anticipate anything different that will change going into 2024. As for the inventory comment, I'll turn it to Shelagh for comments."", 'Shelagh Glaser', ""Sure. As Sassine said, we had a record in 2023. We expect another record in 2024, and we're building inventory to be able to fulfill our customer demand."", 'Harlan L. Sur', ""Perfect. And maybe a similar question on your IP business, strong growth last year, right, up 17% going forward. I mean just continued tailwinds, right? Chip design complexity, driving more reliance on off-the-shelf IP licensing. And just as importantly, right, there's some pretty big transitions on the interface and connectivity side, PCIe gen 5, CXL, DDR5, HBM3E looking at your pipeline backlog, customer programs, will the IP business be growing slower, faster in line with the fiscal '24 sort of total revenue profile?"", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""So again, exactly the way you're outlining the requirement. There is two factors. There's the complexity. And then there is 0the different methods of designing an SoC or chip with multi-die is opening up the door for new protocols, UCIe, the PCIe, the CXL, the one that you've listed. There are different protocols for various markets for automotive.As they expand their sophistication in developing the electronic system, it requires different requirements for the IP, interface IP for an automotive application. What we outlined in the script as well is today, we are the leading supplier for TSMC, Samsung and Intel foundry business. And that puts us in a great position because most of these complex chip developments are on these advanced foundries. And today, we are in a very fortunate position to be the partner and the leader in providing the IP for that business. So we expect that growth to continue, given the market demand for the sophisticated chips will continue."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Joe Vruwink with Baird."", 'Joseph D. Vruwink', ""Great. Maybe want to start by parsing out some of the demand commentary. So first, there was a big step up in backlog I'd imagine that bodes well for 2024 and 2025 is positive to revenue. At the same time, maybe the incremental moderation you're signaling in China, as I think about just the last 12 months, I think China contributed about 2 points worth of revenue growth, just the incremental revenue contribution from China. So arriving at the 13% growth guidance, are you (inaudible) than 13%. And then China is maybe just a more neutral factor in your outlook?"", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""We really took a balanced approach as we look at the guidance and the forecast for FY '24. We took into account some of the headwinds that we're seeing and of course, the number of the tailwinds that we are observing in the market. A couple of the headwinds, as we mentioned, one of them is China. And the 2 factors. One is the continued export restrictions and the other one that I'm sure all of you are observing, which is the macro economy inside China. The other headwind we took into account is the continued stress and pressure from enterprise software spending that does impact our software integrity business. Some tailwinds, and this is where we get excited about is exactly what we're seeing. The AI as a megatrend is driving amazing silicon demand and that silicon demand is complex. It's on the most advanced nodes and it's giving us an amazing opportunity for our design automation and design IP. So as we took into account the both headwinds and the tailwinds. We came with a balanced view of the guidance around 13% midpoint for FY '24."", 'Joseph D. Vruwink', ""Okay. That's clear. And then just on the topic of generative AI. I did want to maybe get your take, if it's possible to contrast just the pace of product development incorporating such a technology relative to what you've done in the past? And I guess the context for this question, as I think back to DAC in July, there were actually members of the Microsoft verification team speaking about how they wanted more robust tools from their EDA vendors that incorporated gen AI and we're not very far from July. And here you are with a product in conjunction with Microsoft and now Microsoft verification is using this in their workflows. So it seems like a very quick turnaround. Is it that much quicker than maybe what Synopsys was able to do in the past?"", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""Maybe we made it look too easy, Joe, but there was a lot of work that started well ahead of the DAC time frame. If I take a quick step back, when we talk about Synopsys.ai, there are really 4 pillars under it. The one that we -- the first one we did produce was DSO.ai in the 2020 time frame. That was focused mostly on optimizing the -- our product and using every opportunity to leverage machine learning and AI in the product and around the product.The second pillar, which is what we're calling a collaborative capability using gen AI, and that's what we announced with Microsoft, which is using a CoPilot approach for supporting our users for knowledge-based or workflow base or results, CoPilot and assistance. And that's in our announcement where AMD, Intel, Microsoft were some of the early users of the technology. Then we talked a little bit about what's coming down the path, which is around both generative and autonomous capability using gen AI and natural language. We're super excited actually about the early results we're seeing with the CoPilot in terms of the productivity of our customers and users."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities."", 'Vivek Arya', ""If I remove the -- I think you said about $17 million or so impact of the extra week. You're guiding to roughly 12% sales growth right, which seems to be very conservative relative to the strong backlog that you have built up. So I'm curious, Sassine, I think you mentioned the impact of China and enterprise software and AI is kind of neutral, but then when I look at the 12% growth that is lower than what you had in the last 3 years, even though there is all this AI excitement that's starting now. So is it conservative? How should we kind of put this 12% in the context of the kind of growth rates we are used to seeing from Synopsys over the last 3 years?"", 'Shelagh Glaser', ""So Vivek, thanks for the question. This is Shelagh. I'll jump in on that. So we're obviously taking a balanced stance as Sassine talked about at the we're at a 13% growth year-over-year. And we're seeing design automation, design IP have incredibly strong momentum. You mentioned the $8.6 billion backlog. We're seeing that growth in line with our long-term targets. And we're seeing AI as a catalyst, but it's in its early inning. So we think it's a long-term growth catalyst. And we're looking forward to having it be able to help drive our business over the horizon. But the 2 headwinds are China, as we've talked about, the macro situation in China and the restrictions that have been imposed on China, are having some dampening effect. We expect China to grow in '24, but at a lesser rate than it grew in '23. And the other headwind that we have is we are expecting a muted environment for enterprise software spend to impact our Software Integrity business, and we're assuming that, that business will be single-digit growth in 2024. So it's the combination of those headwinds and tailwinds that's leading to our 13% growth rate at the midpoint."", 'Vivek Arya', ""Got it. And for my follow-up, the AI CoPilot, seems like a very interesting new product. I'm curious what is the right way to track how you are able to monetize it? Are you selling it as incremental feature. Are you selling it as a separate tool, right? What is the right way to just kind of track how successful you are with this capability?"", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""So the way we're thinking and we expect this over the last few calls, which is AI will be offered to our customers through a subscription license, meaning, if a customer wants to use an AI capability, be it a DSO.ai or VSO.ai, it will be offered as an incremental spend for the customer to get access to that technology.And in some early adopter cases where they're still not ready to make the long-term commitment, we're offering it as well in terms of consumption base. They may be looking for one project to use it, et cetera. And the CoPilot in particular case, it's still very early, very early stage in terms of us to talk about monetization and how is it contributing overall. But those are the flexibility tools per se, we're providing the customer to get access to it."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Jason Celino with KeyBanc."", 'Jason Vincent Celino', ""Great. The backlog number, it's quite impressive. Looking back at the last couple of years, it looks like it's sequentially the biggest quarter-over-quarter increase we've ever seen, up 20% year-over-year. Just wanted to check how much of this has been driven just from the AI design activity or the AI tool revenue. It sounds like it was more broad-based, but just wanted to check."", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""With AI, we communicated last quarter that what we're observing on average and that's average -- emphasizing the average because in some cases, we're seeing a much bigger number or lesser number. About 20% contract over contract growth when a customer is renewing their EDA agreement and asking for the AI capability to be added. The other point that I made earlier with Vivek, I'd like to emphasize as well, that we are in early stages of that monetization with AI. We still have customers that they are in early adoption, meaning if they have x number of projects, they may be using it on 1 or 2 projects and other customers, they stopped early and they're going more aggressively. But to give you a sense, it's roughly 20% on the EDA side, contract over contract growth we're observing."", 'Jason Vincent Celino', ""Okay. Interesting. And then one question on the OCF guidance. It will be down next year. Are you saying that there's a $600 million headwind from cash taxes and then additional amortization and then are you saying it's going to grow just in line with net income growth that you're after? Can you clarify?"", 'Shelagh Glaser', ""Yes, Jason, thanks for the question. So the total impact from taxes is $600 million as we're moving to the new tax guidance where R&D is capitalized. Out of that $600 million, $200 million of it was payable in November. We've already paid it, which was for 2023 and then $400 million of that $600 million is for 2024. And again, both of those are impacted by the amortization of R&D. As we move forward, as we move into 2025 and beyond, we anticipate that the growth of the cash tax rate will align with the growth of our operating income. So there is a bit of a big step up this year. We do not anticipate that same level step up as we move forward."", 'Jason Vincent Celino', 'Got. But this is the new base level, right?', 'Shelagh Glaser', ""It is because we're now going forward for the foreseeable future, we will be amortizing R&D. And for us, about half of our R&D is in the U.S. and about half of our R&D is outside the U.S. So that new scheme is with us for the foreseeable future."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Jay Vleeschhouwer with Griffin Securities."", 'Jay Vleeschhouwer', ""For Aart and Sassine, first, then a financial follow-up for Shelagh. For Aart and Sassine, one of the tailwinds that you've had for the last number of years, and we've spoken about this often is what you've referred to as domain-specific architectures on the part of your customers or specialty chips. And AI is probably a very special case of that. The question is, how do you think the whole phenomenon of the main specific design at either the chip or system level is going to be fundamentally altered by the AI phenomenon? And in turn, what does it mean for any additional investments you need to make outside of R&D, for example, in AE capacity services, et cetera?"", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""Yes. Thank you, Jay, for the question. You're right. The whole domain-specific architecture I want to say, about 6, 7 years ago, we started seeing a number of customers investing in it mostly hyperscalers. And you can argue before that couple of the mobile companies started optimizing based on their own system software optimizing their silicon. With the hyperscalers, initially, the target was -- can they -- based on the workload -- on a specific workload, can they develop a chip that is more effective for power, performance cost, et cetera. And the answer is yes, and they made a number of these investments. Now you're seeing another wave of expanded investment around AI and how can they train the models that they are creating for, again, their specific applications. And I'm sure you've noticed in the last couple of weeks almost the top 3 hyperscalers announce their own silicon investments and chips for AI specific training to drive more optimization and efficiency for their workloads. What that means for Synopsys is not only it's another chip that our customer base is investing in, which drives both EDA and IP, typically, they are the most advanced node and different methodology in many cases, they're pushing towards multi-die and chiplets, which opens up the door for IP and the comments I made earlier. From our solution point of view, yes, we're expanding the solution offering to enable our customers to design these complex chips. On IP, I want to say it's fairly straightforward. You deliver 2 standards to connect these chips. But the work is not straightforward, but the road map is fairly straightforward what you need to do. On the EDA side, we have a number of those customers using 3DIC Compiler, which gives them the ability to architect that chip for that system in that case. SLM, the silicon life cycle management to give them the ability to trace the health and the connectivity of these dies into the system and all the way in the field or in the hyperscale case as it sits into their data center and it's up and running. So we have a number of expansions in our portfolio in order to support these opportunities. And that's why we are bullish and excited about the opportunity to continue the growth for design, automation and design IP."", 'Jay Vleeschhouwer', 'Okay. For Shelagh, one of the largest components of your backlog has been FSAs which are, I would assume, largely related to IP. Is there any reason to believe that in future, the pull down of FSAs for IP consumption would be faster or larger than has been the case to date. And for that matter, were FSA is a large component of the $1.5 billion sequential increase in backlog, which you noted.', 'Shelagh Glaser', ""There's not a -- I wouldn't note a different percent of FSAs. It's certainly something that many of our customers who are purchasing IP preferred that model, but there's not a different mix."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Charles Shi with Needham."", 'Yu Shi', ""Congrats on the very strong results, guidance and the backlog number. I want to ask a little bit -- I think a little bit more into the backlog number because you have relatively consistent, I mean, ratios in terms of how much backlog goes into RPO, how much RPO goes into current RPO and how much the current RPO covers next year's revenue. With that at the same ratio as in the past few years, I thought you would have guided a little bit higher given that $8.6 billion backlog. So how should I reconcile this? Is it something like at this time, the average contract duration is a little bit longer within that $8.6 billion backlog? Or there's some conservatism around what will you want to guide for '24?"", 'Shelagh Glaser', ""Yes. Thanks for the question. So the backlog was broad-based. It was across multiple customers. And as Sassine said, some of them was larger renewals and new deals that we booked. There was -- there's no change in the duration in our contracts. So there's no change from our typical duration. As we were putting the forecast together for the year, we are really balancing the headwinds and tailwinds that we're seeing in the business, and we're seeing -- because of the backlog, we're seeing very strong momentum in the core business in design automation and design where we're seeing the headwinds is on China, in particular, which obviously has been a large growth driver for us for the last several years. We're seeing that growth rate slower and then the other one is SIG, which the Software Integrity business is still -- we anticipate going to be impacted by a difficult software enterprise purchasing environment. And so that's why we've got that business forecast at single-digit growth. So it's really the balancing of those things. But we are seeing design automation and design IP aligned with our long-term goals for those businesses."", 'Yu Shi', ""Yes. Maybe a quick follow-up on the half-over-half profile for next year because I mean, I would think that EDA revenue, I mean, because of its time-based nature and you guys keep signing bigger contracts, you tend to be like up to the right kind of profile through the year. but you're relatively flattish half-over-half profile seems to suggest that the IP maybe some of the hardware is going to be a little bit front half loaded. Is that the case? And why is that a thing?"", 'Shelagh Glaser', ""Yes. It's really just the balance of how we see the customers wanting to ingest our hardware and our IP business. So it's fairly aligned also with what we saw in '23 and fairly aligned with what we saw in '21."", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""Maybe, Charles, if I'll add a couple of comments to what Shelagh just said. Rough numbers, our design automation is about 65% of our business and then design IP, 25% and software -- 10% and the $8.6 billion is mostly those agreements in EDA and IP and given the large percentage of the overall revenue we have, which is 25% is IP. There's a different pull down and development of the IP, especially on the advanced nodes, when we're talking about we're developing our IP portfolio on the most advanced foundries, from the day you sign an agreement to the day you deliver, there's a time lapse by when did you deliver the IP and you get the pull down.So while the backlog number, the $8.6 billion is large, we need to get, I would say, used to that the consumption for EDA and IP will be very different across that backlog number and the timing of the renewal et cetera."", 'Trey Campbell', ""Thanks, Charles. Let's do one more question and then if you could turn it back over to me, Lisa."", 'Operator', ""We'll take our next question from Gianmarco Conti with Deutsche Bank."", 'Gianmarco Paolo Conti', ""So I guess the first one would be, how should we think about the recurring revenue rate into 2024? Is it fair to assume that given that we're expecting another record hard of the year into '24, it will inch closer to 80%.And secondly, could you provide some more color on the SIG strategic initiatives that you're considering?"", 'Sassine Ghazi', ""Maybe I'll talk about the SIG initiative, and Shelagh will comment on the backlog. The -- what we've said in the remarks that we went through a strategic portfolio review, just to put some context around what we went through. As I stated earlier, we have the 3 business segments and we are truly fortunate that we have a leading position in each one of those segments. As we look at the opportunities over the next 5 to 10 years of these market segments, I cannot express how excited we are about the opportunities we have in design automation and design IP. And the more we can expand our portfolio within these market segments. So that led us to discuss and make a decision to explore the strategic alternatives for software integrity to put priority of where to make our investments and where we believe there's a higher ROI for the investments based on the 90% of our portfolio between the design automation and design IP business segments. So that's really the process that we went through in order to get to that point."", 'Shelagh Glaser', ""Yes. And I would add that on the recurring revenue question, we're not expecting a substantial change in that. We've had a record hardware year in '22 and '23, and we're expecting another one in '24, but the overall business is growing too. So it won't substantially change the mix of recurring revenue."", 'Trey Campbell', 'Thanks, Johnny. Let me turn it over to Aart for some closing remarks.', 'Aart J. de Geus', ""Thank you. A couple of personal words in closure here. Since the IPO in 1992, this is my 128th earnings call. I did not miss a single one, but I suspect that literally only (inaudible) remembers exactly what was said at each one of these calls. So a big thank you to you, Jay. But really huge gratitude to all of you for your feedback, your write-ups, your advocacy on the market. but also for never giving up on asking questions where you perfectly well know that we will never answer them. So I really hope that you will keep that up with Sassine, but more importantly, a gratitude for having been travel made and family members in raising this fragile Synopsys start-up child into the strong worldwide market and technology leader that is today. Thank you. Now some CEO transitions are hard, but I think we're doing very well. Sassine is the perfect choice for CEO. He already leads with ambition, heart and smart and of course, his 25 years of experience at Synopsys is comprehended is complemented, I should say, by great customer relationships and very importantly, trust. Sassine has my respect, my enthusiasm and my full support. So please give him your support as well. With that, I look forward to from time to time, touching base with you, so until then, be well and thank you very much."", 'Trey Campbell', 'Thanks, everyone, for joining the call. Lisa, can you close this out?', 'Operator', ""Thank you. And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation today. You may now disconnect. And that does conclude today's presentation. Thank you.""]"

The recovery in group and business transient demand from the pandemic lows continues to benefit the company. Its capital-recycling efforts and healthy balance sheet support its growth endeavors. However, a cautious approach by many businesses may lead to a slower-than-anticipated recovery in business transient and group travel demand. Also, elevated interest rates pose a concern.', 'Host Hotels enjoys a portfolio of luxury and upper-scale hotels in the top 20 U.S. markets, with a strong presence in the attractive Sunbelt region. These properties are strategically located in central business districts of major cities with close proximity to airports and resort/conference destinations. This is likely to drive the demand for the company’s properties in the upcoming period.', 'The lodging industry is presently witnessing a recovery from its low during the health crisis. As a result, the improvement in group and business transient demand has aided occupancy and RevPAR growth in recent quarters. From the beginning of 2023 through Sep 30, comparable hotel RevPAR increased 10.4% from the 2022 levels. For 2023, management expects comparable hotel RevPAR growth to be between 7.25% and 8.75%. We expect the metric to exhibit year-over-year growth of 7.8% this year.', 'This lodging real estate investment trust (REIT) has been undertaking strategic capital allocations to enhance the quality of its portfolio, where it has a greater scale and competitive advantage. It has incurred $472 million of capital expenditure from the beginning of 2023 through Sep 30.', 'The company reached an agreement with Hyatt to complete transformational reinvestment capital projects at six properties in its portfolio, intended to position the targeted hotels to compete better in their respective markets and improve long-term performance. The total investment is expected to be nearly $500-$600 million, of which Host Hotels plans to invest nearly $125-$200 million per year over the next three to four years on this program. For the current year, management expects to incur a total capital expenditure of $615-$695 million.', 'Host Hotels’ capital-recycling efforts are encouraging. Over the years, HST has disposed of its non-strategic assets that have lower growth potential or properties with significant capital expenditures and redeployed the proceeds for investments in better-yielding assets. Such initiatives highlight its prudent capital-management practices and preserve balance sheet growth.', 'Per the company’s November 2023 Investor Presentation, from 2021 through the end of the third quarter of 2023, its total dispositions amounted to approximately $1.53 billion, which is 17.5 times the EBITDA multiple. Its acquisitions were around $1.87 billion, which is 13.1 times the EBITDA multiple, during this period. Our estimate suggests a year-over-year increase of 10.5% in EBITDA in the current year.', 'HST maintains a healthy balance sheet with no material debt maturities until April 2024. As of Sep 30, 2023, the company had $2.6 billion in total available liquidity. Moreover, it is the only company with an investment-grade rating among lodging REITs. It enjoys ratings of Baa3 from Moody’s and BBB- from both Fitch and S&P Global, providing access to the debt market at favorable rates. This financial flexibility will aid capital deployment for long-term growth opportunities and facilitate redevelopment activities.', ""Over the past six months, shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have gained 5.1% compared with the industry's upside of 1.2%."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'The recovery in transient and group business travel demand, although having picked up the pace since the start of the pandemic, is likely to be tepid in the near term due to a delayed return to the office and limited face-to-face conferences. In the third quarter of 2023, the company noted that transient demand recovered more slowly in certain markets, particularly in San Francisco and Seattle, while room rates at resort hotels moderated. Moreover, given the present macroeconomic uncertainty, management expects its operations in specific markets to stay uneven in the near term.', ""Host Hotels faces competition from other owners and investors in upper upscale and luxury full-service hotels. Also, the growth of Internet reservation channels is likely to fuel competition, as more people are booking hotel rooms through the online mode. This may adversely impact the company's revenues and profitability. Further, the spike in online short-term rentals has elevated supply in the lodging industry, leading to increased competition in some markets."", 'Additionally, a high interest rate environment may lead to greater borrowing costs for the company, hampering its ability to acquire or develop real estate. For 2023, We expect a year-over-year increase of 21.1% in its interest expenses. Further, due to high interest rates, its dividend payout may seem less attractive than the yields on fixed-income and money market accounts.', 'Some better-ranked stocks from the REIT sector are EastGroup Properties EGP, Stag Industrial STAG and Innovative Industrial Properties IIPR, each carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

This often leads to a sell-off of the shares. In 2020, hotel real estate investment trusts (REITs) suffered huge declines in revenue per available room (RevPAR) as COVID-19 crushed the number of hotel reservations and many REITs were forced to cut or suspend their dividends.', 'But by 2022, RevPAR began making a comeback, and hotel REITs were able to reinstate small quarterly dividends. With RevPAR growing further in 2023, several hotel REITs have greatly expanded their dividend payouts.', 'Warren Buffett once said, ""If you don\'t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.""

Its portfolio of nine hotels includes over 11,400 rooms and more than 3 million square feet of meeting space. Ryman also has a 70% controlling ownership interest in Opry Entertainment Group, which owns the Grand Ole Opry and other entertainment attractions.', 'COVID-19 forced Ryman to suspend its $0.95 quarterly dividend after the March 2020 payout, and the dividend was reinstated at $0.10 per share in September 2022. The December 2022 payout was then raised to $0.25 per share.', ""But Ryman has brought back the dividend with even more vigor in 2023, increasing it to $0.75 in March and then another hike to $1 for June and September. That's a 300% increase in total. The present annual yield is 4.03%, but with a payout ratio of only 40%, Ryman investors could see another dividend increase in December, or more likely sometime in 2024."", 'RLJ Lodging Trust (NYSE:RLJ) is a Bethesda, Maryland-based hotel REIT that owns 96 premium-branded hotels with 21,200 rooms across 23 states and Washington, D.C. Its brands include Marriott, Hilton Garden Inn, Embassy Suites and Hyatt.', 'To its credit, RLJ Lodging never suspended its dividend during the pandemic in 2020, but a drastic cut from $0.33 to $0.01 per share in March 2020 coincided with a 75% decline in its share price. The dividend was finally increased to $0.05 per share for both the September and December 2022 payments.', 'In 2023, RLJ raised the dividend to $0.08 in March and then to $0.10 in September, for a total increase of 100%. Its forward funds from operations (FFO) payout is still only 24.8%, leaving plenty of room for further increases to come. The present annual yield is 3.76%.', 'Summit Hotel Properties Inc.

In May 2023, it hiked the dividend payment by 50% to $0.06 per share, and it has remained at that level for the last three quarters.

Host Hotels is the only lodging REIT member of the S&P 500.', 'Host Hotels suspended its quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share after March 2020 but reinstated it at $0.03 per share in March 2022. Host then increased the dividend to $0.06 in June and $0.12 in September 2022. In December, it declared a special dividend of $0.20 per share to bring the total fourth-quarter dividend to $0.32.', 'In June 2023, Host raised the quarterly dividend from $0.12 to $0.15 per share and increased it once more to $0.18 per share in September. The total dividend growth for 2023 was 50%.

Earnings rose 6% year over year due to higher revenues, which were partially offset by higher operating costs.Total revenues of $6.90 billion missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6.96 billion. Total revenues rose 4% year over year, driven by higher product sales.Total product revenues increased 5% from the year-ago quarter to $6.55 billion (U.S.: $4.69 billion; ex-U.S.: $1.86 billion). Higher volumes were partially offset by lower selling prices of several drugs. Volumes rose 11% in the quarter, partially offset by a 3% lower net selling price and 3% unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions.Other revenues were $355 million in the quarter, down 14.5% year over year due to lower revenues from its COVID-19 manufacturing collaboration.The company witnessed robust volume growth across all its three therapeutic areas, general medicine, inflammation and hematology-oncology portfolios.', 'General MedicineProlia revenues came in at $986 million, up 14% from the year-ago quarter, driven by volume growth and higher net selling prices. Prolia sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $983 million but missed our model estimate of $992 million. Prolia volumes are expected to continue to grow.Evenity recorded sales of $307 million in the quarter, up 53% year over year, driven by volume growth in and outside the United States. Evenity sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $284 million as well as our model estimate of $289 million.Repatha generated revenues of $406 million, up 31% year over year, as higher volume was partially offset by lower prices due to new formulary coverage by CVS in July for commercial patients. The volume growth was backed by a record number of new patients starting treatment. Repatha sales marginally missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $407 million but beat our model estimate of $400 million.Aimovig recorded sales of $94 million in the quarter, down 12% year over year due to lower net selling price.Hematology-OncologyXgeva delivered revenues of $519 million, up 5% year over year, driven by higher net selling prices. Xgeva sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of $522 million and $527 million, respectively.Kyprolis recorded sales of $349 million, up 10% year over year, driven by volume growth.Vectibix revenues came in at $252 million, up 2% year over year, driven by volume growth and higher selling price, which were partially offset by unfavorable foreign exchange impact.Nplate sales rose 45% to $419 million, driven by volume growth, driven by a $142 million order from the U.S. government. Amgen expects to fulfill another $62 million order from the U.S. government in the fourth quarter.Blincyto sales increased 55% from the year-ago period to $220 million, also driven by volume growth as the drug benefited from broad prescribing for patients with B-cell precursor ALL and updated NCCN guidelines that were issued in May.Lumakras/Lumykras recorded sales of $52 million in the quarter, down 31% from the year-ago period, due to unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions related to ongoing reimbursement negotiations in France. Lumakras/Lumykras sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $87 million as well as our model estimate of $95 million.In oncology biosimilars, sales of Kanjinti (Amgen’s biosimilar of Roche’s Herceptin) were $20 million, down 72% year over year due to lower pricing and volumes as a result of increased competition.Sales of Mvasi (biosimilar of Roche’s Avastin) were $213 million in the quarter, up 2% year over year, driven by volume growth and favorable changes to estimated sales deductions, which were partially offset by lower pricing.InflammationSales of Otezla were $567 million in the quarter, down 10%, due to lower pricing, unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions and lower inventory levels. Otezla sales in the United States continue to be hurt by free drug programs launched by new competitors. In the United States, Otezla sales price declined due to higher rebates to support expanded access for commercial and Medicare Part D patients. Otezla sales missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $635 as well as our estimate of $620 million.On the conference call, Amgen said it is seeing a reduced impact of the free drug programs. Amgen is also making investments to educate physicians about the benefits of Otezla for appropriate patients and has increased the Otezla sales force by 20%. Amgen expects these initiatives to drive Otezla’s return to growth.Enbrel revenues of $1.04 billion declined 6% year over year due to unfavorable changes to estimated sales deductions, which offset the impact of slightly improved volumes. Enbrel sales beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate, both of which stood at $1.02 billion. Similar to the second quarter, improved payer coverage led to increase in new patients, which, in turn, led to some better volume growth in the third quarter. Amgen expects improved coverage to continue to lead to new patient growth and thus support volumes. However, prices are expected to continue to decline.Newly approved asthma drug, Tezspire (tezepelumab) recorded sales of $161 million in the quarter, up 21% sequentially, driven by volume growth. Tezspire volumes benefited from the launch of a self-administered, pre-filled, single-use pen formulation of the drug in the first quarter, improving patient convenience and accessibility and also more flexibility in treatment options.Amgevita sales were $152 million in the quarter, up 30% year over year, driven by 53% volume growth, partially offset by lower inventory levels and net selling price.New drug Tavneos generated $37 million in sales in the third quarter compared with $30 million in the previous quarter. The drug’s 23% sequential growth was driven by new patient volume growth. Tavneos, approved for the treatment of patients with ANCA-associated vasculitis, a serious systemic autoimmune disease, was added to Amgen’s portfolio with the 2022 acquisition of ChemoCentryx.Established ProductsTotal sales of established products, which include Epogen, Aranesp, Parsabiv and Neulasta, decreased 30% year over year in the third quarter.', 'Adjusted operating margin declined 0.5 percentage points to 52.0% in the quarter. Adjusted operating expenses increased 4% to $3.50 billion.R&D expenses fell 2% year over year to $1.07 billion.

Adjusted EPS in the fourth quarter is expected to be lower than the third quarter due to increased investments in pipeline candidates like maridebart cafraglutide, olpasiran and AMG 193. In addition, the recognition of interest expense related to the Horizon financing will also hurt EPS in the fourth quarter.Adjusted cost of sales as a percent of product sales is expected to be 16% to 17% in 2023 (maintained).Adjusted R&D costs are expected to increase by about 10% year over year from the 2022 level versus the prior expectation of 5%. S&A spending is expected to decrease slightly year over year, driven by productivity improvements (maintained). Total operating expenses are expected to increase around 10% versus the prior expectation of 3% from 2022 level due to the closing of the Horizon acquisition. Amgen expects operating margin as a percentage of product sales to be roughly 50% in 2023.The adjusted tax rate is expected to be in the range of 16.5% to 17.0% (previously 17.5%-18.5%), while capital expenditures are now expected to be approximately $950 million (previously $925 million).

For the third quarter, we drove strong performance led by the strength of our 2 global iconic brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. And our disciplined execution of brand building growth plan, the PVH+ Plan.Despite an increasingly choppy macro backdrop, particularly in Europe, we grew overall revenue in line with guidance, up 4% on a reported basis and up 1% in constant currency, while expanding our gross margins, and we beat our guidance for the bottom line. We drove high single-digit growth in our direct-to-consumer business with growth across both brands in all regions. This included double-digit growth in our owned and operated e-commerce and mid-single-digit growth in our stores.Partially offsetting the strength in B2C trends, we experienced incrementally more challenging trends in wholesale brought by the tougher macro environment. As a company, we are driving a much more profitable business. On a non-GAAP basis, in Q3, we grew EBIT by 13% versus last year with strong margin expansion. And in Q4, we project to grow EBIT by over 30% versus last year, with an approximate 12% EBIT margin. Looking ahead, we are reaffirming our EBIT margin, and we are increasing our EPS guidance by $0.10 for the full year on a non-GAAP basis.By focusing on what's within our control for the full year 2023, we remain well positioned to buy meaningful margin expansion and double-digit EPS growth. We just came out of the important Thanksgiving and Black Friday week, one of the key consumer moments during the holiday period. And I'm pleased to share that in both North America and in Europe, we beat our growth plans versus last year and delivered a strong start of the holiday season. We continue to make strong progress and gain increasing traction across all 5 growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan. And we relentlessly lean into the execution on winning with product, winning with consumer engagement, winning in the marketplace, as well as developing a data and demand-driven supply chain and investing in growth while driving efficiencies.And as I mentioned on our last call, each of our growth drivers plays an important role. And it's when we play them all together, that's something really powerful happens. And let me share some concrete examples on how we made that come to life this quarter. First, our strong D2C growth was fueled by increased product and supply chain strength that drove higher gross margins. The sales growth was supported by a nearly 20% increase in marketing investments with strong cut-through campaigns and global talent amplification. From a regional perspective, we drove constant currency revenue growth for our combined Calvin and Tommy businesses for all regions.Our outperformance in the quarter was driven by North America, which is a very important proof point for how we are already positioning both Calvin and Tommy for long-term sustainable growth in the region through strong execution of the PVH+ Plan. For the second consecutive quarter, our EBIT margin for our Calvin and Tommy businesses in North America together took a sizable step forward and expanded to 13.1% in the quarter, with significant gross margin expansion in both our direct-to-consumer and wholesale business.Inventory continues to be in great shape, both in composition and in levels, down 19% at the end of the quarter, as we made significant progress increasing overall inventory productivity as part of our actions to lower inventory in relation to sales by 25% by the end of fiscal 2024, all while improving availability. For the first half of 2024, we also see decreases in our AUC with more than 5%. This is partly driven by favorable macro but even more importantly, it's driven by an improved approach to our costing process, the first results of a better raw material strategy and early returns on a much sharper assortment productivity.We continue to invest in growth while driving cost efficiencies and are improving our cash flow, increasing share buybacks, showing our confidence in our ability to execute over the long term. During the quarter, we further sharpened our focus on our 2 core brands with the divestiture of Heritage Brands. The proceeds from the transaction will be used to repurchase stock and we now expect to repurchase approximately $550 million of our stock, up from $400 million previously.Finally, it will be the strength of our brands, our consistency in direction and our relentless execution of the PVH+ Plan that will set us apart over time. And this will, in turn, be driven by the quality of the management team, which we have strengthened significantly over the past year. I'm happy to share the addition of Lea Rytz Goldman, who will join us as Global Brand President of Tommy Hilfiger in spring 2024. Lea is a uniquely strong and experienced brand and business builder with an outstanding track record building brands globally. Under Lea's leadership, the Tommy Hilfiger brand will operate in the same way our global Calvin Klein business operates today under Eva Serrano, creating a consistent and unified global brand structure. Each of our 2 brands now has one leader who sets the vision, leads product creation, brand marketing and consumer experience globally, working closely with our regional teams who inform those strategies and lead the brand to win in the marketplace.Now let me share a bit more of what drove our performance in the quarter, both from a global brand and regional perspective. Starting with Calvin Klein. Throughout the third quarter, Calvin continued to focus on driving very strong consumer engagement globally through our most important hero products and driving a strong category offers with growth across our refined performance in underwear categories. It was another quarter where we delivered cut-through campaigns globally and continue to amplify our talent partnerships. When we last spoke, the brand has just launched its fall campaign, which included our long-term ambassadors, Jennie Kim, Jung Kook, Kendall Jenner, wearing our most essential underwear, denim and refined women's wear styles. Cut through with nearly 4 million average video views on TikTok and over 20% engagement rate on Instagram.As part of the fall campaign, the brand also launched a surprise performance with Jung Kook in Times Square New York. The concept was announced only 30 minutes beforehand and tens of thousands of fans gathered within minutes. Jung Kook and his whole crew were dressed in iconic Calvin Klein, and their looks were immediately shoppable on our side. It was a perfect example on how we amplify global talent to win with consumer engagement.For holiday, the brand campaign features Hailey Bieber in iconic Calvin Klein stars, where our hero products are prominently featured on social through shoppable content to drive commercial impact.Finally, I'm excited about the progress we are making to align Calvin Klein to one global brand vision. Since joining, Eva has been focused on tapping into Calvin's core DNA to make the brand more current than ever. As part of this work, we are expanding the capabilities of our global product teams here in New York, to drive a more unified product vision across key categories to win serving all markets.Let me now share a few examples from Tommy Hilfiger. This fall, the Tommy brand reinforced its core DNA. Going back to Classic American Cool and iconic Tommy Lifestyle through our family-focused seasonal campaign. As part of this campaign with a special focus on Asia, we celebrated the K-Pop band Stray Kids' VMA win with a warm welcome to the Tommy family, breaking our record of social media engagement in the first 30 minutes. When we connect the brand in authentic ways with global talent like this, our fans respond, and we expand our reach and influence.We combined another culturally relevant moment with aspirational talent when Tommy campaign star SZA, hosted a New York Fashion Week brunch with over 100 VIP guests and influencers generating over 800 million impressions on social. And just 2 weeks ago, at the Las Vegas Formula One Grand Prix, we expanded our partnership with Formula One by welcoming one of Hollywood's biggest rising stars, Damson Idris, to the Tommy Hilfiger brand family as our newest men's ambassador. Together with Damson, Tommy hosted a number of events with key influencers featuring day and night Tommy looks.For the holiday, our Tommy campaign celebrates the happiness of returning home, families and friends are captured in Tommy's Classic American Prep with the twist as they unite to celebrate the season, all amplified by very strong talent.Now let me turn to our regional performance. I'd like to start with North America, which is a big proof point for us this quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we made significant progress building the foundation for sustainable, increasingly profitable brand accretive growth for the region, and I'm very encouraged by the major initial traction we are gaining. Our Tommy and Calvin businesses together delivered high-quality, low single-digit revenue growth and most importantly, a 13.1% EBIT margin in the quarter, including higher gross margins and higher AURs. We drove outperformance for both our direct-to-consumer businesses and our wholesale business, which showed meaningful sequential improvement, and this is with still a big part of the pre-pandemic tourism, not yet back.Let me share a few highlights. For Tommy, our D2C growth continues to be driven by our best premium Style Essentials, which increased by over 50% compared to last year, supported by elevated in-store execution. For Calvin, leading with our category offense, we delivered our third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in the refined category, the expanded Essentials focus was also once again a standout, supported by an integrated marketing campaign and elevated execution on ck.com.Across both brands, we drove another quarter of double-digit growth in our owned and operated e-commerce businesses. This was driven by the elevation of our brands through stronger storytelling improved site merchandising and new conversion tools. Within wholesale, while our partners remain conservative we continue to see strong gains resulting from our efforts to build a much stronger business with our key partners such as Macy's. Let me share some examples.We drove double-digit year-over-year growth in Tommy test stores, where we have invested together with Macy's in stronger field team coverage. And we are driving double-digit AUR growth at Macy's through the ongoing success with our improved product assortment, including our Polo offense and seasonal categories. For Calvin, our men's Essentials business increased over 50% at Macy's with investments in the right premium essential base assortment. We also saw strength in refined categories, which grew 25%. I'm very proud of our North American team's execution this past quarter, and we now have the team, the plan and the disciplined execution in place to unlock our full potential in the region.Turning to Europe. We continue to drive growth this quarter, building on our historically large business, market-leading awareness and overall brand strength in the region. In the third quarter, we delivered high single-digit revenue growth on a reported basis and low single-digit growth in euros against a record-breaking quarter last year. Our revenue exceeded EUR 1 billion, led by mid-single-digit growth in D2C for each brand. In wholesale, we confirmed our pre-spring Spring '24 order book at low single-digit growth on a constant currency basis with pre-spring already shipping in Q3, leading to timing differences versus Q4 last year.Like others, we have seen a more challenging macroeconomic backdrop in Europe, and that is impacting consumer confidence and the wholesale channel. Additionally, this quarter, just as we were about to kick off the fall season, we saw the longest streak of record-setting warm weather in Europe since the 1800s. Both factors have driven an increasingly promotional environment in the marketplace. And for us, the heat wave in September was a double whammy, given our historical strength in outerwear, sweaters and heavyweight nets.Weather aside, going forward, we anticipate this challenging macro backdrop and an increasingly cautious wholesale channel to continue into 2024. In this environment, we are not sitting still. We are leveraging our market-leading strength and driving much increased profitability and proactively adjusting how we operate. We're taking our PVH+ Plan execution to the next level, and we are doing this in 2 main ways.First, against the current macro backdrop in the wholesale channel, we feel that it's critically important to avoid having too much inventory in the market. Even if that means less selling in to secure strong sellout with high margin and less discounting. Our main priority independent of macro for both brands will always be to strengthen our position for long-term sustainable brand accretive growth.Second, we will lean into the next level of PVH+ execution through DTC and with our key wholesale partners, leveraging our key strengths in product, consumer engagement and marketplace management. I'll highlight a few examples of how you will see this in action. Across both brands, we have product innovation coming for 2024. In technical fabrics, dress casual, more choice of our best premium essentials, more transitional products to become less weather dependent and all while we continue to cut the unproductive assortment tail.In consumer engagement, we just shot very strong cut-through campaigns for both Tommy and Calvin that we'll launch for Spring 2024. And in the marketplace, you will see us continue to invest in our stores, shop-in-shops and digital experiences to keep elevating the consumer experience.You can already see the positive effects of our next level PVH+ execution in our D2C channels, where we have more control between product and consumer and can execute with impact more quickly. And in wholesale, thanks to the much improved inventory management this season, despite the tougher conditions, you will already in Q4 be able to see a significantly improved profitability versus the same quarter last year.I have personally spent more time in Europe over the past few months. I visited over 50 stores in 6 countries to work with our teams as we adjust to market conditions and put the next level of PVH+ execution into action. Standing out the most from this work is the foundational strength we have in both brands with consumers across the region and the opportunity to continue leveraging this as we navigate the current environment.Moving on to Asia Pacific. We continue to drive strong performance, which included double-digit constant currency growth in our direct-to-consumer businesses across the region, including China. We continue to win in key consumer moments such as Chinese Valentine's Day and Tmall membership day, fueled by strong hero products and successful capsule launches. And both Calvin and Tommy continue to move up to rankers on Tmall.Most recently, we delivered double-digit growth in GMV during China's important 11-11 activation. Leading with a product category offers, we focused on growing live stream sales and leveraging talent in innovative and engaging ways. We also captured market share on Douyin as consumers increase spending on these newer formats of shopping. We leveraged our global mega talent to expand brand awareness in the region. In October, Calvin celebrated fall 2023 collection in Tokyo, featuring brand ambassador Jung Kook, the ventral strong brand awareness across the region and globally. And Tommy's fall campaign reached a total fan base of over 130 million with regionally relevant ambassadors, including K-pop group Stray Kids, in addition to new ambassadors, Li Qin and Greg Hsu, who drove over 430 million impressions in China alone during the campaign period.Overall, we are doing a great job executing the PVH+ Plan in the region, and we are very optimistic of the long-term growth opportunity for both of our brands.In closing, I feel very good about the strong performance we delivered in the quarter and how we keep gaining traction through our brand-building PVH+ execution.Before I turn the call over to Zac, I would like to thank all of our associates around the world for their hard work and important contributions this year. And I wish everyone a happy and healthy holiday season."", 'Zachary James Coughlin', ""Thanks, Stefan, and good morning. My comments are based on non-GAAP results and are reconciled in our press release. As Stefan discussed, we are pleased with our results for the quarter, driven by our iconic brands and disciplined execution of the PVH+ Plan. We continue to build on our track record of performance, delivering our top line guidance while exceeding bottom line guidance as we compete to win in this highly dynamic global environment.We delivered revenue growth of 4% on a reported basis and 1% on a constant currency basis, in line with our guidance with significant strength in DTC and in spite of an increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment, especially in Europe. On the bottom line, we once again exceeded our earnings guidance with earnings per share of $2.90, driven by strong expense management. We delivered operating margin of 10.5% for the quarter, up 90 basis points versus last year, delivering on our commitment of sequential second half improvement.Also, importantly, our inventory at quarter end is down 19% compared to last year as we continue to proactively manage our inventory levels. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to end the year with inventory significantly lower than last year, with improvement to continue through 2024 as we make progress on our previously announced goal of a 25% reduction in inventory as a percentage of sales.We also completed the sale of our Heritage Brands intimate apparel business earlier this week for $160 million in cash, which was yet another important step as we accelerate our focus on our core global brands, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger. We plan to utilize approximately $150 million of net proceeds from the sale for share repurchases in 2023. This increases our planned share buybacks for the year to approximately $550 million compared to up to $400 million previously. We expect the sale to be slightly accretive to our operating margin in 2024. As we head into the fourth quarter, we see continued strength in our DTC business and also expect pressure in the wholesale business to continue. This is especially true in Europe as the macro environment continues to be challenging, exacerbated by record high temperatures in September, as Stefan discussed, causing retailers to take a cautious approach. This as well as the impact from the sale of our Heritage Brands intimate apparel business is reflected in our revised revenue outlook of 1% growth for the year on both a reported and constant currency basis. Our prior guidance was an increase of 3% to 4% as reported and 2% to 3% on a constant currency basis.On the bottom line, we are reaffirming our approximately 10% operating margin outlook and raising our non-GAAP EPS outlook for the year to a record high $10.45 compared to $10.35 previously, despite our lower revenue outlook, as we further strengthen our focus on driving profitable sales and disciplined cost management.I will now discuss third quarter results in more detail and then move on to our outlook. Revenue was up 4% for the quarter, which reflected a 3% positive impact from exchange. Third quarter revenue for our international businesses was up 1% on a constant currency basis. Revenue in our European business was up 1% in euros despite the increasingly challenging macroeconomic environment with mid-single-digit growth in the DTC business, partially offset by pressures in wholesale and an unseasonably warm start to the fall season. Revenues for Asia Pacific were up 1% on a constant currency and down 2% on a reported basis. Strong demand across the region drove low double-digit constant currency growth in the DTC business, which was largely offset by timing of wholesale shipments compared to last year.In North America, revenue for our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brand businesses combined grew 2% as we delivered another quarter of growth in both our retail stores and owned and operated e-commerce business with total DTC up low single digits. Our owned and operated e-commerce sales were up double digits for both brands again this quarter as the investments we have made in the platform and overall site experience continue to resonate with consumers.Wholesale sales for our Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein brand businesses combined in North America were also up low single digits. Although retailers continue to take a cautious approach, retail sales trends improved sequentially compared to the second quarter, particularly at Macy's as we focus on driving sell-through and healthy inventory across the channel. Importantly, our quality of sales is improving significantly in North America as we grow that business. Gross margins were up over 500 basis points with increases across both brands and all channels.Looking at our overall third quarter revenue from a channel perspective, we continue to drive strong performance across all regions in our direct-to-consumer business. Our total DTC revenue was up 6% on a constant currency basis and up 8% on a reported basis in the quarter and up approximately 150 basis points as a percentage of our total revenue compared to last year. We delivered another quarter of strong growth in both our stores and our owned and operated e-commerce business with constant currency revenues up 4% and 12%, respectively, compared to last year.Total wholesale revenue was down 3% on a constant currency basis for the reasons I previously outlined. On a reported basis, wholesale revenue was up 1%. Our Global Brands delivered another solid quarter with Calvin Klein revenues up 6% and Tommy Hilfiger revenues up 4% as reported. On a constant currency basis, revenue for Calvin Klein was up 3%, and Tommy Hilfiger was flat as macroeconomic challenges impacting Europe weigh more heavily on the Tommy business. Importantly, our DTC business was up in both brands and in all regions.In the third quarter, we delivered gross margin of 56.7%, an increase of 80 basis points compared to last year despite a 100 basis point negative impact to product costs due to exchange. Gross margin reflects a significant favorable shift in mix with our higher gross margin DTC and international businesses making up a larger portion of total revenue and a favorable impact from lower ocean freight rates compared to last year.SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue for the third quarter was better than planned at 46.2% and flat versus the prior year. We continue to take a disciplined approach to managing expenses while making targeted investments to drive the PVH+ Plan, including a nearly 20% increase in marketing compared to last year to fund cut through brand campaigns. These investments and the impact of the shift in mix to our DTC and international businesses were offset by an approximately 150 basis point improvement in expenses versus last year due to savings realized from the actions we have taken to reduce people costs and prudent management of expenses. In total, EBIT for the quarter was $249 million, exceeding our expectations. Operating margin was 10.5% and expanded 90 basis points compared to last year despite the 100 basis point negative impact of exchange on our gross margin. And importantly, our operating margin for the quarter reflects a significant improvement in our North America business to 13.1% for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein combined.Earnings per share increased 12% to $2.90 compared to $2.60 in last year's third quarter and exceeded our guidance by $0.20, driven by the improvement in EBIT. Our tax rate for the quarter was approximately 22%.And now moving on to our outlook. Starting with the fourth quarter. We are projecting fourth quarter revenue to decline 3% to 4% compared to last year on both a reported and constant currency basis with projected strong high single-digit growth in our direct-to-consumer businesses more than offset by a decline in wholesale revenue, including the revenue reduction from the sale of the Heritage Brands intimate apparel business. Excluding the sale, the decline in wholesale revenue is mostly in Europe, where the wholesale revenues are projected to be down approximately 15% versus last year. Approximately 2/3 of that decrease is due to onetime shipment timing differences compared to last year when supply chains were still normalizing and about 1/3 is due to a decrease in sales to lower-margin accounts as we remain focused on quality of sales. Looking forward, as Stefan mentioned, we do expect the tough macros to continue into 2024.As a result, and combined with our continued focus on quality of sales, we now expect lower sell-in for wholesale next year with a higher quality sell-through. The benefit to the fourth quarter from the 53rd week in 2023 to our overall revenue is mostly offset by the revenue reduction from the sale of the Heritage Brands' intimate apparel business.While fourth quarter revenue is projected to be lower than last year, importantly, profitability is expected to be significantly higher. EBIT is expected to increase over 30% compared to last year, and operating margin is expected to expand to approximately 12%, up nearly 350 basis points compared to last year. And importantly, Europe profit has planned up significantly as well with regional margin up over 500 basis points versus last year and close to all-time highs.The overall increase in operating margin is almost entirely due to an approximately 400 basis point improvement in gross margin. The improvement is comprised of an approximately 150 basis point benefit due to a favorable shift in channel and regional mix, approximately 125 basis point improvement in freight expense and approximately 125 basis point improvement due to the raw material costs for spring '24 product being significantly lower. We expect all of these impacts to carry forward beyond the end of 2023.We also expect a modest increase in SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue in the fourth quarter compared to last year, with the higher expenses of DTC, mostly offset by the significant efficiencies we're driving in spending. Our fourth quarter earnings per share is projected to be approximately $3.45, up approximately 45% compared to $2.38 in the prior year, driven almost entirely by higher EBIT due to the significant profitability improvement. Our tax rate for the fourth quarter is estimated at approximately 22% and interest expense is projected to be approximately $25 million.And now bringing that all together for the full year 2023. As I mentioned, we are updating our full year revenue outlook and now project revenue to increase by approximately 1% on both a reported and constant currency basis. We are reaffirming our operating margin guidance for the year of approximately 10% and raising our non-GAAP EPS guidance by $0.10 to approximately $10.45, up 16% compared to 2022 and a record high for PVH. Regionally, our full year revenue outlook for North America for Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein combined is unchanged. But our overall outlook for the region is now planned down mid-single digits compared to down low single digits previously, due entirely to the impact from the sale of the Heritage Brands' intimate apparel business. Our outlook for Asia Pacific on a constant currency basis is also unchanged, planned up mid-teens. While on a reported basis, our revenue outlook for Asia Pacific has been negatively impacted by exchange, with growth on a reported basis now planned up high single digits compared to up low teens previously. In Europe, we are now planning full year revenue approximately flat in euros compared last year. This compares to our prior guidance of up low single digits in euros. Our DTC business in Europe continued to be planned up mid-single digits, but is mostly offset by a decrease in wholesale versus last year given the macroeconomic challenges I mentioned earlier. On a reported basis, Europe was planned up low single digits compared to up mid-single digits previously.We continue to expect our full year gross margin rate to increase over 100 basis points compared to 2022, despite approximately 100 basis points of higher cost due to exchange. As we've indicated previously, the improvement in our gross margin reflects an approximately 100 basis point benefit from a favorable shift in mix and approximately 100 basis points of improvement due to lower freight costs.We also continue to expect that SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue for the full year will increase approximately 70 basis points compared to 2022 with our investments in DTC and mix of international business driving higher expenses. Additionally, as I've discussed in prior quarters, we continue to invest in key areas that drive growth, including increased marketing with our full year target continuing to be approximately 6% of revenue. These impacts are partially offset by cost efficiencies, primarily due to the people cost actions we have taken. As a reminder, in the third quarter, we completed our targeted 10% people cost reduction with annual savings ahead of our targeted $100 million of savings.Our full year operating margin projection continues to be approximately 10% and continues to reflect high single-digit EBIT growth. Interest expense is projected to be approximately $93 million versus approximately $100 million previously, and we continue to expect our tax rate will be approximately 22%.Before we open up for questions, I want to reiterate that we are pleased with our third quarter results. We continue to work relentlessly to drive results. And as Stefan talked about earlier, we are laser-focused on delivering our commitments by executing the 5 key growth drivers of the PVH+ Plan, bringing together the consumer-facing value drivers of product, consumer engagement and marketplace with our underlying operating engines to deliver consistent results in a systematic and repeatable way.And with that, operator, we would like to open it up to questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Bob Drbul with Guggenheim.', 'Robert Scott Drbul', 'Great progress in North America this quarter, especially around the profitability. Can you just walk us through how we should think about the trajectory of North America going forward?', 'Stefan Larsson', ""Thank you, Bob. Yes, North America was really the standout this quarter. And it's really the results coming from the PVH+ focus we put forward over a year ago and the team coming into place and really building the brands and driving the business to win more with the domestic consumer. So you see the strength in products. So the category offense and the hero products is working. And you see it in gross margin rate going up, pricing power going up. Tommy, as an example, the best essentials, the premium essentials is up 50% versus last year. Calvin, fall essentials, much more, much better essentials in the line, much better sell-through much higher AUR. So you see product strength continue to cut through and really resonate well with the consumer. And you will continue to see sequential improvements on that.Consumer engagement when it comes to both Calvin and Tommy, the cut-through campaigns with the relevant talent amplification is really working. So you see the improved product amplified by strong talent and the strong cut-through campaigns, whether it's Jung Kook, Hailey Bieber, Kendall Jenner, Lewis Hamilton, George Russell, SZA, Damson Idris. We're starting to consistently execute on the PVH+ growth driver in terms of strengthening products, strengthening consumer engagement.And then it's the marketplace and execution. So really well done by the team indeed to see both stores and e-commerce, much stronger executed. You will see the consumer experience elevated. And then as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, our focus on getting closer to our best wholesale partners is really yielding strong results. So Macy's is a great example, where we are working very closely in -- to start with test stores where we execute a stronger products, the better essentials, the better newness, better presentation. We co-fund more staffing and see the results is very, very strong and very encouraging. So looking at the results in North America and then how it trickles down to 13.1% operating margin, it just reinforces what we knew when we set out a PVH+ Plan is that when we lean into the iconic strength of these 2 beloved brands, Calvin and Tommy, and we execute in what Zac was just mentioning, systematic and repeatable way, then it really pays off. So you will see this continuously -- growth in North America, both in D2C and in wholesale."", 'Zachary James Coughlin', ""Yes. And I think -- Bob, it's a great question. We're really proud of North America. North America EBIT margin of 13%. That's up 800 basis points versus last year. And what's exciting is it's really all elements of the business. Revenue was up with significant improvement in DTC. Gross margin was a big driver, up 600 basis points with better inventory, improved assortments and the beginnings of some of those macros turning to tailwinds. And SG&A percent also down as the work on head count efficiency is taking shape. So a great quarter.Looking forward, we'll work through the normal quarter-to-quarter profit fluctuations, but we do expect full year profitability this year for North America to land into the high single-digit operating margin range with a much better second half than first half. And so we think we -- this shows a clear path to the low teens for a full year that we committed by 2025 in the PVH+ Plan."", 'Stefan Larsson', ""And this -- just to build on what Zac was saying here, this is on top of quite a tough macro in North America as well. So we see that we're able to tap into the strength of the brands and the consumer love for the brands by the better product engagement and marketplace execution despite the tough macro. So very encouraged by that, most recently by the strength in the start of the holiday. So Black Friday, which has now become Black Friday week, Thanksgiving week -- weeks we delivered stronger start than planned for both Calvin and Tommy in North America."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI.', 'Michael Charles Binetti', ""Congrats on the next quarter and a really tough macro. Stefan, I want to ask you a little bit more specifically about some of the initiatives David Savman is putting in on the ground as he's working on supply chain and inventory maybe within the context of the 25% reduction in the inventory to sales ratio that you talked about that's going to keep going for the next 5 quarters, I think. What are some of the examples of work that he's doing that's really starting to land already? And then Zac, the 12% operating margin in fourth quarter, that's very, very different. I think the margins in the fourth quarter have been high single digits in the past. So you're way above that. It seems like a new level. How should we think about margins after '23 through the lens of what looks like a step change in the business in the fourth quarter?And maybe you could frame the 15% margin target you spoke about for 2025 at the Analyst Day. I know you joined the company maybe 20 minutes before that target went out. So now you had some time to think about it, maybe we can get some perspective on it."", 'Stefan Larsson', ""All right. Thanks, Michael. Let's start with the first question on the progress of the demand-driven supply chain. And seeing what David has been able to do with his team in a very short period of time is really encouraging. So what's happening?So you know that last quarter, we set out the long-term target by end of 2024 to drive down inventory in relation to sales with 25%. While improving availability, that's a key part. And what we see already now is inventory in great shape, probably the best shape we have ever had it, minus 18% versus last year with improved availability. So if we start on how that is possible. Much better, much more focused planning upfront, the assortment planning. So I keep speaking about the demand-driven supply chain based on my experience, always starts with supply chain coming in upfront with the product teams, better assortment planning upfront. And there, we are just starting to leverage that.But that is part of why we can run minus 18% in inventory with better availability. What you also see is that AUC is coming down. So if we look at the first half of 2024, AUC will come down with more than 5%. And this is not just sitting there writing the macros. The macros are favorable. On top of that, we're driving significant improvement, with improved raw material management. So we get better fabric, more competitive fabric, higher quality for the consumer at a lower cost.Better costing process, better discipline in the costing process, more data-driven. We have a better and more sharp assortment productivity. So we -- given that we build the assortment now with a very strong intent of starting with the best must-have essentials, we should always have Calvin and Tommy through to their DNAs. Each of their DNAs, the best must-have essentials in the market. That's what we are working. So we've build assortment from that, then we make sure we have the appropriate newness and then we can continue to cut the unproductive assortment tail.So what you see is really a multitude of efforts that are starting to gain traction. But it's been faster than what we expected. And you will see us just continue to deliver sequential improvements."", 'Zachary James Coughlin', ""Yes. And Michael, on the 4Q operating margin, we're expecting around 12% operating margin for the quarter compared to 8.6% last year, like you said, sort of high single digits. That's up, let's just say, 350 basis points, just to give us some composition of that. 125 basis points of that is really the full realization of the freight improvements, both rate and because of great availability, lower reliance on air freight. So that sort of booked. 125 basis points is tied to improvements in product costs. And I think as Stefan said, one, yes, macros are moving from negative to positive as raw materials are coming down. But also David Savman and the team are consistently now beating macros, and that will be trends that carry forward into '24 as well.And the last major driver of that is really the full impact, about 125 basis points of the headcount reductions we've taken on SG&A. So as we look forward into 2024, obviously, we're not providing guidance there. But I think you can look at the composition of that gross margin improvement, those are all factors that are now in place, either structurally or from an external marketplace perspective. And so we do expect to see those to carry forward fully into 2024.And to your question on the targets, as I stood on the stage shorter to Stefan on the leadership team, those are my commitments as well as anyone else. And I think that we've talked about the 15% being that bar that we're going to set for ourselves regardless of what's happening in the macro environment. I think this 12% for the third -- for the fourth quarter is a clear view of that because as Stefan to talk about, there's some choppy macros now and still driving to that. And we expect to continue to drive that through to 2024 as well as that next step towards the 2025 targets."", 'Stefan Larsson', ""Yes. And coming back, Michael, one more thing when it comes to the inventory, better inventory, demand-driven supply chain, what I see happening that I want to share as well is that having Eva Serrano come in and build the strength in the global product engine in Calvin, and now Lea Rytz Goldman coming in for Tommy, both highly experienced brand builders and very strong in product, you have that David Savman and his team's work upfront with them on leveraging that strength in products. So it's the connection between the increased strength we are driving in our 2 global brands, with the supply chain expertise that David brings in, plus the regional execution.So we are putting -- the supply chain is at the core, working with the global brands and the regions. And that's -- when you see -- again, it feels like Eva has been here for a long time, but she has only been here since the first half of this year. And you can see the spring assortment 2024 slightly improved by -- slightly affected by you will see improvements coming in by Eva fall much more improvement and then it just keeps going from there. So I'm very pleased by seeing how the team is coming together and breaking this old-school sequential handover way of working and breaking it down and starting up front working together cross-functionally. And that's whether it's the early days of building H&M or the Old Navy turnaround or the repositioning of RAP, that's always when I've seen that happening, that's where the value over time will increase."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Matthew Boss with JPMorgan.', 'Matthew Robert Boss', 'So tow-part question. Stefan, could you just elaborate on underlying demand trends for Tommy and Calvin in Europe? Maybe if we parse through some of this near-term noise, which sounds like it was weather related? And then for Zac, just maybe on sensitivity, could you just help lay out given all of the self-help drivers and the uncertain backdrop from a revenue perspective? Could you see operating margin expansion next year in a scenario of maybe flat revenues? Or just what would that picture look like?', 'Stefan Larsson', ""Yes. Thanks, Matt. Let me start. So if we look at Europe and the underlying demand trends for Calvin and Tommy is still being strong. Look at Q3 -- so when we look at Q3, we continue to grow on a record quarter in Europe last year, low single-digit growth on a record quarter last year. And that growth was on a very strong base. So 25% up versus pre-pandemic. And then you see another to the demand growth in Europe is the strong D2C growth despite a tough macro. And then what happened in the macro was in September, we had the warmest start of the fall since the -- no, 1800 -- 1880 or something like that. So of course, impacting September. We came back and the market came back in October from a demand trend perspective, but driving -- given the importance of September, an increasingly promotional environment in the market. And we see over the Q3, we see an increasingly cautious macro backdrop in Europe and with the biggest impact on the wholesale channel.So what we are doing there, we're not sitting still. We are leaning into the PVH+ execution in 2 ways -- 2 main ways. First, with a macro, my experience is when the macro gets tougher, it's really important to focus on quality of sales. So we are increasing the focus on quality of sales, even to Zac's point, if that means selling less in to the wholesale channel, but securing a strong sell-out margin, and avoiding too much inventory in the market. So that's the first action we take.The second is really leaning into the next level of PVH+ execution. PVH+ execution makes a big difference, independently on macro, but especially in tough macro. So a few examples I gave in terms of the product strength that we are driving in 2024, product innovation, whether it's technical components, fabrics, whether it's more choice of our premium essentials, more transitional products. We see that. It seems like every season now seems to start with an unusual weather situation. We can -- we can sit back and say, okay, or we lean in the way we do, which is say, okay, clear. We have to do more transitional products. And that you will see already in 2024.Then in consumer engagement, having in a tough macro having market-leading brands, is a huge advantage. And the way we take advantage of that consumer engagement wise is twofold, just shot 2 very strong marketing campaigns for spring 2024, with mega talent amplifying the improved product strength. So -- and then in the marketplace, what's also going to be important is to continue to invest in the consumer experience. So you will see that in investment in our stores, investments in shop-in-shop in the digital experience. So overall, we are in a tough macro in Europe leveraging better the strength, the market-leading strength we have for Tommy in particularly in Europe, and then we have the strength of having one of the biggest growth brands in Europe in Calvin."", 'Zachary James Coughlin', ""Yes. And I think just to add some color to Stefan's comments about just how disruptive the September heat wave was in Europe, we can look at our own DTC sales. We don't typically provide intra-quarter numbers, but I think it's really important context. Coming out of summer, our August DTC revenue was up 10% in Europe. Then the heat wave hit in September, right as us and all of our competitors were setting fall season and sales were down 7% in September. Then in October, things have recovered to being up 10%, but in a significantly more promotional environment. So in our DTC channels, we can move more quickly. The economics of our wholesalers more difficult. And so we see that coming through with regard to a more cautious sell-in outlook that they're putting into place, and we're preparing for that potential to carry forward in 2024. But I think what's important is that readiness shows up in profitability.Even with a lower European revenue outlook for 4Q, we expect European profit to be up over 30% versus last year in the fourth quarter. So I think that ability to manage profitability moving into 2024 remains full. I think to answer your question on 2024 around managing operating margin in a potential flat environment, absolutely. Our commitment is to deliver on our operating margin commitments regardless of where the top line is. And I think we can look no further than 4Q for our success in doing that right now, and we'd expect for that success to carry forward into the to 2024 as well."", 'Stefan Larsson', ""And just building on what Zac was saying here because across the world in all our regions in a tough macro, we have the strength of having in Calvin and Tommy, two of the most iconic beloved brands in the marketplace. And we have the brand building plan in PVH+ and we gain increased traction when we lean into the PVH+ execution. So from that, you will see continuously that what's within our control, we will continue to improve step by step by step. And the margin is the most in our control. That's why you hear the confidence from Zac."", 'Operator', 'Our next question will come from Jay Sole with UBS.', 'Jay Daniel Sole', ""Stefan, I wanted to follow up on your comments about the success you're seeing at Macy's. If you can connect that to the transition that's ongoing with G-III, does it -- the success you're seeing makes you -- give you the confidence that you're building the teams and the capabilities to be able to replace those revenues that G-III currently has within PVH as the transition continues and continue to build a big business and really capture all that opportunity that's out there financially as that transition takes place?"", 'Stefan Larsson', ""Thank you, Jay. Great question. Yes, very encouraged by the progress we are seeing with Macy's. And this is also building on my experience being part of repositioning Ralph for sustainable growth. A number of years back, we did exactly the same thing. We partnered with Macy's and made sure that Macy's became our best full price expression, and that's what we are doing. And we are doing it in our own-controlled men's and underwear today and both Calvin and Tommy, and it's really working out. And it's the same confidence we have when it comes to taking back the licenses over the multiyear period with G-III. We are already working on making sure that the product strength -- the category offense is there, the product strength is there and the pricing is there. So yes, equally confident when it comes to men's and women's and the strength of Calvin and Tommy with the Macy's consumer. We are early on in doing a very deep consumer and brand study globally. But when we start to break that down into North America and in Macy's, we see the incredible strength that both Calvin and have -- Calvin and Tommy has with the Macy's consumer.So an incredible awareness in very strong consideration and very strong brand love. So we have all the pieces in place from the consumer love for our brands and putting all the pieces in place for successfully taking back the licenses. So very encouraged."", 'Operator', 'And that question will come from Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.', 'Dana Lauren Telsey', ""Nice to see the progress. Just continuing on the thought of the wholesale business, which is so important in the progress that you've made in America, as you mentioned with Macy's, during this time period in Europe where the macro is more a little bit more challenging. Are there relationship enhancements or business enhancements that are being done on the wholesale side in Europe that can mirror North America? And are there partners like Macy's that you see as dominant in Europe is what you see here in North America? Just can put some color on the wholesale in Europe and that potential."", 'Stefan Larsson', ""Thank you, Dana. It's also an important question. So we have market-leading strength in Europe and very strong partnership with the strongest wholesale retailers. And when I look back at the past few months, when I referenced seeing 50 -- over 50 stores and doors in 5, 6 countries also met with key partners like Peak & Cloppenburg, Zalando. So very much focused on the same thing, next-level PVH+ execution.So to your point, there is the strength in the brands and the consumer love is unprecedented for us in Europe. And then the strength when we lean into essentials and we build out choices of our best essentials must-haves in the market when we have the right newness when we have the right cut-through campaigns, when we partner with our wholesalers to amplify that with the strength in products, strength and talent and strength that the retailers have, it's very encouraging.So overall -- thank you, Dana. So overall, thank you very much for joining our call today. As you can hear from us, we feel very strong about the increased traction we get on the PVH+ Plan. We recognize the tough macro we are navigating. We also recognize the strength that we have in our hands with these 2 very strong brands. The plan and the execution strength that comes out of that plan that we are just in the beginning of tapping into. So looking forward to catching up next quarter on the progress that we will be relentless in driving. And then ahead of that, I just wish everybody a really happy holiday. Thank you."", 'Operator', ""This does conclude today's PVH Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.""]"

The markets were pressed by uncertainty owing to the Fed’s stance to hold interest rates steady while keeping the door ajar for another hike before the end of the year.However, the markets were back on the growth trajectory on the following day as bond yields dipped. The uptrend was further buoyed by the latest consumer confidence report, which revealed that U.S. consumer confidence rose in November to 102.0 after three straight monthly declines. The data showed that consumers were likely to spend more in the near term on signs that inflation was abating.The rise in buying intentions portrays the strength in the economy and steady labor market conditions, with Americans planning big-ticket purchases like motor vehicles and houses over the next six months. The latest GDP data also reveal that the economy grew in the third quarter at a stronger-than-forecast annual rate of 5.2%.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. NRG Energy, Inc. NRG, Thomson Reuters Corporation TRI, Iron Mountain Incorporated IRM, Cboe Global Markets, Inc. CBOE and Arch Capital Group Ltd. ACGL are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.', 'ROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.', ""In order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.\xa0 \xa0Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 11 stocks that qualified the screening:NRG Energy: Headquarters in Houston, TX, NRG Energy is engaged in the production, sale and delivery of energy and energy products and services to residential, industrial as well as commercial consumers in major competitive power markets in the United States.

The LAA, a small pouch in the left atrium of the heart, is a major source of blood clots in AFib patients that can enter the bloodstream and cause a stroke.', 'The high-growth market for LAA closure devices is led by Boston Scientific’s Watchman franchise and includes Abbott’s Amplatzer Amulet and AtriCure’s AtriClip devices. Medtronic on Monday joined the field, announcing it is launching an implantable clip called Penditure that it acquired from Syntheon.', 'While J&J will need to catch up with those devices already on the market, the company is looking to differentiate itself with an offering that uses rotational motion to eliminate the LAA. J&J said Laminar has received Food and Drug Administration approval for a U.S. pivotal study of the device that will begin enrollment early next year.', 'J&J noted that nearly 40% of AFib patients cannot tolerate long-term blood thinners, which is driving the market for LAA closure devices.

The company's global presence and diversified product portfolio provide a solid foundation for future growth.

The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Mosaic investors that purchase the stock on or after the 6th of December will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 21st of December."", ""The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.20 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed US$0.80 to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Mosaic has a trailing yield of 2.2% on the current share price of $35.89. If you buy this business for its dividend, you should have an idea of whether Mosaic's dividend is reliable and sustainable. As a result, readers should always check whether Mosaic has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Mosaic ', 'Dividends are usually paid out of company profits, so if a company pays out more than it earned then its dividend is usually at greater risk of being cut. Mosaic has a low and conservative payout ratio of just 20% of its income after tax. That said, even highly profitable companies sometimes might not generate enough cash to pay the dividend, which is why we should always check if the dividend is covered by cash flow. It paid out 23% of its free cash flow as dividends last year, which is conservatively low.', ""It's encouraging to see that the dividend is covered by both profit and cash flow. This generally suggests the dividend is sustainable, as long as earnings don't drop precipitously."", ""Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends."", ""Companies with consistently growing earnings per share generally make the best dividend stocks, as they usually find it easier to grow dividends per share. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. That's why it's comforting to see Mosaic's earnings have been skyrocketing, up 51% per annum for the past five years. With earnings per share growing rapidly and the company sensibly reinvesting almost all of its profits within the business, Mosaic looks like a promising growth company."", ""Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Mosaic has seen its dividend decline 2.2% per annum on average over the past 10 years, which is not great to see. Mosaic is a rare case where dividends have been decreasing at the same time as earnings per share have been improving. It's unusual to see, and could point to unstable conditions in the core business, or more rarely an intensified focus on reinvesting profits."", ""Is Mosaic worth buying for its dividend? Mosaic has grown its earnings per share while simultaneously reinvesting in the business. Unfortunately it's cut the dividend at least once in the past 10 years, but the conservative payout ratio makes the current dividend look sustainable. It's a promising combination that should mark this company worthy of closer attention."", ""So while Mosaic looks good from a dividend perspective, it's always worthwhile being up to date with the risks involved in this stock.

ERJ recently clinched a firm order from Porter Airlines for delivering 25 of its E195-E2 passenger jets. The fresh order enhances Embraer’s current 50 firm orders from this Canadian carrier, broadening its fleet with this aircraft.', 'The agreement, priced at $2.1 billion at list price, will contribute to ERJ’s Q4 backlog and increase Porter’s firm orders with Embraer to a total of 75, with 24 jets already being delivered to the company.', 'The steady stream of orders for Embraer’s E195-E2 jets underscores its effective ability to meet the growing jet demand of airlines.', ""The largest aircraft in Embraer’s E-Jet E2 family, the E195-E2, has been designed to maximize returns and efficiency on high-density routes. It is also considered to be the world's quietest and most fuel-efficient single-aisle aircraft."", 'With its high-aspect-ratio wings and swept tips, combined with other aerodynamic improvements, the E195-E2 achieves double-digit lower fuel consumption compared to current-generation E-Jets.', 'Due to such remarkable features, Embraer could witness a steady inflow of orders for the jet in the days ahead as well. This will bolster its revenue generation prospects.', 'The demand for air travel remains solid and continues to rise. Per the report released by the International Air Transport Association (“IATA”) in September 2023, total air traffic in September 2023 (measured in revenue passenger kilometers or RPKs) increased 30.1%, while global traffic stood at 97.3% of pre-COVID-19 levels.', 'The RPK can be expected to improve, considering the rise in travel demand for both domestic and international traveling. Per the data from IATA, domestic September 2023 traffic rose 28.3% from the September 2022 level, while international traffic climbed 31.2% compared to September 2022, with all markets witnessing significant growth.', 'Going forward, per the report from Allied Market Research, the global commercial aircraft market is expected to witness a CAGR of 4.2% over the 2021-2030 period. This entails significant demand for commercial jets in the days ahead, which brightens the prospects of aircraft manufacturers to shine in the northward-bound market.', 'In such a scenario, ERJ’s efforts to provide upgraded aircraft that ensure sustainability and fuel efficiency are likely to result in significant order wins for the company, like the latest one. Consequently, Embraer’s backlog at the end of the third quarter was $17.8 billion compared with $17.3 billion at the end of the second quarter of 2023. Such solid backlog strength of the company should enable it to eventually recognize significant revenue growth once the deliveries are made.', 'Other companies that stand to benefit from the growing commercial aircraft market are Airbus SE EADSY, Textron TXT and Boeing BA.', 'Airbus is one of the forerunners in the commercial aircraft segment. Its order backlog amounted to 7,992 commercial aircraft at the end of September 2023.', 'Airbus’ long-term earnings growth rate is pegged at 12.4%. Shares of EADSY have returned 30.3% value to its investors in the past year.', 'Boeing has been the premier manufacturer of commercial jetliners for decades.

""We are a unique institute that is designed to be a hub, a facilitator, that brings researchers, clinicians, and institutes all across Ontario together to solve the cancer problem.""', ""Precision medicine is the key. Radvanyi and his team understand that every patient's cancer is unique, and to treat each person effectively, they must identify the genetic variations that drive their disease and tailor treatments in response."", '""Our goal is to be highly translational,"" says Radvanyi. ""We want to pick the discoveries and innovations we believe can move into the clinic and can also lead to a new generation of products. We intersect these efforts by also facilitating the application of these innovations by new startup biotech companies in Ontario.""', ""Discovery and clinical care Bernard Lam, PhD, is associate director of OICR's Translational Genomics Lab, which features a fully equipped genomic sequencing facility, including two recently acquired high-capacity NovaSeq X Plus Systems representing the latest in next-generation sequencing technology. The lab is different from most fundamental discovery facilities because it also offers assays to support patient care through clinical trials."", '""We have a clear goal of generating clinically relevant data that can be used in basic research or to inform individualized medicines for patients,"" says Lam, whose lab works with several institutions across Ontario. ""Our common goal is to get this done in a timely manner at the highest possible quality. We have clinical assays that can be reported back within a few weeks. Patients are waiting for a decision, and we can provide information to help guide their treatment.""', ""Just across the street from OICR, clinicians at one of OICR's partner organizations, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PMCC), are urgently looking for new ways to help their patients. Stephanie Lheureux, MD, PhD, is a clinical investigator at PMCC who focuses on gynecologic malignancies. Lheureux relies on OICR for whole-genome and transcriptome data to guide treatment and/or monitor disease progression as part of clinical trials."", '""Now we can go deeper, to the molecular level, and really differentiate subgroups of ovarian cancer that we treat differently,"" says Lheureux, ""and we\'re doing the same investigations with uterine and cervical cancers. This changes how we practice and how we treat patients, because the different subtypes of each cancer do not respond the same ways to standard treatments.""', ""Lheureux is also part of PMCC's drug development program, which leverages clinical trials to find options beyond standard chemotherapy. Genomic profiling provides a crucial layer of information, identifying variations that spur cell growth or drug resistance."", '""OICR is a great collaborator,"" Lheureux says. ""As we do clinical trials, we often try to understand why patients may respond, or not, to a treatment. Sometimes we don\'t know how a specific patient will respond; we have no clinical information to guide us. Having access to genomic sequencing gives us another tool that could give us new insights into why a patient might benefit from a treatment.""', 'The need for speed Genomic information can be useful for clinical care-but only if it arrives quickly. Cancer does not wait. ""Molecular profiling can provide additional information, but if the results take too long, that may not be helpful,"" Lheureux says. ""We need these results in a timely fashion to really guide treatment.""', 'Fortunately, current Illumina sequencers are fast. Ten years ago, HiSeq took several days to deliver results. Early NovaSeq Systems trimmed that to 48 hours. NovaSeq X Plus takes around 24 hours.', '""You can literally come back the next day and your data is ready,"" says Lam. ""Having two NovaSeq X Pluses in the lab is quite amazing because it\'s equivalent to six NovaSeq 6000s. Those capabilities are having an immediate impact on our sequencing capacity.""', 'These added capabilities could change the economics of genomic sequencing. Often, labs choose to do targeted sequencing. While this approach saves money, it could also leave out important information, such as noncoding regions that may still influence cancer. Less expensive next-generation sequencing could open a whole realm of applications.', '""I think we are getting to a time where fully sequencing the whole tumor genome can be used as a companion diagnostic for every patient,"" says Lam.', ""Lam is excited about other features, such as NovaSeq X's increased capacity and larger flow cells, particularly for population studies. OICR is part of the Marathon of Hope Cancer Centres Network and will sequence thousands of patient genomes. That data will be combined with other biomarkers and clinical data to drive new decision-making algorithms that could better select therapies."", '""There are so many things we can use genomics to study,"" says Lam. ""We also have projects where patients have inherited genes that drive cancer development, and we can use genomics to help monitor them throughout their lifetime, developing early cancer detection tools so we can catch these tumors fast and intercede.

This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock is also expected to gain from prudent growth strategies and accretive acquisitions.Yet, project delays, higher costs and cyclical nature of the business are major concerns.Nonetheless, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings per share (EPS) of $7.07 for 2023 and $8.35 for 2024 indicates 11.5% and 18.1% year-over-year growth, respectively.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'High Infrastructural Demand: Quanta is benefiting from its active participation in advancing and implementing technology solutions across the entire decarbonization spectrum. This encompasses activities related to carbon management, mitigation, compliance consulting, and the establishment of infrastructure supporting carbon-free energy solutions. Quanta Services has strategically positioned itself to leverage significant industry trends and take a prominent role in the ongoing energy transition, fostering technological innovation. Notable initiatives, such as expanding electric vehicle charging infrastructure and the underground placement of electrical infrastructure, are gaining momentum and contributing to the success of Quanta Services.Solid Backlog Level: The company ended the third quarter of 2023 with a 12-month backlog of $17.02 billion and a total record backlog of $30.1 billion. This compares favorably with the December 2022-end’s 12-month backlog of $13.79 billion and the total backlog of $24.09 billion. The reported metrics were also up from the year-ago respective figures of $12.43 billion and $20.87 billion. This demonstrates the strength of its core operations. Quanta’s optimism stems from healthy backlog levels, which are expected to grow further.Quanta envisions delivering a 10% organic adjusted EPS compound annual growth rate (CAGR) and more than 15% adjusted EPS CAGR through 2026.Acquisitions: Quanta considers acquisitions to be a pivotal element of its strategy to augment its market presence and expand its order backlog. During the third quarter of 2023 earnings call, the company announced its successful acquisition of Pennsylvania Transformer Technology, or PTT, a manufacturer of power transformers and components for investor-owned electric utility, renewable energy, municipal power and industrial markets. The company believes that this strategic buyout will provide it and its clients with a crucial supply-chain solution that aligns with its strategy. In January 2023, Quanta completed the acquisition of three companies.', ""Margin Pressure: In the third quarter, the operating margin of the Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions unit contracted 40 basis points (bps) to 8.7%. This contraction was attributed to fluctuations in project timing overall and heightened cost absorption pressure, primarily stemming from increased fixed costs aimed at supporting the anticipated rise in project activity in the forthcoming period. Similarly, during the second quarter, the operating margin for this segment experienced an 85-bps contraction to 8% compared to the previous year. This decline was a result of escalated costs associated with the augmented resources required to facilitate the expected upsurge in project activity in the latter half of 2023 and extending into 2024.Business Cyclicality: The business exhibits a cyclical nature as the demand for Quanta's services is subject to fluctuations. Consequently, the company is particularly susceptible to declines in both government and private industrial expenditures.

(Operator Instructions) I will now turn the call over to Rodney."", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we begin, I'd like to take a moment to outline our discussion topics this morning. I will begin by covering the current retail environment and how the strength of Kroger's value creation model is supporting earnings growth and generating strong free cash flow. Then Gary will cover our financial results and guidance for the remainder of the year. Finally, I will conclude with an update on our proposed merger with Albertsons before we open it up for questions. Now turning to our third quarter. Kroger's third quarter results highlight the strength and diversity of our business model in a challenged operating environment, as strong fuel performance and growth in our alternative profit businesses supported continued adjusted net earnings per diluted share growth. As consumer spending tightens, we are focused on providing customers with exceptional value by maintaining our long-term commitment to lower prices, personalized promotions and rewards. We are growing households and increasing loyalty, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Customers are managing many economic factors that are pressuring their spending, including higher interest rates, reduced savings and fewer government benefits, including SNAP. Although inflation is decelerating, customers are still adjusting to the impacts from 8 consecutive quarters of broad and significant inflation. During the quarter, Kroger grew higher-income households once again as our attractive mix of quality, value and convenience continues to drive engagement. By buying larger packs, more fresh items and more premium Our Brand products, these households are more profitable. As we've seen over recent quarters, our customers are actively looking for value, and our budget-conscious customers are under more significant spending pressure. We are also looking for ways to support customers with additional value, including in-store displays with everyday staples at low price points. We've seen a great response from all customers to these offers. But engagement from our budget-conscious households has been especially strong. Customers purchasing these offer items are making more trips and buying more units, not only recognizing the value with these displays but the value across the entire store. To help more customers manage their budget, we are only deepening our commitment to deliver exceptional value for our customers. Our personalized promotions are an increasingly critical way for customers to save on items that matter most to them. We are applying analytics to Kroger's unmatched purchase data to strike the right balance between the depth and breadth of promotions. To ensure customers were able to enjoy a memorable Thanksgiving, for example, we created a meal bundle that served a group of 10 for less than $5 per person, which represents a lower price than last year. We have a long history of delivering value to our customers by providing a broad assortment of fresh foods at low prices. Through our unique omnichannel shopping experience, we've achieved our 10th consecutive quarter of total household growth and increased loyal households even faster, positioning Kroger for sustainable future growth. Now I'll provide more details about how our go-to-market strategy is delivering for our customers. Starting with Seamless. Our digital business delivered a strong third quarter with double-digit growth in both our pickup and delivery businesses. Multiple tailwinds are driving our sales momentum, including growth in both households and visits. Our new 2-hour pickup service available in more than 1/3 of our stores also contributed to our success in the quarter. To become the online food retailer of choice, we are focused on delivering best-in-class fulfillment. Our teams improved key customer experience metrics in pickup, increasing fill rates and reducing wait times during the quarter. This resulted in improved net promoter scores. Our customer fulfillment centers again led our delivery growth, where we continue to rapidly increase households. Our delivery customers enjoy the convenience of on-time refrigerated delivery directly to their doorstep with zero compromise on freshness, quality and value. Turning to personalization. Investments in our personalized capabilities ensure we are meeting elevated customer demand for savings and enables us to deploy promotional dollars more effectively. Digital offers have increased compared to last year, and our personalization capabilities have resulted in an even more significant increase in redemptions, driving loyalty and increasing digitally engaged households this quarter by 13%. Digitally engaged households are incredibly valuable to our model as they are more loyal, spend nearly 3x more with us and accelerate growth in our alternative profit businesses. Now I'd like to share more about how our diversified business model supported earnings growth this quarter and gives us confidence in our ability to navigate the environment ahead. Starting with our alternative profit businesses. Growth in alternative profit businesses remained strong in the third quarter with balanced growth across the portfolio. The strength of our Seamless ecosystem and elevated digital engagement is having a flywheel effect, creating the traffic and the data needed to drive growth in Kroger Precision Marketing, a higher margin profit stream. Recently, we celebrated the sixth anniversary of KPM. This quarter, KPM made an important step in its journey to become the most trusted and transparent media company. By activating ad buying platforms, we are offering more self-service solutions to meet clients where they are today, providing advertisers more direct access to custom Kroger audiences. This first iteration has already launched and KPM expects to expand to other buying platforms in the future. These new innovative features will help accelerate KPM's impressive growth by allowing advertisers to reduce waste and enhance measurement tools. Kroger Health had a strong quarter that exceeded our internal expectations and helped drive sales and profit growth. Our decision to terminate our agreement with Express Scripts reflects our commitment to making decisions that we believe are in the best long-term interest of our customers and shareholders. Our teams have done an excellent job retaining patients and utilizing our pharmacists' extra capacity to devote more time to patient care, including growing our number of vaccinations. Gary will provide more on the financial impact of this later. During the quarter, we continued to see rapid growth in GLP-1 drugs in our retail pharmacies. While the long-term impacts of these drugs on customer buying habits are unknown, Kroger's food-as-medicine philosophy positions us well to support our customers' health and wellness goals. Our comprehensive approach includes health care services, professional dietitians, and proprietary tools like our nutrition rating app, OptUp, which are all designed to support healthy living and to do so holistically. While we pride ourselves on data and insights, the patient data in our pharmacy operations is separate from our customer loyalty data and is protected by privacy laws. We are committed to using our data in an appropriate manner while not jeopardizing customers' trust. For now, we have not seen any major macro shifts in customer eating habits or spending behaviors. Food trends are constantly evolving, and we are committed to offering products that meet our customers' needs. For customers looking to adopt healthier habits with or without the help of these drugs, we are well positioned to provide important health care services and healthy food options. At Kroger, our purpose is to feed the human spirit. And I'm so impressed by the many ways our associates bring this to life every day and the ways they support our customers and each other. We know when associates are connected to our purpose, they feel connected to Kroger. Our annual Kroger Wellness Festival is just one example of living our purpose. This festival is one of the nation's largest health and wellness events, showcasing more than 150 experiences and food offerings. Sponsors and celebrities joined Kroger and hundreds of thousands of visitors to share our vision for better physical, mental and emotional health for families. It was wonderful to see the level of support and participation in this important mission. Also this quarter, we released our annual ESG report, which highlighted Kroger's significant progress on our Zero Hunger | Zero Waste journey, to expand access to affordable, fresh and healthy food and to reduce waste, especially food waste, across our footprint. Since we launched Zero Hunger | Zero Waste in 2017, Kroger has donated more than 3 billion meals to feed hungry families, including more than [1.3 billion] to fight food insecurity and nearly 600 million pounds of surplus food to our food bank partners. I am so proud of our teams and their efforts to reach these incredible milestones. Our associates are the driving force behind our success by delivering an outstanding customer experience and helping make the holidays even more special for our customers. We facilitate this through our long-standing commitment to invest in associate wages and benefits and training tools to advance their career growth. Feed Your Future, our continuing education benefit, is one of the important ways we make Kroger a place where associates come for a job and discover a career. This benefit provides up to $21,000 lifetime and has helped almost 6,000 associates this year alone, with approximately 90% of these participants being hourly. Our focus on development is contributing to strong improvements in retention, which includes associate continuity and a more consistent customer experience. With that, I'll turn it over to Gary to take you through our financial results. Gary?"", 'Gary Millerchip', ""Thank you, Rodney, and good morning, everyone. Kroger's third quarter results demonstrate the resilience of our value creation model. The investments we have made over recent years to strengthen and diversify our business are allowing Kroger to navigate a challenged environment characterized by tightening consumer spending and food-at-home disinflation. We achieved adjusted earnings per share growth of 8% this quarter while also providing greater value for our customers, higher wages for our associates and investing in strategic initiatives that will support future growth. This was made possible by our teams delivering strong performances across our margin expansion initiatives, fuel, alternative profit businesses and health and wellness. Our year-to-date results keep us on track to achieve adjusted earnings per share growth in 2023, building on record results over the prior 3 years.I'll now provide more detail on our third quarter. Identical sales without fuel decreased 0.6%. Underlying growth would have been positive 1%, adjusting for the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. Similar to the first 2 quarters of the year, the terminated agreement with Express Scripts had a positive effect on our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, and a negative effect on the OG&A rate, excluding fuel and adjustment items. The overall net effect on operating profit was slightly positive. As a reminder, we will begin to cycle the impact of Express Scripts at the start of the new calendar year.Turning back to identical sales without fuel. As Rodney shared earlier, our Seamless ecosystem is a critical component of our growth strategy, building customer loyalty and fueling our alternative profit businesses. Digital sales were a highlight in the quarter, growing 11%. Our overall sales continue to be affected by industry-wide disinflation. Inflation ended quarter 3 in the low single digits, approximately 270 basis points lower than the second quarter. Towards the end of the quarter, we saw inflation decline at a slower pace. We would expect this trend to continue in the fourth quarter with inflation remaining positive at the year-end.Encouragingly, units have shown signs of improvement as inflation has decelerated, and we have sequentially improved units for 4 straight quarters. However, unit growth rates have lagged the rate of inflation decline and have not improved at the pace we would have expected. As a team, we are laser-focused on returning to unit growth and expect improvement in volumes to continue for the balance of the year. Gross margin was 22% of sales, and our FIFO gross margin rate, excluding fuel, increased 3 basis points compared to the same quarter last year.During the quarter, we increased investments in pricing and promotions to deliver greater value for customers, and we were able to successfully fund these investments by continuing to execute our long-term margin improvement plan, including Our Brands optimization, sourcing efficiencies and supply chain improvements.Shrink was a headwind to gross margin during the quarter, primarily due to the continued rise in industry-wide theft and organized retail crime. We are investing in initiatives to mitigate shrink and protect our associates and customers in our stores. Looking ahead, we would expect these same factors that influenced gross margin in quarter 3 will drive a similar outcome for gross margin rate in the fourth quarter.During quarter 3, we recorded a LIFO charge of $29 million compared to a charge of $152 million for the same quarter last year. This reduction was due to inflation returning to low single digits compared to double-digit growth experienced last year. Kroger's OG&A rate increased 32 basis points, excluding fuel and adjustment items. The increase in OG&A rate was driven by planned investments in associate wages and benefits and the effect of our terminated agreement with Express Scripts. During the quarter, we also made the decision to invest in a number of strategic initiatives that are expected to drive growth in 2024 and beyond. Investments were partially offset by execution of cost saving initiatives and lower incentive plan costs. We are confident in our ability to effectively manage costs and continue to deliver savings by eliminating waste in areas that do not affect the customer experience. We continue to identify incremental cost saving opportunities across the business and remain on track to deliver our sixth consecutive year of $1 billion in cost savings. In the fourth quarter, we would expect our OG&A rate to be relatively flat compared to last year.Kroger Health is an important component of our value creation model and is delivering profitable growth in 2023. During the quarter, the team exceeded our internal goal for the number of vaccinations administered, and the higher profit margins associated with these vaccines helped offset the negative impact on margin rate from growth in GLP-1 drugs. As Rodney shared earlier, we are excited about the momentum in health and wellness and see significant potential for future profitable growth in this area of our business.Fuel is also a key part of our strategy and through our rewards program is another way that we deliver value for customers and increase loyalty. Our fuel team did an outstanding job delivering results that were ahead of expectations in the third quarter. Our customers saved 14% more in rewards per fuel purchased compared to last year, which led to gallon sales outpacing the industry. The average retail price of fuel was $3.77 this quarter versus $3.84 last year. And our cents per gallon fuel margin was $0.57 this quarter versus $0.50 last year.I'd now like to provide a brief update on labor relations. Kroger has made substantial investments over the last 5 years in our associates, raising the average hourly wage by more than 33%. We remain committed to supporting our associates with sustainable investments in wages and comprehensive benefits that will, at the same time, allow us to continue to keep products affordable for the communities that we serve. During the third quarter, we ratified new labor agreements with the UFCW for Fry's Food and Drug, Dallas Meat and 4 stores in Roundy's, in total covering more than 19,000 associates. We have now ratified all agreements that were scheduled for negotiation in 2023.Turning to liquidity and free cash flow. Kroger continues to generate strong free cash flow through consistent operating results and a disciplined approach to deploying capital, prioritizing the highest return opportunities that support our growth strategy and TSR model. At the end of the third quarter, Kroger's net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio was 1.4, which remains well below our net total debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio target range of 2.3 to 2.5. This positions us well to execute our financing strategy to close the proposed merger with Albertsons early in 2024 and then quickly return to within our target leverage range post-merger.As I wrap up my comments on the quarter, let me provide additional color on our outlook for the remainder of the year. Today, we updated our full year guidance to reflect the impact of near-term economic pressures and food-at-home disinflation. We now expect full year identical sales without fuel to be in the range of 0.6% to 1% and adjusted FIFO net operating profit to be within a range of $4.9 billion to $5 billion. As a reminder, our sales guidance reflects the effect of Express Scripts, which is reducing our reported identical sales without fuel by approximately 150 basis points in 2023.Our latest sales trends would put us on track to achieve the midpoint of our updated annual sales guidance range. Importantly, we would expect to exit quarter 4 with a stronger sales trend than our overall results for the quarter as we start to cycle the effect of Express Scripts in January. We believe we are well positioned to navigate near-term headwinds, and the strength we are seeing in our alternative profit businesses, health and wellness, and fuel, combined with a lower expected LIFO charge, gives us the confidence to raise the lower end of our full year adjusted net earnings per diluted share guidance range. We now expect adjusted EPS to be between $4.50 to $4.60. And looking forward, Kroger remains committed to delivering attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. I'll now turn the call back to Rodney."", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""Thanks, Gary. Before we open the floor to your questions, let me provide an update on our pending merger with Albertsons Companies. As of November 15, 2023, Kroger certified substantial compliance with the second request issued by the FTC. We continue to work cooperatively with the FTC in its review of the transaction. This step keeps us on track to close our proposed merger with Albertsons in early 2024. We are confident that we have fulfilled all the commitments we set out in the original merger agreement, including the comprehensive divestiture plan announced with C&S Wholesale Grocers. C&S is a well-qualified buyer who meets all the criteria necessary to complete our transaction and will ensure no stores will close as a result of the merger. Frontline associates will remain employed and existing collective bargaining agreements will continue.We have made a compelling case to both Kroger and Albertsons stakeholders. Our proposed merger with Albertsons creates meaningful and measurable benefits for our customers by lowering prices beginning on day 1, extends our commitment to associates by increasing wages and benefits and deepens trust with our communities by keeping stores open to assure America has access to fresh and affordable food.In terms of integration planning, we are progressing well. Our integration teams have made significant progress toward our first goal, which is to ensure continuity for associates and customers at closing. It is exciting to see the complementary strengths of both organizations and how we'll be able to learn from each other to provide customers with an even stronger food retail experience and compete even more effectively against larger nonunion operators in the future.In closing, Kroger delivered another quarter of solid results. We are demonstrating our ability to manage through a more challenged environment and remain committed to balancing our investments in our associates and in lower prices for our customers while continuing to generate attractive and sustainable returns for our shareholders. With that, Gary and I look forward to taking your questions."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question goes to Dean Rosenblum of Bernstein.', 'Dean Rosenblum', ""My question is really about a debate regarding the gross profit and operating profit impact of increasing digital sales. I mean, online was -- digital sales were up 11% this quarter on a total comp. Express Scripts of [1], which says it's growing share. Can you help us understand -- I know you think about it in terms of the whole digital ecosystem, including the alternative revenues. But in terms of the actual operating profit contribution from digital relative to the stores, can you help us understand how to think about that as that mix continues to increase?"", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""If you look currently, digital would not be as profitable as stores. We do believe, over time, that will change, and we think that will change by multiple things, the overall ecosystem. If you look at pickup, we continue to make significant progress on reducing the cost to serve a customer on pickup. If you look at our sheds, we continue to make progress on our sheds to get them to where the profitability of the shed would be the same as a store.So if you just step back, kind of we view job one is make sure we don't lose the customer. And what we find is that customer, over time, will spend more with us when they're engaged with us through pickup, delivery and in-store. And then obviously, if you look at the incremental profitability, that is making meaningful progress. And we also, when you include media as well, that's making progress. So if you look initially, it is not as profitable but we have every expectations over time that it will be."", 'Gary Millerchip', 'Yes, Rodney, maybe just to add, Dean, a couple of specific data points. Can you hear me, okay?', 'Dean Rosenblum', 'Yes, please.', 'Gary Millerchip', ""Dean -- I think we talked, Dean, before about we sort of bucket our digital business into 2 areas, the sort of the business prior to launching our CFCs, which will be pickup and delivery through our third-party providers and then our customer fulfillment centers powered by Ocado. We've talked before about the pickup and delivery business sort of having a pass-through profitability rate on incremental sales of around 5% or mid-single-digit percent and the store being sort of north of 15%.And we talked a couple of years ago about being on a journey to improving that pass-through rate through some of the things that Rodney mentioned around improving mix, around improving media revenue per transaction and then also lowering the cost to fill a digital order. We've made good progress on all 3 of those areas, and we would certainly see now sort of the digital pass-through profitability heading towards that double-digit rate sort of on that journey towards getting towards parity in terms of overall profitability.And then the Ocado CFCs, we're really still very much in the early stage of that journey where the total investment is sort of starting to peak, and we're starting to see tailwinds in that profitability as we start to achieve more scale in those facilities."", 'Dean Rosenblum', ""That's great. My follow-up question is, you mentioned certifying the second request substantial completion on November 15. That would suggest that the FTC now has 30 days to either make a decision or to extend the period. Do you have any sense right now as to whether we might expect some sort of an FTC decision or that the FTC is more likely to extend the time for that decision?"", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""Dean, it's a great question. And if you look as you -- in our prepared comments, we expect to close in early 2024, as we have all along. We continue to have a cooperative relationship with the FTC and other interested parties, and it's still too early in terms of specific dates."", 'Operator', 'The next question goes to Simeon Gutman of Morgan Stanley.', 'Michael Efram Kessler', 'This is Michael Kessler on for Simeon. Maybe starting with the question on your inflation or deflation outlook for 2024, what your current expectation is. And what would need to happen in the backdrop for us to see either deflation or a return to more modest inflation. And in the event that we see deflation, is there a scenario in which you can hold or still expand margins even in that kind of backdrop?', 'Gary Millerchip', ""Yes, thanks for the question. As you know, we'll certainly provide a lot more specific details of our outlook for 2024 when we get to our quarter 4 earnings in March. And we're continuing, as I'm sure many are in the market, to look at all the data points we see both internally and externally. And we're probably looking at some of the same data sources that you are from the top likes of USDA and other published sources.I think our view right now, we recognize we don't have the perfect crystal ball and we'll continue to watch and evaluate how we see the outlook for next year. But overall, most of the data that we're seeing would tend to point towards more of a typical year next year for food-at-home with food-at-home inflation being in the low single-digit range. We certainly think there are different scenarios that can play out. And of course, we'll look to adapt our model as we would need to, if those were the case, but that would be the data that we're watching. And we'll certainly provide more color when we get to the March earnings and talk specifically about our 2024 views."", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""And one of the things that Gary always reminds me of, if you look over the last 50 years, there's only been 2 years out of the last 50 where it's been negative, where there's been actual deflation in a year. And as you know, we've been able to maintain and create strong business results in all environments, whether it's inflationary or deflationary, and you just manage accordingly."", 'Michael Efram Kessler', ""Okay, great. And then a quick follow-up on the fuel business, which had higher-than-expected profitability. Can you talk about what drove that? And is there any interplay, I guess, between that business and the core supermarket business, if there's any balancing of the profitability dynamics and what you're able to earn to kind of manage the P&L? Or this is being managed separately and it just happened to come in a little stronger in Q3?"", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""Yes. Gary mentioned it, but we're super proud of our fuel team and the partnership with all the divisions. We had a significant increase in the amount of fuel rewards that were issued, so we really look at leveraging both of the businesses to support each other. The other thing that the fuel team has done a nice job on is making sure from an efficiency standpoint on deliveries, on procurement and all the ingredients as well. So really proud of what they've done, but it really is we leverage both sides of the business to support each other and feel really good about where that business turned out."", 'Operator', 'The next question goes to Michael Montani of Evercore ISI.', 'Michael David Montani', ""Wanted to ask on 2 fronts. One was just if you could discuss the overall competitive backdrop? And then secondly, we've heard a fair amount of promotions could uptick into next year. And I guess the question on that would be, what do you see in terms of vendor support versus you all having to fund that yourselves? And then the follow-up was just OG&A dollar growth. Is there still potential for $1 billion cost-out into '24? And what kind of dollar growth should we look for underlying in the fourth quarter?"", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""Yes. I'll answer the competitive backdrop and promotions, and if Gary wants to add anything, he can. And then I'll let Gary ask about or answer the OG&A. If you look at overall, from a competitive standpoint, the market feels very similar than what it has been for a long time. If you look at the promotional activity, CPGs are increasing their funding on promotional.And I think there's 2 things driving that. One is CPG is not being satisfied with their tonnage so they're increasing the amount of support. The other thing for everyone is the supply chain constraints that would have been in place a year ago and 2 years ago is real getting back to normal. So people are beginning to feel comfortable on promoting again, where the worst thing that could have happened is for us or for a CPG to promote something and then not have adequate supply.So it really is behaviors getting back to pre-COVID. And even if you look at shopping during Thanksgiving, it was really more last minute, which really reflected -- if you go back and look at pre-COVID, it's kind of what it was and people getting comfortable there will be products there when they go to buy it. So both great questions, but that's really what we're seeing right now and Gary on the OG&A."", 'Gary Millerchip', ""Yes. Thanks, Rodney. So in OG&A, I'll just maybe take a step back as well and just mention a couple of points that I talked about in the third quarter. As we looked at the third quarter going into it, we would have expected OG&A to be a little bit lower as a rate. The things that were in the plan would have been the investments in average hourly rates and increasing wages for our associates in our stores and supply chain network and also the impact of ESI and they were very much in line with what we expected.The real differences in the third quarter were that we did make some decisions during the quarter to make some strategic investments that we believe will help set up 2024 and beyond in terms of continued revenue growth but also additional cost savings. So as we look at the fourth quarter, we actually believe that the trends in average hourly rate will continue, and of course, Express Scripts will continue to be a factor. But outside of that, we'd expect OG&A to be relatively flat during the fourth quarter.As we look at 2024, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still see both a sort of tailwind from initiatives that we've launched this year that will have a run rate benefit into next year. And we still see good line of sight to continued cost savings by leveraging technology and improving efficiency, driving continued improvement in cost to serve in digital and a number of areas of the business. So we would remain confident that we see a good line of sight to continue to find that sort of 3% to 5% productivity improvements that we target to make sure we can continue to invest in our customers and continue to invest in our associates."", 'Operator', 'The next question goes to John Heinbockel of Guggenheim Partners.', 'John Edward Heinbockel', ""So Rodney, I want to start with, can you talk to -- if you think about the promotional basket, proactive versus reactive on your end, right? And kind of is it -- would you say, I don't know, 80% proactive, 20% reactive, I don't know how you think about that. And then on the reactive side, it would seem that those without a loyalty program would be at a disadvantage to you and that you can see what's going on in the market and possibly respond where yours is more stealth. Is that even remotely how you run the business, right, where you can respond to others based on what you see out there?"", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""Thanks, John, for the question. By far, the majority, and when I say majority would be almost all would be proactive versus reactive. Now all our teams will check prices every single week and there'll be adjustments based on that. But by far, the majority of our discounts are proactive. And some of that is what you can see in an ad. A lot of that is the things that you've mentioned in terms of direct to individual household offers.It's one of the things that we believe the reason why our loyal households continue to grow and some of those aspects is once you become a Kroger shopper, you're getting those loyal customer mailings, which will allow you to stretch your budget more. And there's also personalized offers that even go to look at coupons and download those, and there's significant increase in those.So when you look at -- when you shop with us, obviously, we are a promotional merchant. But when you look at the rewards that we offer between fuel rewards and other rewards and our loyal customer mailings, our basket price overall is within less than cents of our biggest competitor. It's just we go to market and offer a little different way. But it is the reason why loyal shoppers are so important to us because that's the shopper that really gets the full value equation from us."", 'Gary Millerchip', ""Rodney, maybe the one thing I would add to John's question, too, the second part would be, I think, John, it's one of the reasons why we do have additional confidence in how we can navigate through the environment is that I think as a combination of our reward program and more customers engaging digitally post-COVID, it really does create the ability to channel the dollars in a way that give the customer the most impact and most value while also being able to target it rather than having to sort of peanut butter spread it across in different directions. And I think it's a different dynamic now compared to maybe 5, 10 years ago in the way that we're able to personalize that value and go to market."", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""You've been -- you've followed us for a long time and you would have heard us use the word cherry-pickers and really what it is trying to make sure we do is to give value to customers that are loyal to us as opposed to somebody that's just shopping a discounted item that we're not making any money on."", 'John Edward Heinbockel', ""And then maybe as a follow-up, so it sounds like volume is slightly -- is negative, right? I don't know if it's negative 1% or a little more than that but volume is negative. Is that fair, low single-digit? When do you think that returns to positive territory? And is that solely driven, if you looked at the budget-conscious customers, because I know a couple of quarters ago, you broke that out. Is that negativity largely driven by that cohort?"", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""Yes. If you look, volume would be slightly negative. If you look, we -- our trends have improved for 4 quarters in a row from a trend standpoint. That would be largely driven by the value shopper or customers on a budget. And the half full and half empty, the half empty is obviously that's being driven by that customer. Some of that's driven because of the impact from inflation. Part of it's -- or SNAP is down about 30%. The full part is the customers that are loyal, we're continuing to grow with that customer and that customer's profitability is meaningfully better than the value shopper."", 'Operator', 'The next question goes to Krisztina Katai of Deutsche Bank.', 'Krisztina Katai', ""So Rodney, I wanted to ask you just a conceptual question on grocery sector and the level of competition, right? Because if we're thinking about it, why wouldn't the sector be more competitive as we head into 2024? The consumer remains under pressure. Some of the low end is under increased pressure. CPGs are raising their support, volumes continue to lag. So that is question one, just conceptually, why wouldn't that be the case? And secondly, how is Kroger positioned in a potentially no inflation to even deflationary backdrop relative to the base case of a normal food-at-home year of low single-digit inflation?"", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""Yes. If you look at, one of the things that makes this industry a lot of fun is we always assume that the business will continue to be more competitive. And if you look at our fundamental business model over the last 5 years or 10 years or 15 years, every year, we assume that it's going to be more competitive. We worked really hard to identify process changes and cost reductions so that we can continue to fund wage increases and invest in lowering prices for the customer.So when we look at 2024, and obviously, we'll go into a lot more detail like early next year when we give guidance, but right now, we don't see that environment any different than what we would have felt for the last 5 years or 10 years or 15 years. And the positive is customers get a better value every year and they get a better experience every year. And when you look at for us, one of the things that we think is important for the customers, the customer doesn't have to compromise. So they get amazing fresh product that will last a long time when they get at home, with amazing friendly associates, with the smile and support that everything in their basket plus a little bit -- an extra piece of cheese or something they've engaged with Murray. So -- and not have to compromise from a pricing standpoint. So when you look overall, we feel very good in terms of how we're positioned with the customers that really appreciate what we offer."", 'Gary Millerchip', ""Maybe, Rodney, one thing I would just add, too, Krisztina, specific to 2024, a couple of things for Kroger that we think are helpful as we look into next year. One is, of course, that we're cycling the impact of Express Scripts when we get to January and we'll start to see that flow through in the early periods of the year. And then secondly, one of the things that we've seen as we look at 2023, many states, as you know, reduced the amount of SNAP dollars that were available in the market, and those happen sort of around the middle part of our Q1 last year or this year, I should say.What we've seen in 1 or 2 markets where we're cycling those earlier markets where they reduced the SNAP dollars, it certainly starts to create a bit of a different trend in the growth in those markets, too. So we do think there's -- for the industry and specifically for the markets that we operate in, as you start to cycle the impact of those SNAP dollars, which perhaps had a bit more of an impact than we were originally thinking they might across the industry, that starts to create some, I think, tailwind in the industry towards next year's growth as well."", 'Operator', 'The next question goes to Ed Kelly of Wells Fargo.', 'Edward Joseph Kelly', ""Gary, I wanted to ask you about the gross margin. I think you said that the Q4 gross margin, you expect to be flattish. If you could just confirm that. And then looking out, is the base case for '24 that, that flattish trend that would continue? And then within that context, I'm curious about shrink. And maybe just educate us a little bit on when you do your accounts, the visibility you have on where you stand in shrink and do you believe it's peaked?"", 'Gary Millerchip', ""Sure. Thanks, Ed. So the first part of the question, yes, you're essentially right that we -- I said in my prepared comments that we would expect Q4 to look very similar to Q3. The way that I sort of would break that down is that we've been equally as pleased with the progress that we've seen in the margin improvement plan initiatives that we saw in the earlier part of the year as well. So we continue to see strong benefits from Our Brands, strong benefits from sourcing, health and wellness, of course, with Express Scripts is a tailwind this year to gross margin and supply chain and alternative profits. All those areas continue to generate tailwinds in our gross margin rate.What we did in the third quarter is we did invest more in gross margin to balance those benefits, partly in increased pricing and promotion, as Rodney mentioned earlier. And we did also increase advertising costs during the quarter as well. So those would have been the differences quarter-over-quarter in terms of what we saw and what we would expect to continue to be a similar pattern as we think about the fourth quarter.I'd say as we look into beyond 2023, we certainly still see a lot of potential for the tailwinds that I mentioned around Our Brands sourcing, these areas where we believe that we are on a multiyear path to continue to drive improvement and drive growth. And of course, alternative profit streams continues to grow at a double-digit pace off a bigger base as well. So I think we still have a lot of confidence in those levers. And what we're doing is making sure we're balancing the business to set ourselves up for continued sustained growth in the future.From a shrink perspective, we would still see shrink as a headwind, as I mentioned in the prepared comments. I would say it's probably somewhat less dramatic for us than maybe some of our peer group because while we have a general merchandise business that's impacted, it's less impacted than probably some of the big-box retailers, but it would still be a headwind to our gross margin rate that would have impacted the third quarter on a year-over-year basis. That headwind actually would have been less than it was in the second quarter, not dramatically but it would have eased somewhat. So it's still something that we have to work through and continue to offset, but we are seeing at least the trend in terms of year-over-year growth decelerate, but it would still be a headwind today because of the crime and organized retail crime factors I mentioned earlier."", 'William Rodney McMullen', 'The other thing I think is important to remember is a lot of our shrink is in our fresh departments. And our fresh departments, actually, a lot of that is, you can manage it by changing processes and using technology. And our teams have done a great job actually on improving shrink in the fresh departments because of our store teams partnering with warehouse teams on processes and leveraging technology as well. And I think as a big chunk of the trend -- slight trend improvements that Gary mentioned.', 'Operator', 'The next question goes to Chuck Cerankosky of Northcoast Research.', 'Charles Edward Cerankosky', ""Rodney, could you talk a little bit about the economy's effect on inflation on your digital business. And I'm thinking particularly about customers' willingness to spend money on any delivery fees or membership fees, and also how the economy might be impacting delivery volumes and digital order volumes."", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""If you look at over -- thanks, Chuck. If you look at overall inflation is definitely stabilizing overall. And it's -- from a customer standpoint, they appreciate the stabilization but they also know the fact that if you look at over the last 2 years, they've had to endure a lot of inflation. And if you look at some of the fresh departments, some of that has actually returned back to normal. But if you look at on the process side, you wouldn't see that.So if you look at like eggs, for an example, eggs are significantly deflationary. And we'll all be happy when we get to the point where we're cycling that early next year or next year. If you look at customer behavior, it's fascinating, customers do a lot of work to save where they want to save or feel like they need to save. So in pack size, if you look at moving to Our Brands versus some of the national brands. But if you look at membership fees and delivery fees and things like that, that business continues to grow strongly. And in fact, it was up double digits and that's what drove the 11%. I'm sure part of that, and any time I talk to a politician, I always remind them, if you look at customers on a budget, they're under a lot of strain and they're doing a lot of behavior changes. If you look at customers that are not as focused on price because inflation hasn't affected them as much, that customer's behavior is still very strong, and they're still continuing to buy big packs, continuing to buy nicer wines, Murray's Cheese, Starbucks, things like that. So we over-index with our membership program on customers that are more mainstream and upscale, so I'm sure that's part of the reason why we're not seeing the behavior change."", 'Charles Edward Cerankosky', ""Okay. And just real quick, you're exiting the ghost kitchen business. Any particular reason for that?"", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""Yes, great question. Appreciate it. We test a lot of different things, and we'll move on to the next version of it. We still think food away from home is a huge growth opportunity for us and we'll continue to focus on it. The ghost kitchen, the few customers that used it loved it but it just wasn't enough. So it's one of those things where you move on. So thanks, Chuck."", 'Operator', 'The next question goes to Rupesh Parikh of Oppenheimer.', 'Rupesh Dhinoj Parikh', ""Just going back to Kroger's digital performance, another quarter of double-digit growth. Did anything surprise you on the digital front? And just any more color in terms of what you guys are seeing delivery versus pickup?"", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""Yes, I'll start and let Gary finish. I wouldn't call it a surprise, but it's great to see that the NPS scores, both in terms of our year-on-year from a pickup standpoint and a delivery standpoint is very strong. If you look at our shed delivery business, the repeat rate continues to be strong. So it really is the customers really appreciate that white-glove experience. So I don't want to make it sound like we're surprised by it but it's nice to see what we thought play out. Gary, I'll let you..."", 'Gary Millerchip', ""Yes, I think you said it well, Rodney. I think the only thing I would add, Rupesh, is that we've said before, we believe that digital is a growth engine for the company. And I think everything we continue to see gives us that belief it will continue to be an opportunity to drive deeper customer engagement and growth. And I mentioned in a comment earlier, but the thing we didn't talk about in the script was we are seeing continued improvement in profitability. So it's helping profitable growth as well as we're lowering the cost to fill and all that driving more efficiency through technology and continuing to see media revenue growth. So that's the only piece I think that I would reinforce."", 'Operator', 'The next question goes to Kenneth Goldman of JPMorgan.', 'Kenneth B. Goldman', ""I'll take a shot here on next year. I know you're not in a position to really give numbers and I wouldn't ask about that now, but you did talk about hopefully having low single-digit sort of normal inflation next year. You highlighted a healthy amount of productivity you expected or expecting. But you also mentioned that maybe your unit growth right now is a little bit disappointing, and you'll surely be lapping some challenging fuel margins that I imagine you won't assume will recur.So I'm just trying to get a sense if you have maybe sluggish units, fuel comps are tough, to get to your earnings growth algo for next year, do you theoretically have to find other drivers that are better than their algo to offset those headwinds? I just want to kind of get a sense of how to think about at least some initial headwinds and tailwinds into next year, if that all makes sense."", 'Gary Millerchip', ""Yes. Thanks, Ken. As you mentioned, we'll definitely share a lot more color, as you might expect, when we get to March. I think as we think about the model and just taking a bigger picture step back, we certainly believe that we've, over the last few years, built a more diverse ecosystem as a company. So of course, food-at-home is an important part of the sort of -- it drives the flywheel. But as you know, we've been continuing to grow -- our fuel business, continue to grow health and wellness this year even with the impact of Express Groups, and continuing to grow alternative profit streams.So we look at it more as a journey and we do believe that as we're building the strength in that ecosystem, it creates the -- a new way to generate value for our shareholders over time as we've talked about at previous investor meetings. I mean, I think some of the points you've raised would certainly be the areas where we'll be focusing on. I don't think it's a different strategy for Kroger. It's how do we continue to drive that flywheel as we think about taking cost out of our business so that we can invest more in customers and associates, continuing to drive traffic so we can continue to grow the alternative profit businesses. And we do think there's opportunity for margin improvement to continue beyond 2023 because of the initiatives we're driving around sourcing, supply chain, alternative profit streams, et cetera.So I think from our perspective, certainly, if you were in a period where you weren't seeing sales growth for a sustained period of time because our model is built on sales growth, we have to look at our cost base and would look at our cost base in certain areas to be more productive. But we still believe that food-at-home is -- will normalize in the typical pattern that we see of that sort of 1% to 2% inflation over time and sort of 2% to 3% food-at-home growth. And we think our model is really well set up to be able to drive growth within that framework."", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""Thanks, Ken. The only other thing I would add to Gary's comment is if you look at our Seamless business, we would expect that to continue to make progress as well, as I mentioned earlier."", 'Operator', 'The next question goes to Michael Lasser of UBS.', 'Michael Lasser', ""As you talk to your processed food and CPG partners, what are they telling you about their desire to further raise prices into next year, given your expectation that there could be typical inflation across the assortment that would necessitate that center of the sort of prices go up? And this is against the backdrop where volumes continue to go down, you're providing more support. Why are they not rolling back prices to try and drive volume? And as part of that, given that you used your P&L to fund promotions a bit more in the third quarter, is that a sign that you are running into the limitation of the vendors willing to provide support for you -- to these promotions?"", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""Thanks, Michael. If you look at overall, they say in economics, all short statements are wrong. And you have CPGs that are all over the board in terms of their approach. Some CPGs are very willing to give up tonnage. And if they are, Our Brands will stay -- will be there for a customer to give them incredible value. And what we find is when a customer tries Our Brands, our repeat rate is incredibly high because of the quality and the value for the money.If you look in the quarter, in terms of funding, it was really done by CPGs and us. And as I mentioned earlier, CPGs were more aggressive in funding some of the promotions in the third quarter than the second quarter and would expect that to continue. We are seeing more CPGs worrying about their tonnage growth, and I think that's part of what's driving that willingness, too. So I appreciate the question, and thanks, Michael."", 'Operator', 'Our last question goes to Kelly Bania of BMO.', 'Kelly Ann Bania', ""I wanted to go back to the comment about building a more diverse ecosystem and talk a little bit more about alternative profit growth. I think there was a comment that, that is still growing double digits, which I think would mean around $150 million to $200 million in incremental year-over-year profit. But maybe just wanted to give you the opportunity to comment on that if that's the right ballpark. And how many more years can this business continue to grow at double-digit rate into the coming years?"", 'William Rodney McMullen', ""Yes. I don't know that Gary and I will want to give the specifics for '24 on the all profit since we're still going through the process. But we would expect all profit to be a meaningful contributor of growth next year. And that's really driven by 2 things. One is our continued growth in our digital business, which is supporting our media business growth. And we think we're just getting started on that.If you look in the media world, your competitors are Google and Amazon and Meta and Walmart and then a lot of other players. And one of the things that we think transparency is so important in being able to give people good data is we think that is incredibly helpful relative to the Googles and Metas and others. So we see a long-term opportunity to continue to grow the business there. And the specifics, I don't know that we want to get there either.And if you look at some of the other alternative profit businesses, some of those, we have wide variance of performance within the company. So part of that growth is just driven by taking best-in-class within our own company and growing that as well. So Kelly, I appreciate the question.And thanks, everyone, for all the questions. And as always, I'd like to take a few moments to share some comments with our associates listening in. To start, I'd like to say a huge thank you for all the hard work that you've done to make the holidays be so memorable for our customers and what you will do for the -- following the rest of the holiday season to make it equally as memorable for customers.As you know, food plays an important part in any celebration, and it provides an opportunity for people to connect and people that we love, especially with them and sharing special moments. If you had a chance to see our holiday film, you saw that idea come to life. And if you haven't seen our holiday film, you can go to YouTube to look at the full film. And it really does recognize that food connects us all. And whether that's honoring family traditions or creating new family ones, I've just been so inspired to see how our associates and our customers on sharing their videos and the unique ways they celebrate the holidays.As I said before, thank you for everything you do to create special memories for our customers every single day. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. We wish everyone a happy holiday season. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year."", 'Operator', ""Thank you. This now concludes today's call.

This can potentially stimulate the prospects of the merger deal.', 'Both Cigna and Humana have experienced failed merger attempts in the past. In 2017, a federal judge ruled against a Humana and Aetna merger deal on anti-competitive grounds.

So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. So it would be better to isolate the growth rate over the last year for our analysis.

It's noted that Wells Fargo's revenue from operations was lower than its revenue in the last twelve months, so that could distort our analysis of its margins.

According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""In other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading.

Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'Although both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.', 'Broker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', ""It has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them."", 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'Furthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Is WFC a Good Investment?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Wells Fargo, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $5.24.', ""Analysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Wells Fargo.

Though such banks constitute only 3% of the total number of FDIC-insured institutes, these account for approximately 80% of the industry’s earnings. Some of the notable names in this space are JPMorgan JPM, Bank of America BAC, Citigroup C and Wells Fargo WFC.At present, JPMorgan sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), while Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Banks’ earnings were adversely impacted by higher provisions on expectations of a worsening operating backdrop. Also, non-interest income declined during the quarter. A rise in non-interest expenses, higher funding costs and lower deposit balance were the other headwinds.Nonetheless, a rise in net operating revenues driven by growth in net interest income (NII) acted as a major tailwind. Higher interest rates and decent loan demand offered some support.Community banks, constituting 91% of all FDIC-insured institutions, reported a net income of $6.7 billion, down 15% year over year. This was mainly due to an increase in non-interest expenses and lower non-interest income.The return on average assets in third-quarter 2023 fell to 1.17% from 1.21% as of Sep 30, 2022.', 'Net operating revenues came in at $249.3 billion, up 1.6% year over year.NII was $175.2 billion, increasing 3.9% year over year. Net interest margin (NIM) jumped 30 basis points (bps) to 3.30%, which is above the pre-pandemic average of 3.25%. JPMorgan, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo also witnessed an increase in NIM.Non-interest income declined 3.5% to $74.1 billion.Total non-interest expenses were $140.9 billion, increasing 1.5%. The rise was mainly due to higher compensation expenses.', 'Net charge-offs (NCOs) for loans and leases were $15.7 billion, surging substantially year over year. NCO rate was 0.51% in the third quarter, up 25 bps from the prior-year quarter on the back of a higher credit card charge-off balance. The NCO rate is now above its pre-pandemic average of 0.48%.Provisions for credit losses were $19.5 billion during the third quarter, jumping 33.2% from the year-ago quarter. Several lenders, including Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo, reported higher provisions.', 'As of Sep 30, 2023, total loans and leases were $12.3 trillion, which grew marginally from the prior quarter. The rise was majorly driven by higher credit card loan balances and one-to-four family residential mortgages.Total deposits amounted to $18.6 trillion, down marginally sequentially, mainly due to a fall in non-interest-bearing deposits. This marked the sixth consecutive quarterly decline. \xa0Unrealized losses on securities were $683.9 billion, jumping 22.5% from the prior quarter. The surge was largely due to an increase in mortgage rates that lowered the value of mortgage-backed securities.As of Sep 30, 2023, the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) balance increased 2% from the June 2023 level to $119.3 billion. A rise in the DIF was largely driven by an assessment income of $3.2 billion.', 'During the reported quarter, one bank failed. Further, two new banks were added, while 28 banks were absorbed following mergers.As of Sep 30, 2023, the number of ‘problem’ banks was 44. Total assets of the ‘problem’ institutions increased to $53.5 billion from $46 billion reported in the second quarter of 2023.', 'The FDIC chairman, Martin Gruenberg, said, “The banking industry still faces significant downside risks from the continued effects of inflation, rising market interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty. In addition, deterioration in the industry’s commercial real estate portfolio is beginning to materialize in office properties. These issues, together with funding and earnings pressures, will remain matters of ongoing supervisory attention by the FDIC.”Though higher interest rates, decent loan demand and a changing revenue mix will offer much-needed support to banks’ top line, rising deposit costs will weigh substantially on it. This will likely lead to a contraction in net interest margins going forward. Also, a deteriorating macroeconomic environment is expected to hurt banks’ financials.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Pfizer's  ROE today."", 'Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Pfizer ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Pfizer is:', '11% = US$11b ÷ US$97b (Based on the trailing twelve months to October 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.11 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""To start with, Pfizer's ROE looks acceptable. And on comparing with the industry, we found that the the average industry ROE is similar at 11%. This probably goes some way in explaining Pfizer's significant 20% net income growth over the past five years amongst other factors. We believe that there might also be other aspects that are positively influencing the company's earnings growth. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio."", ""We then compared Pfizer's net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 8.5% in the same 5-year period."", ""Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Pfizer's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry."", 'Pfizer has a three-year median payout ratio of 41% (where it is retaining 59% of its income) which is not too low or not too high. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the high growth we discussed above, it looks like Pfizer is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.', ""Additionally, Pfizer has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 52% over the next three years. Still, forecasts suggest that Pfizer's future ROE will rise to 16% even though the the company's payout ratio is expected to rise. We presume that there could some other characteristics of the business that could be driving the anticipated growth in the company's ROE."", ""Overall, we are quite pleased with Pfizer's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. The latest industry analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to maintain its current growth rate. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

We have also discussed the latest trends in the employment and hiring landscape around the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Highest Paying Jobs Without a Degree in 2023.\xa0', ""In the aftermath of the Great Recession, the stringent requirement of a college degree for employment locked out nearly two-thirds of American workers from several opportunities, exacerbating socioeconomic disparities. This disproportionately affected Black and Latino workers, perpetuating inequality in the workforce. As of 2022, the unemployment rate for high school graduates stands at 4.5%, revealing a stark contrast with the 2.2% rate for those with a bachelor's degree."", 'However, recognizing the need for a more inclusive approach, companies are undergoing a transformative shift. Between 2017 and 2019, 46% of middle-skill and 31% of high-skill jobs witnessed a reduction in degree requirements, with key sectors such as finance, business management, engineering, and healthcare leading the change. Major players like International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM), Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN), Okta Inc (NASDAQ:OKTA), Dell Technologies Inc (NYSE:DELL), Bank of America Corp (NYSE:BAC), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Delta Airlines Inc (NYSE:DAL) are spearheading this shift, dropping degree prerequisites to give importance to skills as the hiring criteria. This shift not only addresses labor shortages but also opens up an estimated 1.4 million jobs.\xa0', ""According to Harvard Business Review, International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) transformed its hiring practices through the SkillsFirst initiative, recognizing that traditional degree requirements limited access to a diverse talent pool. In 2012, less than 10% of US based roles at International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) were open to non-degree holders. The company revamped job descriptions, prioritizing specific skills over general credentials. For instance, a cybersecurity posting shifted from requiring degrees to highlighting skills like hypothesis development and programming proficiency. Hence, in 2023, it is not wrong to say that 6 figure jobs without college degree are no longer a far-fetched dream but highly realistic. It is also worth noting that Payscale's college salary report found the major that pays the most in 2023 is petroleum engineering."", 'International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) also collaborated with educational institutions, offering internships to students from the P-TECH program, which grew from a single Brooklyn high school in 2011 to over 300 schools globally in 2022.

Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value.

So if Tesla had actually released the truck and started delivering it to customers soon after that event, they really could\'ve captured this market but now we\'ve seen there\'s the F150 Lightning (F), Rivian R1T (RIVN), there\'s a Hummer truck (GM), and there\'s more coming out... So I think there is an argument to be made that Tesla kind of missed the moment here.""', 'Click here to watch the full interview on the Yahoo Finance YouTube page or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.', ""AKIKO FUJITA: While some investors are seeing this Cybertruck event as a potential halo truck for the company, there are still doubts about how large of an impact it can have, and if it can boost Tesla's top line. Let's bring in RBC Capital Markets lead equity analyst global autos, Tom Narayan, and the verge transportation editor, Andrew Hawkins, to get their insights."", ""Good to have both of you here. Tom, let's kick things off with you. Who is the audience? Who's going to buy the Cybertruck?"", 'TOM NARAYAN: Yeah. This is a pretty specific niche customer base for sure. But this was never going to be a big volume product. So there were a lot of folks in 2019 that wanted this product. I suspect the conversion rate will probably be more like 20% or so. But still, if they can get something like 200,000 to 250,000 of these at maturity per year off of a base-- the US are is what, 15, 16 million.', ""So I think that's actually very doable, even If it's a niche customer base, a segment, a cool factor, so to speak. But even more than that, I think this is going to be a halo car really for differentiating the brand. Folks are even talking about how they went into showrooms yesterday. And they saw ads for a Model 3 for only $29,000. So it's really being used to sell 3's and Y's. That's really how we should look at the Cybertruck, not as its own thing. It's really a halo car designed to incite demand for 3's and Y's. That's where most of the volumes are going to come from next year."", ""RACHELLE AKUFFO: So then, Andrew, I want to bring you in here. Because if the idea is perhaps to get some of these future Tesla customers in at a lower price point by looking at the 3 and having the Cybertruck as more of an aspirational look at the brand situation here. But we still don't know the price yet."", ""So as we look at the demographics of the people who've put these $100 deposits down, do we know much about how they're going to this-- whether or not they can afford the Cybertruck, we still don't actually know how much it costs."", ""ANDREW HAWKINS: Yeah. That's a great question. I haven't seen any demographic data on the people who are reservation holders at this time. But I think you can probably draw a lot of conclusions just based on assumptions that it's probably going to be a lot of early adopters, people who are turned on as opposed to turned off by the polarizing design of the Cybertruck. And I really agree with what everyone's been saying so far about how this is more of a halo car."", ""I think Tesla's own employees have been describing it as like a Lamborghini Countach more so than an F-150 or a Silverado. And I think that highlights a lot of interesting elements about the Cybertruck, which is that, perhaps, it's missed its moment. When it was first announced in 2019, there were no electric trucks on the market at that time. And so if Tesla had actually released the truck and started delivering it to customers soon after that event, they really could have captured this market."", ""But now, we've seen there's the F-150 Lightning. There's the Rivian R1T's. There's a Hummer truck. And there's more coming out. And by the time they actually get production running up at scale, we're going to see even more trucks on the market. So I think there's an argument to be made that Tesla missed the moment here. And it's a weird thing to have done because trucks are just a huge business in the United States."", ""They're huge volume, huge margin. This could have been a really an opportunity for Tesla to dominate the EV truck market in the same way that it's dominated the EV passenger car market. And instead, we got this very polarizing niche car that's really going to only appeal, I think, to a small segment of really motivated Elon Musk fans, and not really much else beyond that.""]"

For instance, a cybersecurity posting shifted from requiring degrees to highlighting skills like hypothesis development and programming proficiency. Hence, in 2023, it is not wrong to say that 6 figure jobs without college degree are no longer a far-fetched dream but highly realistic.

This is a bigger decline in earnings estimates compared to what we saw in the comparable periods for the first three quarters of 2023.', 'The negative revisions trend for Q4 is fairly broad-based, with earnings estimates for 12 of the 16 Zacks sectors coming down since the quarter got underway.', 'Q4 earnings estimates have come down the most for the Autos, Medical, Transportation, Basic Materials, and Consumer Discretionary sectors. Of the two largest earnings contributors to the index, Tech estimates are essentially flat since the quarter got underway, while Finance sector estimates are only modestly down.', 'With results from nearly 97% of S&P 500 members already out, we can confidently say that the overall earnings picture remains stable and largely positive.

The biggest cuts to estimates have been for the Autos, Medical, Consumer Discretionary, Transportation, and Basic Materials sectors.', 'We noted Disney DIS from the Consumer Discretionary sector and United Airlines UAL from the Transportation sector as examples of the aforementioned negative revisions trend.', 'The current Q4 Zacks Consensus EPS for Disney of $1.04 is down from $1.16 a month ago and $12.39 two months back. Disney shares were up following last week’s better-than-expected results, but the company’s near-term earnings outlook is under pressure.', 'The negative revisions trend is even more pronounced for United Airlines, which is currently expected to bring in $1.73 per share, down from $2.46 per share in the year-earlier period. United’s $1.73 estimate is down from $2.31 a month ago and $2.94 three months back.', 'The long-feared recession doesn’t appear in this near-term earnings outlook.', 'This big-picture view of corporate profitability doesn’t leave much room for that development either, as shown in the chart above.

This upgrade primarily reflects an upward trend in earnings estimates, which is one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices.', ""The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate."", 'The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.', 'Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Ross Stores basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.', 'Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock Prices', ""The change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, has proven to be strongly correlated with the near-term price movement of its stock. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their transaction of large amounts of shares then leads to price movement for the stock."", ""For Ross Stores, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher."", 'Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions', 'Empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.', ""The Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 2.6%.', 'Bottom Line', ""Unlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating.

According to P&S Market Research the global luggage market was $38.6 billion in 2021 and is expected to grow at a 7.5% annual rate through 2030. According to Mordor Intelligence the global luggage market was valued at $165.4 billion in 2022 and is expected to grow at an annualized rate of 7.1% over the next 5 years. Mordor believes that consumers are currently leaning towards luxury brands and some of the major players in this industry are LVMH Moët Hennessy - Louis Vuitton, Société Européenne (OTC:LVMUY), Kering, Chanel Limited, Hermes International SA, and Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR). Out of these companies Tapestry, Inc. (NYSE:TPR) looks like an interesting stock to invest in. Tapestry shares were trading at $40 five years ago which means, the stock’s total return over the last 5 years is close to zero after adjusting for dividend payments.

Whether you opt for lightweight suitcases or complete luggage sets, there is a wide array of choices available when it comes to investing in top-notch luggage. The evolution of suitcases has been notable since their introduction to the market in the 19th century, coinciding with the rise of mass tourism.', 'The prospect of purchasing luggage can be both intimidating and enjoyable. Along the way, you might encounter the best and worst luggage brands. Given the different variations of sizes, types, and brands available, selecting the right suitcases can be challenging. Opting for luggage or suitcase sets provides a practical solution to this dilemma, offering a range of options tailored to diverse travel styles and plans. Additionally, these sets often feature a nesting design, serving as a valuable space-saving bonus.', ""When choosing a luggage, most people are torn between a 4-wheel or a 2-wheel option. Each type comes with its own set of advantages and drawbacks. Four-wheeled cases offer ease of movement in any direction. Another perk is the ability to stack additional bags on top. They also exhibit better balance, reducing the likelihood of toppling over. However, it's worth noting that the extra wheels can occupy more space within the case. If traversing rocky terrain or cobblestones, 4-wheel versions may not be as maneuverable as their 2-wheel counterparts. Once you've exited the airport, and you're more likely to be pulling your case, the 2-wheel rollers are better suited for this task."", ""Another factor to take into account is the outer shell, specifically whether you prefer a soft or hard one. Soft cases provide more flexibility, allowing for a less rigid packing approach. The materials used for soft cases are typically synthetic and durable, making them easy to clean. While soft side cases are lighter than their hard case counterparts, they may be more susceptible to rips and tears. On the other hand, hard cases offer enhanced protection for delicate items and provide a safeguard against inclement weather. If you've ever experienced the inconvenience of having your luggage exposed to wet and windy conditions on the tarmac, you'll appreciate the significant advantage of hard cases in such scenarios. Dealing with damp belongings at the beginning of a vacation is a situation most would prefer to avoid."", 'In addition to checking the luggage\'s storage capacity, it\'s crucial to consider the inclusion of extra features such as built-in luggage tags, Transportation Security Administration (TSA) approved locks, and internal compartments with zippers. However, the assessment shouldn\'t stop there. Factors like price and quality should be part of the top considerations. When choosing a piece of luggage, the saying ""you get what you pay for"" often holds true, with price correlating directly to the product\'s quality and durability. Prioritize durability and scratch resistance, not only in external materials but also in handles and wheel mechanisms. Pay attention to the resilience of zippers and fastenings, as these components typically endure the most wear and tear. Meanwhile, if your travel plans involve less frequent trips and fewer airport visits, you might find that you can compromise on the durability of your luggage. However, for those with more regular and diverse travel itineraries, investing in sturdy, well-crafted luggage becomes an important and wise choice.', 'alphaspirit/Shutterstock.com', 'Our Methodology', 'To compile our list of the top 20 best luggage brands heading into 2024, we conducted comprehensive research, gathering data from a variety of credible sources.

In this discussion, I look at another dividend champion, Genuine Parts Co. (NYSE:GPC), a global distributor of industrial and automotive replacement parts with over 10,600 locations worldwide. The company has consistently paid dividends to shareholders since its initial public offering in 1948, increasing them annually for the past 67 years.', ""High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' Portfolio"", 'This Powerful Chart Made Peter Lynch 29% A Year For 13 Years', 'How to calculate the intrinsic value of a stock?', 'Genuine Parts has two key business divisions: Automotive and Industrial.', 'The Automotive segment is responsible for distributing replacement parts for a diverse range of trucks, automobiles and other vehicles. The Industrial segment specializes in distributing a variety of industrial products, which include bearings, fluid power transmission equipment and material handling tools.', ""In 2022, the Automotive segment generated $13.67 billion in sales, accounting for 62% of the total revenue. The Industrial segment's revenue came in at over $8.43 billion, representing more than 38% of total sales. Profit-wise, the Automotive segment generated $1.91 billion, whereas the Industrial segment produced an excess of $886.6 million."", ""Genuine Parts has utilized a reasonable amount of leverage in its operations. As of September, its shareholders' equity stood at approximately $4.2 billion, which included $654.6 million in cash on hand. The company's total interest-bearing debt was reported at $3.3 billion, alongside $919.5 million attributed to operating lease liabilities and $198.2 million in pension and other post-retirement benefits liabilities."", ""Over the past decade, Genuine Parts has increased the leverage level to grow its business. Notably, its debt-to-equity ratio saw an increase from 0.18 in 2012 to 1.10 in 2023, indicating a significant rise but maintaining a level of prudence. The company's operating earnings have consistently covered its interest expenses. However, there has been a downward trend in interest expense coverage because the increase in debt outpaced the growth in operating earnings. Since 2012, the interest coverage ratio has decreased from 49.6 times to 21.8 times, which, while lower, still represents a comfortable position for the company."", ""Genuine Parts boasts a robust business model with a high return on capital, demonstrating impressive financial performance. Over the past decade, the company's return on capital has seen some variability, ranging between 12.35% and 29.04%. After experiencing a dip to 12.35% in 2019, the return on capital has made a noteworthy recovery, climbing to approximately 19.5% by 2022. The years 2019 and 2020 were challenging for Genuine Parts' earnings, with the company facing $100 million in merger and restructuring charges in 2019. The subsequent year, it encountered an additional $50 million in similar charges, along with a substantial goodwill impairment charge exceeding $500 million. However, as goodwill impairment is a non-cash charge, the company still produced consistently positive free cash flow. Its annual free cash flow in the past decade has stayed in the range of $614 million to $1.87 billion. This record illustrates Genuine Parts' ability to not only generate, but also increase free cash flow over time. This enduring positive free cash flow underscores Genuine Parts' robust financial foundation and operational efficiency, even in the face of economic challenges."", 'The company is renowned for its longstanding tradition of consistent dividend payments since its initial public offering in 1948, with a record of increasing its dividend each year for the past 67 years.', ""From 2012 to 2022, the dividend per share rose from $1.98 to $3.58, reflecting a compounded annual growth rate of 6.10%. Notably, the company has taken a prudent approach to dividend payments, ensuring they are well within its financial means rather than striving to maintain its streak at any cost. Throughout this period, the free cash flow generated annually has more than adequately covered the dividends distributed to shareholders, with the payout ratio remaining between 24.3% and 71.5%. This careful management of dividends relative to free cash flow provides investors with a sense of security and trust in the company's fiscal responsibility."", 'The Gordon Growth Model, which is particularly suited for valuing companies with a stable dividend growth history, can be aptly applied to Genuine Parts, given its impressive track record of dividend increases for almost seven decades. If we project the company will maintain its historical dividend growth rate of approximately 6%as seen in the previous 10 yearsand apply a discount rate of 8%, the intrinsic value of Genuine Parts is calculated as follows:', 'P = Expected Dividend for 2023 / (Required Rate of Return - Dividend Growth Rate)', '= 3.58 *(1+6%) / (8%-6%)', '= $190', 'According to the Gordon Growth Model, the intrinsic value of Genuine Parts is estimated to be $190 per share, which is substantially higher than its current trading price of $138 per share. This suggests Genuine Parts is currently undervalued in the stock market by roughly 38%.', 'Genuine Parts stands out in the Dividend Aristocrat category with an impressive record of raising dividends since its IPO. Financially, the company has demonstrated prudent leverage management and robust free cash flow generation, showcasing strong operational efficiency and a high return on capital. Despite these strengths, the company appears undervalued in the market, with the Gordon Growth Model indicating its intrinsic value is higher than its current stock price. This suggests Genuine Parts not only boasts a solid history of financial performance, but also presents a potentially attractive investment opportunity for those looking at long-term growth and stability.', 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.25 in profit."", 'So far, we\'ve learned that ROE is a measure of a company\'s profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company\'s future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""To begin with, Cummins has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 15% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Despite this, Cummins' five year net income growth was quite low averaging at only 3.2%. This is interesting as the high returns should mean that the company has the ability to generate high growth but for some reason, it hasn't been able to do so. Such a scenario is likely to take place when a company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures."", ""Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Cummins' reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 8.8% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see."", ""Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock.

This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know."", 'Despite having a normal three-year median payout ratio of 39% (or a retention ratio of 61% over the past three years, Cummins has seen very little growth in earnings as we saw above. Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.', ""Additionally, Cummins has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 35%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Cummins' future ROE will be 23% which is again, similar to the current ROE."", ""In total, it does look like Cummins has some positive aspects to its business. Yet, the low earnings growth is a bit concerning, especially given that the company has a high rate of return and is reinvesting ma huge portion of its profits.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed.

Although, when we looked at Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS), it didn't seem to tick all of these boxes."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business.

Over the last five years, returns on capital have decreased to 5.3% from 18% five years ago. However it looks like Walt Disney might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It may take some time before the company starts to see any change in earnings from these investments."", ""In summary, Walt Disney is reinvesting funds back into the business for growth but unfortunately it looks like sales haven't increased much just yet.

Its solutions are used in leading-edge computing, consumer, networking and mobile products.A major portion of the revenues is derived from DRAM sales. The company's mission is to be the most efficient and innovative global provider of semiconductor memory solutions.Micron reported revenues of $15.54 billion in fiscal 2023. The company has four reportable segments:Compute and Networking Business Unit (CNBU): The unit comprises of DRAM and NOR Flash products that are sold to the computer, networking, graphics, and cloud server markets, and NAND Flash products which are sold into the networking market. CNBU delivered revenues of $5.71 billion (37% of total revenues) in fiscal 2023.Mobile Business Unit (MBU): The unit comprises Micron’s discrete DRAM, discrete NAND and managed NAND (including eMMC and universal flash storage (UFS) solutions) products that are sold to smartphone and other mobile-device markets. MBU generated revenues of $3.63 billion (23%) in fiscal 2023.Storage Business Unit (SBU): The unit accounts for solid state drives (SSDs) and component-level solutions sold into enterprise and cloud, client and consumer storage markets as well as other discrete storage products sold in component and wafer forms to the removable storage markets. SBU’s revenues grossed $2.55 billion (16%) in fiscal 2023.Embedded Business Unit (EBU): The unit includes Micron’s discrete DRAM, discrete NAND, managed NAND and NOR products, which are sold to the automotive, industrial and consumer markets. EBU’s revenues logged $3.64 billion (24%) in fiscal 2023.The company struggles with intense competition from Intel, Samsung Electronics, SK Hynix, Toshiba Memory and Western Digital Corporation."", 'Bottom Line', ""Anyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of a few things: research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in Micron a decade ago, you're probably feeling pretty good about your investment today."", 'A $1000 investment made in November 2013 would be worth $3,634.60, or a gain of 263.46%, as of November 30, 2023, according to our calculations.

A rising mix of high-value solutions, enhancement in customer engagement and improvement in cost structure are growth drivers as well. Additionally, 5G adoption in Internet of Things devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for memory and storage. Our model estimates Micron’s fiscal 2024 revenues to grow approximately 29% year over year. Nonetheless, the company's near-term prospects look gloomy as weakening consumer spending is negatively impacting the demand for memory chips used in personal computers (PCs) and smartphones.

These workers were earning the minimum wage at that time, but due to burgeoning cost of living, this amount was well below the living wage declared by economists then – the wage that is sufficient to meet all necessary expenses."", 'The federal minimum wage in the US is just $7.25 per hour and has remained unchanged since it was set in 2009. The protests in New York sparked a national political movement that has come to be known as the Fight for $15, and it is not just limited to the restaurant industry. The movement has involved strikes by workers at airports, gas stations, convenience stores, and even affected the childcare and healthcare sector.', 'The movement has had its successes, with many state governments announcing to gradually raise the minimum wage year-by-year to $15. At the local level, cities such as New York City, Seattle, and San Francisco, where the cost of living is significantly higher, have already increased their minimum wage to $15. That being said, workers continue to regularly mobilize across the US, especially in states that have no minimum wage and where wages are set to equal the federal wage level.', ""The demand for higher minimum wages has received both support and criticism. Ed Rensi, the former CEO of McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), in 2016 cited the movement for higher wages as the reason for the fast-food giant installing automatic kiosks at restaurants nationwide. Rensi argued that increased wages are directly linked with unemployment. The McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD)’s ex-CEO also fears that small businesses that cannot afford automation and can also not pay high labor costs will be at the risk of being driven out of business altogether, or be forced to move their operations to states that have lower wages."", 'In contrast, Amazon.com, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMZN) in the years to come. Retail giant Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT), in 2020, announced to raise the minimum wage of its employees to $15 and to give a one-time bonus of $200 to all hourly employees. In March 2022, Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) made headlines by declaring that it was raising the minimum wage to as much as $24, depending on the nature of the job and the local market.', 'The company also shared its plan to make healthcare more accessible for its employees. Workers who worked more than 25 hours a week would be eligible for Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT)’s medical plan. The health benefits and pay increases will cost the company $300 million and are part of the strategy to retain employees.', 'In January this year, despite the economic slowdown, America’s largest employer, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) gave a 17% raise in minimum wage to workers who cater to customers and stock shelves. Store employees now earn anywhere between $14-19, depending on the state they are based in.

(NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) have taken it upon themselves to limit the level of inflation burden they pass on to the already-burdened final consumer.

340,f350ddef-9702-3d7b-bb1e-0a2ec3e6ecff,STX,2023-12-01,"Insider Sell: EVP & CFO Gianluca Romano Offloads 61,895 Shares of Seagate Technology ...",GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/insider-sell-evp-cfo-gianluca-100521306.html,1701425121,STORY,['STX'],"[""Seagate Technology Holdings PLC (NASDAQ:STX), a global leader in data storage solutions, has recently witnessed a significant insider sell by one of its top executives. Gianluca Romano, the company's Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, sold a substantial number of shares, raising questions about the insider's confidence in the company's future performance."", 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 10 Warning Signs with STX.', ""Gianluca Romano has been serving as the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Seagate Technology Holdings PLC. With a deep understanding of the financial aspects of the technology sector, Romano plays a crucial role in steering the company's financial strategies and ensuring its fiscal health. His actions, especially in the realm of stock transactions, are closely monitored by investors as they can provide insights into the company's internal perspective on its valuation and future prospects."", ""Seagate Technology Holdings PLC is a preeminent player in the data storage industry, providing products that span from hard disk drives (HDDs) to solid-state drives (SSDs) and enterprise storage solutions. The company's products are essential for data creation, storage, and management, catering to a wide array of customers including enterprises, cloud service providers, and end consumers. Seagate's commitment to innovation ensures that it remains at the forefront of the data storage market, even as the demand for data capacity continues to surge globally."", ""On November 29, 2023, Gianluca Romano sold 61,895 shares of Seagate Technology Holdings PLC at a price of $79.02 per share. This transaction reduced Romano's holdings in the company and was part of a series of sales conducted by the insider over the past year. In total, Romano has sold 78,877 shares and has not made any purchases during the same period. This pattern of selling without corresponding buys could be interpreted as a lack of confidence by the insider in the company's short-term growth potential or valuation."", ""Insider transactions are often considered a signal by investors, as insiders may sell shares for various reasons including personal financial planning or diversification. However, consistent selling by insiders, particularly without any buys, can be perceived as a bearish indicator. It is important to consider these transactions in the context of the company's overall performance and market conditions."", 'The relationship between insider transactions and stock price is complex. While insider sells do not always lead to a decline in stock prices, they can influence investor sentiment, especially when they are part of a broader trend. In the case of Seagate Technology Holdings PLC, the stock has been trading at a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 1.45, indicating that it is significantly overvalued based on its GF Value.', ""The GF Value, an intrinsic value estimate developed by GuruFocus, suggests that Seagate's stock is trading well above its estimated fair value of $54.38. This overvaluation could be a contributing factor to the insider's decision to sell shares, as it may represent a strategic move to capitalize on the current high stock price."", ""Historically, the stock has traded at various multiples, and the GF Value takes into account historical price-earnings ratio, price-sales ratio, price-book ratio, and price-to-free cash flow. Additionally, the GuruFocus adjustment factor is applied based on the company's past returns and growth, along with future business performance estimates from Morningstar analysts."", ""The insider transaction history for Seagate Technology Holdings PLC shows a lack of insider buying over the past year, with zero insider buys recorded. On the other hand, there have been nine insider sells in the same timeframe. This trend could be indicative of insiders' collective assessment that the stock's current price does not present a compelling buying opportunity, or it may reflect a broader strategy of profit-taking during a period of perceived overvaluation."", ""With a market cap of $16.546 billion, Seagate Technology Holdings PLC is a significant player in the technology sector. The stock's trading price of $79.02 on the day of Gianluca Romanos recent sell, combined with the GF Value of $54.38, paints a picture of a stock that may be overextended in terms of valuation. Investors should consider whether the current price reflects the company's long-term growth potential or if it is inflated due to short-term market dynamics."", ""In conclusion, the recent insider sell by EVP & CFO Gianluca Romano is a noteworthy event for investors of Seagate Technology Holdings PLC. While insider sells are not uncommon, the absence of insider buys and the stock's significant overvaluation based on the GF Value warrant careful consideration. Investors should continue to monitor insider activity and company performance to make informed decisions regarding their investment in Seagate Technology Holdings PLC."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. With that in mind, the ROCE of United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us."", ""For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for United Parcel Service:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.18 = US$10.0b ÷ (US$70b - US$16b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""So, United Parcel Service has an ROCE of 18%.

If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for United Parcel Service."", ""The trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has consistently earned 18% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 58% in that time. Since 18% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders."", ""The main thing to remember is that United Parcel Service has proven its ability to continually reinvest at respectable rates of return. Therefore it's no surprise that shareholders have earned a respectable 65% return if they held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further."", ""One more thing to note, we've identified   2 warning signs  with United Parcel Service and understanding these should be part of your investment process."", 'For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.', 'Have feedback on this article?

The surcharge applies to the base rates and to any add-on charges known as accessorials.', 'The last time UPS changed its fuel surcharge table was in April 2022 during a cycle when weekly diesel prices set by the Department of Energy’s Energy Information Administration (EIA) frequently exceeded $5 a gallon. Fuel prices spiked along with the price of oil amid fears that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine would disrupt commodity supplies.', 'UPS’ most recent move, however, comes amid an ongoing downward move in diesel pump prices. The weekly on-highway diesel price set on Monday by the EIA stood at $4.14 a gallon. That is 15 cents a gallon below the price set two weeks prior and nearly $1 a gallon below the average pump price at this time a year ago. UPS and rival FedEx Corp. adjust their prices with a one-week lag from the most recent EIA price.', 'By contrast, surcharge levels will decline for U.S. domestic air, international import and export services. They will rise for the carrier’s international import and export ground services. Air shipment surcharges are set to the EIA’s jet fuel index.', 'UPS was unavailable for comment at press time.', '', 'UPS and FedEx (NYSE: FDX) index their diesel levies to a band of prices established by the EIA. UPS has in the past adjusted its ground-delivery surcharges 25 basis points for every 12 cents-a-gallon move in the EIA diesel price. FedEx Ground, FedEx’s ground delivery unit, adjusts its surcharges for every 9 cents-a-gallon move in the EIA diesel price.', 'For example, UPS’ upcoming 15.25% levy is based on an EIA-established price that is at least $4.10 a gallon but less than $4.22 a gallon. Currently, the levy is 14.75% for prices falling within that band.', 'UPS’ action will bring its levy on U.S. ground shipments in line with FedEx, which currently assesses a 15.25% surcharge within the same pricing band. Nate Skiver, founder of parcel consultancy LPF Spend Management LLC, said one of UPS’ goals is to achieve parity with FedEx’s surcharge pricing. The other is to boost revenue per package, which has taken a hit due to pricing pressure and changes in volume mix.', '“It also helps to set a higher floor on the fuel table, which is now relevant with diesel prices moderating,” Skiver said in a LinkedIn message.', 'UPS, FedEx and other parcel delivery carriers have wide latitude as to when they adjust diesel and jet fuel surcharges. In recent years, surcharges have remained elevated despite world price fluctuations that have headed south. Analysts who follow the fuel surcharge market have said that surcharge levels stay higher long after prices have dropped, thus allowing the carriers to reap additional revenue on each transaction.', 'Historically, small to mid-size shipper s have found it difficult to reduce fuel surcharges through negotiations, while bigger shippers have to tender certain volume minimums for the carriers to consider reducing the levies. However, in what has turned into an all-out price war as carriers aggressively bid for business, the carriers have let it be known that fuel surcharge discounts are very much on the table.', 'Domestic ground parcels are UPS’ largest business. SurePost is the name for a service provided in conjunction with the U.S. Postal Service in which UPS picks up and aggregates low-value, nonurgent parcels and inducts them deep into the postal infrastructure for last-mile delivery to residences.', 'The post UPS to hike US diesel surcharges under adjusted formula appeared first on FreightWaves.']"

In the case of American Express Co, the recent sale by Vice Chairman Jeffrey Campbell may raise questions among investors. Over the past year, Campbell has sold a total of 21,008 shares and has not made any purchases. This one-sided activity could suggest that the insider sees limited upside potential or perceives the stock to be fully valued at current levels."", ""However, it's important to consider the broader context of insider transactions at American Express Co. Over the past year, there has been only 1 insider buy compared to 10 insider sells. This trend might indicate a general consensus among insiders that the stock's growth prospects are not strong enough to warrant buying at current prices."", ""On the day of Campbell's recent sale, shares of American Express Co were trading at $168.33, giving the company a market cap of $124.45 billion. The price-earnings ratio stood at 16.02, which is higher than the industry median of 12.71 but lower than the company's historical median price-earnings ratio. This mixed signal suggests that while the stock may be slightly overvalued compared to its peers, it is undervalued in the context of its own historical performance."", 'Adding another layer to the valuation analysis, the price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.79 indicates that American Express Co is modestly undervalued based on its GF Value of $213.81. The GF Value is a proprietary intrinsic value estimate from GuruFocus, which factors in historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates.', ""The insider trend image above reflects the recent insider selling activity, which could be interpreted as a lack of confidence from insiders about the stock's future appreciation. However, investors should also consider the modest undervaluation suggested by the GF Value when forming their own investment thesis."", ""The GF Value image provides a visual representation of the stock's valuation relative to its intrinsic value. The current market price below the GF Value could represent an opportunity for investors who believe in the long-term fundamentals of the company, despite the recent insider selling activity."", ""Jeffrey Campbell's recent sale of 21,008 shares of American Express Co is a significant event that warrants attention. While insider selling can be a red flag for potential investors, it is essential to analyze the transaction in the context of the company's valuation, historical performance, and future prospects. With American Express Co's stock appearing modestly undervalued according to the GF Value, investors may find an opportunity amidst the insider selling trend.

On November 27, 2023, the insider sold 3,000 shares of the company, a transaction that has caught the attention of investors and market analysts alike.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 2 Warning Sign with RMD.', ""Brett Sandercock has been a key figure at ResMed Inc, serving as the company's CFO. With a tenure that has spanned over several years, Sandercock has been instrumental in steering the financial strategies and health of the company. His role involves overseeing the global finance team, managing financial risks, financial planning and reporting, as well as being a strategic partner in the overall growth and direction of the company. His decisions and actions are closely watched by investors as they can provide insights into the company's financial stability and future prospects."", ""ResMed Inc is a San Diego-based medical equipment company known for its innovative products in the sleep and respiratory medicine field. The company's offerings include devices such as CPAP machines for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea, ventilators, and other respiratory support products. ResMed's commitment to improving quality of life for those with sleep apnea, COPD, and other chronic diseases has positioned it as a leader in a growing healthcare market. With a focus on connected care solutions, ResMed leverages technology and data to deliver better clinical outcomes for patients and efficiencies for healthcare providers."", ""Insider transactions, particularly those involving high-ranking executives like CFOs, can provide valuable clues about a company's financial health and future performance. Over the past year, Brett Sandercock has sold a total of 33,000 shares and has not made any purchases. This pattern of selling could suggest various things, from personal financial planning to a less optimistic view of the company's valuation or growth prospects."", ""However, it's important to note that insider sells can be motivated by many factors and do not always indicate a lack of confidence in the company. Executives may sell shares for personal reasons such as diversifying their investment portfolio, funding personal expenses, or tax planning. Therefore, while insider sells can be a red flag, they must be interpreted within a broader context."", ""When examining the relationship between insider transactions and stock price, it's crucial to consider the overall trend of insider behavior. For ResMed Inc, there have been 39 insider sells and no insider buys over the past year. This trend could be perceived as a lack of insider confidence in the stock's future appreciation."", 'On the day of Sandercocks recent sell, ResMed Inc shares were trading at $152.62, giving the company a market cap of $23.312 billion. The price-earnings ratio stood at 25.73, which is lower than both the industry median of 30.74 and the companys historical median price-earnings ratio. This could indicate that the stock is undervalued compared to its peers and its own historical valuation.', 'Adding to the valuation analysis, the price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.55 suggests that ResMed Inc is significantly undervalued based on its GF Value. The GF Value is an intrinsic value estimate that takes into account historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. With a price of $152.62 and a GF Value of $277.99, the stock appears to be trading well below its estimated intrinsic value.', ""The insider trend image above provides a visual representation of the selling pattern by insiders at ResMed Inc. This consistent selling could be a point of concern for potential investors, as it may signal that those with the most intimate knowledge of the company's workings are choosing to reduce their holdings."", 'The GF Value image further illustrates the discrepancy between the current stock price and the estimated intrinsic value, reinforcing the notion that the stock may be undervalued.', ""While the recent insider sell by CFO Brett Sandercock may raise questions among investors, it is essential to consider the broader context of the company's valuation and market performance. ResMed Inc's strong position in the medical equipment industry, combined with its focus on innovation and connected care, provides a solid foundation for future growth. Despite the insider selling trend, the company's current valuation metrics suggest that the stock may be an attractive investment opportunity for those who believe in the company's long-term potential. As always, investors should conduct their own due diligence and consider their investment goals and risk tolerance before making any investment decisions."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Before that, that was ExxonMobil doing that $60 billion deal to buy Pioneer Natural Resources. So there's this space for these players to try to get bigger through acquisition, Josh."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. Certainly, so you look at this player in particular, when you talk about CrownRock, big private oil and gas producer in the Permian Basin, North America's, of course, big source of crude there. And really just the latest deal in this sector, as you were sort of suggesting there, Diane. Oil companies, they've got a lot of cash. And they have been putting that to work. I mean, Exxon's $60 billion deal for Pioneer. Chevron, of course, the $53 billion takeover of Hess. So we've seen some real headline-making deal activity in this space."", ""DIANE KING HALL: Yeah, indeed. And we know Occidental is favored by Warren Buffett. So it's got, you know, a legendary investor behind that company. And CrownRock makes about or they produce about 150,000 barrels of oil a day. So they certainly have some strength in their wheelhouse there."", ""JOSH LIPTON: All right. Moving on here, let's check out Ford. It was falling today after the auto giant lowered its profit guidance due to labor costs after signing a deal with the UAW. So this one, this is about the financial guidance, bottom line. They lowered their profit guidance. It's going to come in lower than what they had predicted, because those labor costs, the new contract, of course, with the UAW."", ""So now Ford says they're going to be looking for 2023 adjusted earnings before interest and taxes. They're shooting for between 10 and 10.5 billion. It had been estimated at between 11 and 12 billion."", ""DIANE KING HALL: Yeah, that's right. That's right. I mean, and the forecast they're saying it also includes about $1.7 billion in lost profit. That's from the strike. They're estimating that's going to impact vehicle sales as well, leading to about 100,000 units fewer wholesale vehicle sales. So Ford certainly following in the footsteps of GM and in terms of their forecasts as well. And we knew that strike was going to have an impact on production, on the numbers, for both of these for-- well, several carmakers in general."", ""And we know that it was a tense negotiation process with the unions. And the carmakers had to put a lot on the table to get this deal across the line. And so we know that's also going to add about $900 in labor costs per vehicle by 2028. That's what Ford is saying. Ford saying is working to offset those costs by making cuts elsewhere."", ""And we want to look at another player in the vehicle space, this time in the EV space. VinFast shares are rallying today, jumping more than 11% after the company announced it will showcase its latest model the VF9 EV at the COP28 climate conference. So it's getting some play-- some action today. It's been really volatile stocks since it went public through a special purpose acquisition company earlier this year. That was back in August. I mean, they saw as high as $82 a share at its peak. And at that time, this was wild, I remember us covering that. And at the time, it was like the third most valuable car company, which was wild, I mean, for this new public debut company."", ""They lost money in 2021 then pivoted to EVs. And that's where they are now."", ""JOSH LIPTON: Yeah. I mean, the broader-- this stock is it can be very volatile. I mean, the broader story to me, Diane, that's so interesting is just when you look at this EV market right now and how consumer demand does seem to be waning, you're watching these EV makers slashing prices. They're putting off billions in EV-related investment. I just wonder, did investors maybe get a little too ambitious and aggressive when they kind of mapped out and thought about what EV adoption was really going to look like? Because it does look like there is a kind of adjustment going on here."", ""DIANE KING HALL: And I mean, that's been the concern across the country just about the infrastructure behind wider EV adoption just really isn't there yet with regard to the electric vehicle space. One thing I also want to note in terms of coverage of VinFast, only a couple analysts have initiated coverage. One of them friend of show, Dan Ives, who has initiated coverage with an outperform rating recently and a $12 price target."", ""So in terms of its gain today, it's still got some room to get there with regard to what Dan Ives is looking for. He sees this, you know, just both the growth of it being an international player. And that's where he sees some strength for the company, although its home base is, obviously, in Vietnam.""]"

I'll start today with comments about our CFO transition plans and then discuss our third quarter performance. Then Scott will review the financial results and our outlook. Starting with the succession plans we announced this afternoon. After nearly 20 years with Ulta Beauty and more than a decade as CFO, Scott Settersten, has shared with us his decision to retire, effective April 1, 2024. From his early days helping take Ulta Beauty public, and throughout the last 10 years as CFO, Scott's impact on Ulta Beauty has been tremendous. He's been a passionate steward of our business and the strong and constant shareholder returns achieved during his tenure are a testament to his leadership and disciplined approach to driving profitable growth. I want to express my sincere gratitude to Scott for his partnership and his remarkable contributions to our business. He has been an exceptional partner to me and an inspirational leader for our team across the company. With Scott's retirement, I'm very pleased to announce that Paula Oyibo will be our next Chief Financial Officer. Paula is a dynamic finance executive with broad industry experience, and I am confident she is the right leader for this next chapter of Ulta Beauty's growth. Since joining the company in 2019, she has established herself as a trusted partner and visionary leader. Her deep understanding of our business, experience leading large finance organizations and strong commitment to nurturing talent with an inclusive culture make her the ideal person to serve as Ulta Beauty's next CFO. Paula will be a great addition to our dynamic executive team, and I look forward to partnering with her as we continue our growth journey. This announcement represents another great succession story for Ulta Beauty. I am grateful to Scott for being intentional and thoughtful in ensuring we have a seamless plan for this critical leadership role. And I am excited that Paula will bring her business-first mindset, influence and energy to the executive team. Okay. Now let's talk about our third quarter performance. The Ulta Beauty team delivered strong performance again this quarter, with sales, gross profit and EPS all exceeding our internal expectations. Our traffic trends remain healthy. Our brand awareness and loyalty program reached all-time highs, and our transformational initiatives are on track. I want to thank all Ulta Beauty associates for maintaining their focus on creating great guest experiences and delivering these results while executing against our transformational agenda. For the quarter, net sales increased 6.4% to $2.5 billion. Operating profit was 13.1% of sales and diluted EPS was $5.07 per share. Comparable sales increased 4.5%. As discussed on prior calls, we expected the sales growth to moderate from the first half as we lapped 2 years of strong double-digit comp growth. Comp sales growth for the quarter was driven by approximately 10% growth from our digital channels. Stores delivered low single-digit comps as we lapped high-teen growth last year. Store traffic remained healthy, increasing in the high single-digit range. Turning to performance by category. Skincare was again our fastest-growing category, driven by double-digit growth in mass and prestige segments. Beauty enthusiasts have maintained their skincare routines while also experimenting with new regimens. Consumer interest in moisturizers, serums and cleansers is driving growth, and brands leading into these trends like Drunk Elephant, Good Molecules and COSRX contributed to our strong results. Dermatologist-recommended brands also continued to resonate, driving growth for brands like La Roche-Posay, Cetaphil and Dermalogica. The fragrance and bath category delivered low double-digit growth. Newness from Ariana Grande, Burberry and YSL contributed to the category's performance. Prestige brands, Valentino and Carolina Herrera, and luxury brands, CHANEL and Dior also drove meaningful growth. Sales in the makeup category were flat, with mid-single-digit growth in mass makeup offsetting a modest decline in prestige makeup. New brands like Dior and NATASHA DENONA and Beautycounter and existing brands with compelling newness and innovation, including e.l.f., Juvia's Place, MAC and OPI, all delivered growth during the quarter. While many mass brands continue to benefit from engaging newness and social engagement, our prestige makeup business was more challenged as we continue to lap the strong impact of last year's Fenty launch. Finally, Comp sales for the hair care category decreased in the low single-digit range, primarily driven by a decline in hair tools. Newer brands, including exclusive brand LolaVie and Shark Beauty and Donna's Recipe as well as newness from Not Your Mother's and [Way] deliver growth for the category. Trend-relevant products from Redken and Biolage resonated strongly with guests while social virality drove growth for IGK and Mielle. Comparing to mass beauty dollar sales for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, and we continue to outpace the growth of the mass market according to Circana data. In prestige beauty, our share gains in skin care and fragrance were offset by softness in makeup and hair according to Circana. From a channel perspective, we gained prestige beauty share across digital channels, but were more challenged in brick-and-mortar channels, reflecting the impact of increased distribution for prestige beauty. While these dynamics increased competitive intensity in the short term, we are confident our sales-driving strategies will support our ability to capture more market share over the long term.Our services business delivered high single-digit comp growth, primarily driven by engagement in core services, including haircuts, blowouts and makeup services. Ear piercing, one of our newer services also performed well, and salon backbar takeovers, which give our stylists an opportunity to introduce brands to guests continue to drive product attachment and new guest acquisition for participating brands. Unlike other discretionary retail categories, the U.S. beauty category has consistently driven growth over time. Based on data from Euromonitor, in the 15 years prior to the pandemic, the U.S. beauty category grew in the low to mid-single-digit range every year except during the Great Recession when the category experienced low single-digit declines and in 2020 when the category declined 6%. In 2021 and 2022, the category experienced unprecedented double-digit growth as consumers recovered from the pandemic. And as we lap the strong growth this year, consumer spend has remained healthy. While we expect growth will continue to normalize to historic ranges, we remain confident the category will continue to grow, barring a macroeconomic event. In addition to factors that have driven the category historically, including a strong emotional connection with consumers, newness and innovation, and societal changes, today, consumers are thinking differently about the role beauty can play in their wellness routine, which we believe will drive increased usage for the category. As we think about the opportunity to expand our market leadership and drive long-term profitable growth, our strategic framework guides our priorities and focus. Let me share some highlights and the progress made this quarter. Starting with our efforts to drive growth with an expanded definition of All Things Beauty. During the quarter, we enhanced our assortment with trend relevant brands in every category. In makeup, we introduced luxury brand, Pat McGrath Labs, expanded our presence with MAC to nearly all stores, launched several exclusive and innovative brands, including Half Magic, Polite Society and Rabanne.In skin care, we launched PanOxyl, a dermatologist-recommended brand popular with Gen Z. In haircare, we launched Shark Beauty, an innovative brand of hair styling tools at accessible price points. And in fragrance, we launched Snif, an emerging brand offering gender-neutral sense available only at Ulta Beauty.Building on our long-term partnership with CHANEL and other luxury fragrance brands, we see an opportunity to expand our luxury offering into makeup and skincare. In Q1, we launched luxury at Ulta Beauty and our member analytics confirms that our new luxury assortment is driving incrementality and increased spend per member. In addition to strengthening our core assortment, we are leaning into broader trends in beauty through our cross-category platforms. We continue to expand our Conscious Beauty platform. At the end of the quarter, more than half of our brand portfolio was certified in at least one pillar, with 260 brands certified in more than one pillar. Newly-certified brands include COSRX, Loving Tan and Polite Society. We also increased our portfolio of BIPOC brands, welcoming Pat McGrath Labs, CurlMix, Better World Fragrance House by Drake and Pound Cake to the portfolio. And we expanded our wellness assortment with the launch of at-home spa tools from LUV SCRUB, Solawave and Skin Gym. In addition, we expanded the wellness shop to an additional 500 stores and refresh the presentation with elevated aesthetics, improved navigation and more storytelling graphics to inspire and educate our guests how to connect to wellness in their everyday lives. Guests are moving effortlessly between physical and digital channels, and we are investing to enhance the guest experience across all touch points. We have been on a multiyear digital transformation journey to upgrade our infrastructure and deliver a more engaging and seamless digital guest experience while also positioning future growth.In August, we completed a significant step in this process with the transition of our digital commerce experience, including cart (inaudible), checkout and member account data to our new architecture.Overall, our team successfully executed these changes, and I am pleased to report our new digital experience performed very well over the high demand Thanksgiving weekend, including Cyber Monday. The modernization of our digital technology ecosystem is nearly complete, enabling us to elevate and optimize our existing guest experience while driving digital innovation, utilizing a modern, agile approach. In addition to our digital platforms, we are also enhancing our in-store experiences. Our member data demonstrates that an excellent guest experience drives spend, increased frequency and creates lasting loyalty. This quarter, we launched a refreshed guest engagement model, which elevates the guest experience through authentic engagement, helpful experiences and friendly interactions to create a genuine human connection. While still early, we are encouraged by the improving trends in guest satisfaction scores. We continue to expand and enhance the Ulta Beauty at Target experience. We opened 89 Ulta Beauty at Target shops during the quarter, ending the quarter with 510 shops. This quarter, we were excited to launch Fenty Beauty, delighting our guests with a new way to shop this fan favorite brand. Created exclusively for Ulta Beauty at Target, the Fenty snacks assortment features a curated lineup of best-selling must-haves, minis, and unique sets. And just in time for holiday, we launched a curated assortment of Dyson hair tools in select stores and exclusive holiday sample kits in all Ulta Beauty at Target shops. Beauty is an emotionally-driven category, and we are investing to drive greater love, loyalty and connection with Ulta Beauty. We continue to strengthen the Ulta Beauty brand, unaided brand awareness increased to a record level this quarter with meaningful gains among Gen Z and millennial beauty consumers. We also expanded the connection guest field for Ulta Beauty as measured by significant growth in brand love. These gains reflect the impact of our strategic brand building efforts as well as our marketing actions to support key promotional events and brand launches. At Ulta Beauty, our mission is to use the power of beauty to bring to light the possibilities that lie within each of us. Building on our commitment to make beauty as a force for good, we've created the Joy Project, a multiyear initiative to make beauty and the world a more joyful place. We launched The Joy Project in September with an integrated campaign across national TV, PR, social media and our owned channels. In addition, we created a training curriculum for transforming the way our associates think about self-confidence, and to give them tools to empower our guests to do the same. In October, we expanded The Joy Project while reinforcing our role at the intersection of beauty and culture as the exclusive beauty partner for TikTok's first ever beauty month. Grounded in TikTok's theme of reclaimed joy. This month-long activation, leveraged creator content and events, premium platform advertising placements and custom filters that allowed users to see their inner joy. We continue to adjust our promotional strategies as the category normalizes and consumers navigate rising cost pressures. Responding to consumer needs and competitive shifts, we continue to evolve our key tentpole events like 21 Days of Beauty, while also deploying new offers with more relevant storytelling to drive sales and traffic. While our promotional activity increased this quarter, our targeting capabilities and promo optimization efforts enabled us to manage the financial impact. Notably, overall promotional levels remained meaningfully below 2019 levels. Turning to our loyalty program. We ended the quarter with 42.2 million active members, 8% higher than last year, driven primarily by improving member retention and new member acquisition. Spend per member remains healthy, driven by greater shopper frequency. As we engage members with exclusive promotions, point accelerators and personalized content and recommendations, we are driving engagement spend and frequency. These targeted efforts are also enabling us to elevate more members to our platinum and diamond tiers. Compared to last year, the number of platinum and diamond members has increased more than 20%. Turning now to our efforts to drive operational excellence and optimization. We are executing a multiyear transformation agenda intended to unlock new capabilities and efficiencies to fuel our growth. In addition to the digital store progress achieved this quarter, we continued to advance our road map in other key areas. We completed the retrofit of our Greenwood distribution center began shipping to stores and fulfilling e-commerce orders from our new Greer market fulfillment center and transitioned our Chambersburg distribution center to our new ERP platform.Our teams have delivered several major milestones this year, and we are on track to complete many of our transformational projects next year. We plan to complete the transition of our digital store in the first half of 2024, and we expect to complete the upgrade of our ERP platform and the expansion of our data management systems in the second half of 2024. We will advance our supply chain optimization efforts next year with the continuation of our Dallas DC retrofit, as well as the conversion of our Romeoville, Illinois fast fulfillment center to a new market fulfillment center. Finally, as the nation's leading specialty beauty retailer, we strive to be good stewards of our environment. Reflecting our commitment to leave a positive legacy, I am excited to share we have established a mission reduction goals approved by the science-based target initiative. Details of our commitments are available in the ESG section of our investor website. Shifting now to our plans and expectations for holiday. The holiday is off to a good start. But we know the biggest selling weeks are still ahead of us. Our insights suggest that consumers are ready to celebrate even as they navigate in an uncertain economic environment. With our diverse assortments and convenient omnichannel touch points, we are well positioned to help our guests celebrate this season. Our holiday campaign this year is the gift is just the beginning, which underscores our belief in the power of beauty and Ulta Beauty. While a gift can be a signature fragrance or an innovative hair tool, beauty can also be the gift of self-care, fun and joy. Through this campaign, we're celebrating the moments that make the holiday special, family, friends, connections, joy and pairing them with the perfect gifts.Our merchants have thoughtfully created a holiday assortment of exclusive first-to-market items along with iconic classics. With products across mass, prestige and luxury, we offer guests both value-first and splurge-worthy items to help them find perfect budget-friendly guests for others or themselves. Our store teams are ready to bring the holiday to life for our guests. Our new POS system enables associates to easily order items not currently available in their store and our new mobile POS tools provide guests with an elevated and faster checkout process. And with BOPUS and same-day delivery options in every store, it's never been easier or more convenient to shop at Ulta Beauty. Our teams have been working hard all year to ensure Ulta Beauty is ready to bring joy to our guests this holiday season, and I am proud of how well they are executing for our guests. While the beauty category will likely be a bit more promotional this holiday season, I'm confident our marketing and assortment strategies combined with new capabilities will position us to deliver another successful holiday.In closing, the beauty category remains healthy, and consumer engagement remains high. We remain confident in the resilience and power of beauty and in our ability to drive market share and profitable growth. And now I will turn the call over to Scott for a discussion of the financial results. Scott?"", 'Scott M. Settersten', ""Thanks, Dave. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to echo Dave's sentiments and thank the Ulta Beauty team for delivering third quarter financial results that were ahead of our internal expectations. Solid sales growth supported by strong guest traffic and new store sales performance helped to mitigate some of the unique margin pressures we faced in the third quarter and enabled us to deliver gross margin modestly ahead of plan. SG&A spend was in line with expectations, resulting in operating margin of 13.1%. Turning to the P&L. Net sales for the quarter increased 6.4%, driven by 4.5% growth in comp sales, strong new store performance and solid growth in other revenue. Transactions for the quarter increased 5.9%, driven by healthy traffic across both channels. Average ticket decreased 1.4% as the decline in average units per transaction more than offset the impact of a higher average selling price. While retail price increases remain a benefit to our comp performance, the overall environment continues to normalize, and we are seeing the extraordinary pricing benefits from last year continue to roll off. We estimate price increases contributed less than 200 basis points to the overall comp in the third quarter. During the quarter, we opened 12 new stores and relocated 2 stores. In addition, we remodeled 11 stores. Q3 gross margin decreased 130 basis points to 39.9%, compared to 41.2% last year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower merchandise margin, higher inventory shrink and higher supply chain costs which were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue. Overall merchandise margin was lower primarily due to lapping the timing benefit of retail price changes last year, as well as increased promotional activity this year. While promotional activity continues to normalize, the overall financial impact remains meaningfully below 2019 levels. Inventory shrink continued to be a headwind. Our efforts to address shrink appear to be stabilizing the impact, but the overall environment remains challenging. In addition to new fragrance fixtures, which have been installed in nearly 3/4 of the store fleet, we continue to invest in associate training, staffing and operational improvements to mitigate the impact of shrink. And we continue to work with our retail industry partners to influence macro changes aimed at improving the overall environment. Supply chain costs were higher during the quarter, reflecting depreciation related to investments in our supply chain transformation, as well as the recent opening of our new market fulfillment center in South Carolina. These gross margin pressures were partially offset by strong growth in other revenue, primarily due to growth in both credit card income and royalty income from our Target partnership. SG&A increased 10.8% to $661.4 million. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased 110 basis points to 26.6%, compared to 25.5% last year, primarily due to higher corporate overhead, greater store expenses, investments in store payroll and benefits as well as higher marketing expense which more than offset lower incentive compensation. Corporate overhead expenses were higher in the quarter primarily due to investments related to our strategic priorities, including Project SOAR, Digital Store, other IT capabilities and UB Media. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we have invested about 75% of our planned $60 million to $70 million of incremental spend to support our strategic initiatives. Store expenses were higher in the quarter, reflecting ongoing inflationary pressures across the business. The increase in store payroll and benefits was primarily due to the impact of planned investments in average wage rates. Higher marketing expenses in the quarter were largely driven by increased investments to drive member acquisition, loyalty and brand awareness across key channels, including social, video and streaming. Lower incentive compensation was a benefit in the quarter, reflecting operational performance that is more in line with our internal targets compared to last year's significant outperformance. Operating income for the quarter declined 9.6% to $327.2 million. As a percentage of sales, operating margin decreased 240 basis points to 13.1% compared to 15.5% last year. Diluted earnings per share decreased 5.1% to $5.07 per share compared to $5.34 per share last year. Turning to the balance sheet and cash flow statements. Total inventory increased 9.8% to $2.3 billion, compared to $2.1 billion last year. In addition to the impact of 31 additional stores, the increase reflects inventory to support higher demand and the stocking of our new market fulfillment center in South Carolina, as well as new brand launches and product cost increases. Capital expenditures were $106 million for the quarter, reflecting investments in new and existing stores as well as supply chain and IT investments to support our transformational agenda. Depreciation was $61.4 million in the quarter compared to $58.5 million last year. We repurchased approximately 687,000 shares at a cost of $281.5 million. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 1.8 million shares at a cost of $840.5 million. During the quarter, we drew on our revolving credit facility to support our ongoing capital allocation priorities, including share repurchases and capital expenditures during the period in the year when our working capital needs peak as we build inventory for holiday. I would note our recent activity does not reflect a change in our capital allocation philosophy rather a lever to short support short-term cash needs. We ended the quarter with $195.4 million in short-term debt and $121.8 million in cash and cash equivalents. Moving to our outlook. We are narrowing our sales and EPS guidance for fiscal 2023 to reflect our actual performance through the first 3 quarters of the year and our expectations for Q4. We expect net sales for the year will be between $11.1 billion and $11.15 billion, with comp sales growth between 5% and 5.5%. For the year, we continue to plan to open approximately 25 to 30 net new stores and remodel or relocate 20 to 30 stores. Our expectations for operating margin for the year remains unchanged, at between 14.6% and 14.8% of sales, with deleverage to come from both gross margin and SG&A, with slightly more deleverage coming from SG&A. Reflecting these assumptions, we now expect diluted EPS for the year will be between $25.20 and $25.60. We have refined our expectations for Q4 to reflect the expected resilience of the beauty category as well as potential risks from cautious consumer spending, increased points of distribution for prestige beauty and higher promotional activity. We continue to expect comp sales will be flat to up modestly for the fourth quarter. We still have several important weeks left in the holiday season and the operating environment continues to be dynamic. In addition, we are lapping the exceptional results last year, including an incredibly strong January, which was our strongest monthly comp sales performance of fiscal 2022. For modeling purposes, we now expect gross margin to deleverage modestly and operating margin to be flat to down compared to last year. One final update. We now expect to spend between $400 million and $425 million in CapEx in fiscal 2023, including approximately $180 million for supply chain and IT, $170 million for new stores, remodels and merchandise fixtures, and about $60 million for store maintenance and other. We expect depreciation for the year will be around $245 million. We now expect share repurchases to be approximately $950 million.Our teams delivered another solid quarter amidst a dynamic operating environment. As we look ahead, we are focused on delivering our plans for the holiday season and finalizing our plans for next year. We will share more about our expectations for fiscal 2024 when we report our year-end results. But we remain confident. We are well positioned to deliver performance in line with our financial targets of 3% to 5% comp sales growth and 14% to 15% operating margin, with EPS growth next year, reflecting the lapping of an extra week in fiscal 2023. Before I turn it over to our operator to moderate the Q&A, I want to take a moment to say thank you. It has been an honor and a privilege to serve as CFO for this special company for more than a decade. I look forward to passing the baton to Paula Oyibo, who I've worked with closely over the last several years. We will continue to work together over the coming months to ensure a smooth transition. Thank you again. And now I'll turn the call back over to our operator to moderate the Q&A session."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Dana Telsey with Telsey Advisory Group.', 'Dana Lauren Telsey', ""Hello, everyone, and congratulations on the nice results. And Scott, congratulations on such a wonderful tenure at Ulta, and looking forward to your next chapter. And Paula, congratulations on the new role.As all of you think about the beauty category, which obviously is such resiliency in your sales up around 6%. How do you feel on the category trends with makeup and what we see there as that evolves going into next year, product newness, pricing? How do you parse it together?And looking at the gross margin and SG&A levers, the lower merchandise margin that you had and the higher shrink, how do you see that evolving going forward? And what's changing in the promotional and pricing area?"", 'David C. Kimbell', ""Great. Well, thanks for those nice comments about Scott and Paula, and I appreciate that. And I'll start with some thoughts about the beauty category and makeup specifically, to answer your question there, and then maybe Scott can pick up on the gross margin. As I mentioned in my comments, we remain very confident about the long-term future of the beauty category for all the reasons I highlighted, a steady stream of compelling newness, high level of engagement, emotional connection. The connection between wellness and beauty that's stronger than ever coming out of the pandemic give us confidence more broadly in beauty.And then makeup specifically, is an important part of that. And while the makeup category for us was essentially flat for the quarter. We are confident in the future of that important part of our business. We see strong positive trends, a high level of engagement across all demographic groups. And as we get into both completing this fourth quarter and moving into next year, we're confident in what will drive -- driving our makeup business. Some of the actions that we've taken specifically and make up to drive this business forward, continuing to launch several new exclusive makeup brands, brands like Half Magic, which was created by the Euphoria makeup artist. Polite Society, a prestige brand, exclusive again to Ulta, from the creators of Too Faced. Rabanne, which is a contemporary Spanish fashion brand, launching into cosmetics exclusively at Ulta. We're just getting started with those three exclusive brands at Ulta Beauty.We continue to see strength with MAC, and we've expanded that into nearly all doors. Strong growth on key mass brands like e.l.f. and with great compelling innovation within that segment of the makeup business.I talked in my remarks about luxury and we're -- while we've expanded that throughout the year, we feel like we're just getting started there. We launched -- expanded CHANEL, launched Dior and NATASHA DENONA this year, and then added Pat McGrath in the third quarter. In new items with existing brands continue to make a difference in the category and we're confident in what's ahead. A couple of recent examples. Tarte's Shape Tape, Radiant Concealer, exclusive at Ulta Beauty. Juvia's Place, blush liquid -- blushes, exclusive at Ulta. And newness from other existing brands like Clinique, Benefit, Anastasia, NYX, Maybelline, go down the list. So we're confident. We're lapping the biggest launch we had with Fenty from 2022. But as we look forward, we see both the items that we've launched and more newness coming as we enter into 2024 we're confident and optimistic both in the consumer engagement and makeup and beauty in general and our specific strategies to drive growth. Scott, do you want to talk about margins?"", 'Scott M. Settersten', ""Sure. Thanks, Dana. So I give you a little bit more maybe than you were thinking about when you initially put this question together because I'm sure it's on other investors' minds as well. So thinking about '24 and beyond. And again, this is directional in no particular order, but I kind of start with the headwinds. So supply chain transformation will continue to be a tougher compare for us as we think about next year as we continue to build out in and work through our distribution centers across the country.E-commerce mix, we've talked about, again, it's been a bit of a benefit for us the last couple of years. We expect e-commerce to grow at a higher rate than brick-and-mortar, next year and the years to come, and so that will be a headwind for us in gross margin. Again, we've got ways to mitigate that now, that we didn't have back in 2019, namely BOPIS, ship from store and same-day delivery. So those would be the headwinds. I'd say promotionality is something I call kind of TBD. So again, 2023 has been a bit of a deleverage point for us because we're getting back into a more normal environment. It's yet to be seen on how 2024 will shake out. So that's something we'll have to navigate. On the plus side, you mentioned a couple. Well, other revenue, #1, again, 2023, it's been a big tailwind for us. We would expect that to continue, although moderating a bit in '24. Cycling over price increases this year has been a major headwind to the business in the gross margin line. That will moderate as we get into -- deeper into 2024 and cycle through some of that.Shrink, we called out third quarter. We we're gaining on it a little bit. Again, it's not mission accomplished by any stretch of the imagination, but we do feel like we've got tactics in place now that will help us get that better managed. UB Media as that business continues to scale up, we expect that to be a margin benefit for us and then, of course, fixed cost. Again, in the third quarter, a bit of an anomaly with some of the repair and maintenance expenses that we absorb, but over the long term, we expect to be able to kind of leverage fixed store cost on a 3x to 5x."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Lorraine Hutchinson with Bank of America.', 'Lorraine Corrine Maikis Hutchinson', ""You mentioned some brick-and-mortar share loss in prestige in the quarter. Can you talk about strategies, brand launches, marketing that you're working on to defend the sharing and return to growth?"", 'David C. Kimbell', ""Yes. Thanks for the question, Lorraine. Yes, yes, we -- it is our objective to gain share across all parts of our business, and we did -- we feel positive about that in many parts, including our mass business, our prestige skin care, our prestige fragrance business, our prestige e-commerce business. But brick-and-mortar was pressured. And we think that's largely due to expanded points of distribution. There are hundreds more brick-and-mortar locations in the market now than there were even just a couple of years ago. And -- but what we see is more of a short-term impact from this competitive -- kind of the competitive pressure. Historically, as we've seen new locations open near our existing locations, there's a short-term modest impact. But relatively quickly, our stores are able to rebound and recover and to drive growth, share growth over time. So largely, what we're seeing, and we're confident in the path ahead that our strategies, our holistic strategies and everything that we're doing across our assortment, across our brand engagement, our loyalty program, and then certainly, the human experience that we uniquely deliver in our stores give us a lot of confidence that while there's some short-term pressure year-over-year, we're still stronger in share than we were pre-pandemic, and we're confident in growth behind our strategies going forward."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Mark Altschwager with Baird.', 'Mark R. Altschwager', 'Scott and Paula, congratulations to each of you. So for the Q4, you mentioned that you refined your outlook given some of the risk to consumer spending and endpoints of distribution. I guess, but overall, you are raising the low end of your guide, Q3 a bit better than your internal expectations. So maybe just give us a little bit more detail on how your views on category spending and the promotional backdrop have changed versus 3 months ago?', 'David C. Kimbell', ""Yes. I would -- yes, so I'll start, and let Scott give a little insight here. When we look at the promotional environment, maybe I'll start there, Mark. The -- as we highlighted in the third quarter, the promotional environment was higher in Q3 than a year ago, but still meaningfully below 2019 levels. So while we're seeing some increase, it's -- we don't see an irrational promotional market. We're definitely not back to 2019 levels. And we've been able to leverage our capabilities behind CRM and overall personalization to manage more effectively within our promotional intensity. So with that backdrop, as we look into the fourth quarter, again, we're not expecting anything radically different than what we saw, a bit more promotional, not irrational to what we've essentially seen so far, not back to 2019 levels. And when we look at our outlook, and I'll let Scott give a little bit more color, we really haven't changed our fourth quarter comp sales. As we've been talking for a while, we've seen -- we expected in the second half of this year for comp to moderate to low single digits. We were a bit ahead of that in the third quarter, and we're still confident in our outlook for the fourth quarter, and that gave us -- really our third quarter performance gave us the confidence to move up the bottom end of that range. So as we look out, we're not anticipating any major disruptions from promotion. But Scott mentioned the biggest weeks of holiday are still ahead. So we're staying close to that. The consumer engagement, we're positive about, and that's reflected in our updated refined outlook going forward."", 'Scott M. Settersten', ""And I would just reiterate what Dave said, our fourth quarter comp sales expectations have not changed, all right? We are giving ourselves a little bit wider range, I would say, on operating margin than you would probably expect to see at this stage of the year. But it is $1 billion above the last couple of quarters. So small changes in consumer reaction could have a bigger impact on our business. So we're just being prudent, giving ourselves room to maneuver, I guess, I would say. Thinking about how we deliver overall great experience for the guests, both in the store and online. And again, we feel like we're really well positioned. We're off to a good start, but there's still a long way to go."", 'Operator', 'And our next question comes from the line of Michael Binetti with Evercore ISI.', 'Michael Charles Binetti', ""Scott, you may have my congrats. It's been great, the conversations over the years has been wonderful, and Paula cannot wait to work with you.Dave, you reminded us how resilient the category is in the low to mid-single-digit growth over time. The comp (inaudible) for the fourth quarter allows comps to go as low as flat, so below the algo, below the industry rate. I know there's some unique hurdles that you pointed to. Is that really the only impediment to a normal return to normal comp is the hurdles in January effect that you pointed to?And then I'm also curious with SG&A growing double digits this quarter. Scott, you mentioned algo comp next year. Can you just kind of walk us through how to get to leverage on SG&A given the recent growth rate in the SG&A line?"", 'David C. Kimbell', ""Yes, I'll start with comp. But yes, I think you've said it well, we're -- again, when we look long term, very confident in the total growth of the category and our ability to gain share. That's certainly our objective all the time as we look in the fourth quarter, it's a -- we are lapping a very strong fourth quarter last year. We anticipated this. We've been talking about a moderation in our comp trends all year long. And so far, it's played out essentially, as we thought with some modest improvement, a little bit ahead of that, but that's how we anticipated.So when we look into the fourth quarter, what's reflected in our outlook is continued strong engagement, a successful holiday and healthy comps certainly on a 2-, 3-year basis, but we're lapping some strong performance last year as we get through this fourth quarter."", 'Scott M. Settersten', ""And Michael, we're in the midst of a multiyear transformation on many fronts across the business that, again, we expect to deliver significant efficiencies and optimization opportunities for our business for many years to come. And so 2023 is an extraordinary investment year. A lot of it is coming through the SG&A line, again, the $60 million to $70 million, on top of $50 million last year, again, we believe we're at or near the peak of that third quarter for a large brunt of the burden for 2023. So we would expect SG&A growth to moderate in '24 and beyond.And -- but I would remind folks, again, when you're just calling out the SG&A line, we have said consistently, we're willing to invest in SG&A as long as we can deliver operating margin leverage. So again, UB Media is a good example of that. It costs money, people cost, tool cost and things to ramp up there over time, but we get back in the gross margin line over the long term. So we're well positioned for the future and believe we're on the right track."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Oliver Chen with TD Cowen.', 'Oliver Chen', ""David, Paula and Scott, it's been awesome to work with you. Congrats on everything you've done in the years ahead.As you think about stores and the store maximum potential you've had really nice new store productivity and also pretty extraordinary e-commerce growth. What are you thinking about for smaller format and also as you continue to modernize the experience, how the stores should be laid out?And then second, on UB Media, a big part of the future is digital advertising. What's the path there in terms of what you're doing? It feels -- we believe that a lot of the brands do appreciate the data that you have and the cross-section you can offer them as well."", 'David C. Kimbell', ""Yes. Thanks, Oliver. I'll start with stores. We continue to reiterate our outlook of 1,500 to 1,700 stores, and towards -- and we've said that we believe we'll be towards the high end of that range, and that hasn't changed, and we're confident in that. And that does not include our expansion in partnership with Target. And as I mentioned in the call, we're up to 510 of those locations.Our store-level earnings, our store profitability remains very healthy. We're very positive about the new store opening performance, and we're confident in the opportunity to continue to expand our presence.We have a couple of things that you highlighted. We've been testing and I'd say, expanding really a smaller format, which is a 5,000 square foot store that's really targeted towards smaller markets, more remote markets, and we're having good success there. We've updated our full store layout that we've expanded into -- I think it's maybe 80 stores now or so that all new stores and some remodels that have a new format that makes it more intuitive to shop the whole store.The categories are bundled together. The services are highlighted more, the brands are easy to engage in. And so we continue to invest in the experience and elevate how we're engaging with our guests. And we're very bullish on the stores, the performance and the outlook.On UB Media, we're pleased with our advancements. We've invested in that this year. We've had hundreds of brands participate, thousands of campaigns over the course of the year. We've expanded our team. And it's exactly what you said, the power of our data, the unique insights that we can bring, because we have 42 million members, and we have an assortment that spans all price points in all categories and all geographies and demographics, we've got a really powerful tool with our brands, we can bring value to our brands through that.And so I'd say we continue to see good results from that. And -- but I'd also say we're just getting started with a lot of opportunity, more to come as we look into the future. So we're putting -- we're accelerating that effort as well."", 'Oliver Chen', ""Okay, David. Last on AI. You have QM Scientific and creative deals you've done, and you've also been active in augmented reality. Are there any highlights about how you see AI impacting the pre- and post-shopping experience and/or how you're utilizing it across the organization?"", 'David C. Kimbell', ""Yes. You're sneaking another question in, Oliver. On Scott's announcement day, too, right? So -- but yes, AI is an important part of our business. You mentioned QM Scientific, which we bought a few years ago, really is one step among many to increase the power of advanced analytics to more personalize our guest experience.And I'd say across the board, we're bringing that to life, more opportunity to go for sure, but with an ultimate objective of being able to better anticipate and understand our guest needs and desires and behaviors so we can better service them in store, online and through all of our touch points.And then we're using generative AI, we're really just getting started, but we see opportunities within Gen AI to streamline, accelerate and advance some of the experiences, things like our product descriptions, to automate some of that to make it more real time to speed up our innovation to leverage some of our creative processes. And behind the scenes with some data management and supply chain and other places. So we're excited about both what it's contributed so far, and it's a big focus for our organization to take full advantage and be a leader in that space as well."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Krisztina Katai with Deutsche Bank.', 'Krisztina Katai', ""I'll add my congratulations to both Scott and Paula. But my question is to you, Dave. I was wondering if you could talk about member engagement. You said that diamond and platinum members increased 20%. So what are you seeing with some of these newer members versus your more mature cohorts?And what are some of the early reads that you can share from a personalization effort perspective, how those are helping the maturation of wallet share or member spending that essentially gives you confidence that you can continue to deliver on your compound goal?"", 'David C. Kimbell', ""Yes. Great question, Krisztina, because our loyalty program is so key to our business and to our success. And I tell you, I can't -- couldn't be more pleased and proud of the team's efforts to evolve and advance this program. And what I say internally to our 53,000 associates is, every single one of us own and contribute to loyalty, both the acquisition of new members, but importantly, the engagement and delighting our members every single day, in-store, online and our guest services through our assortment, our advertising, our social media, every touch point we have. And so it is an always-on activity for us, it's top of mind every day for us to make sure that we are delighting our guests because we know that's the secret to our success and our long-term future.The debt -- big picture result of 8% growth of our loyalty program is evidence that that's working because the things that come together to drive that type of growth on a big number, a big number to start with is, first and foremost, retention we wouldn't be growing it if we weren't retaining at a very high, very healthy, we believe, industry-leading level, and we continue to work to improve that every day with every member through our personalization.So the personalization efforts, I'd say, first and foremost, are ultimately about retention because if I can use personalization to provide more value to our guests, then they will be more likely to stay with us, to buy more with us and to be a long-term guest and move up into the platinum and diamond levels and all of that.We also saw nice results in new member, who never been a member of Ulta Beauty, and we continue to expand that, and that's through our new stores, our advertising, our partnership with Target, our digital presence, our social media. And we feel like, while we've had a lot of scale, there are tens of millions of beauty enthusiasts that are not currently part of our program.And the third area is reactivation, where while we have very strong healthy retention, we don't retain everybody. So there is a pool of guests that -- most of the time, it isn't because they had a bad experience. It just fell out of the habit of shopping at Ulta. And so we have a very personalized direct program to reengage and reactivate those lost guests, and that's been contributing to our growth.So across the board, we're pleased with the engagement. We're pleased with the spend per member, all metrics in that program continue to be encouraging to us, and we see a long runway, and we're focused on it every day through innovation, hard work and just a commitment to guest experience to drive that for the long term."", 'Kiley F. Rawlins', 'Operator, I think we have time for one more question.', 'Operator', 'Sure. Our last question comes from the line of Michael Lasser with UBS.', 'Michael Lasser', ""Best wishes to Scott and Paula. My question is, how long are you willing to absorb market share losses in the prestige beauty category before responding with an increase in promotional activity, and if we assume that those market share losses extend into 2024, how is that going to impact Ulta Beauty's ability to achieve its earnings algorithm next year?"", 'David C. Kimbell', ""Yes, Michael, I'd say that, first, I'd start by answering that question is, yes, our goal and our long-term history is to gain share and our entire strategy across our assortment, our marketing, the loyalty program, our stores, our e-com, our digital tools, everything we do is designed to be a leader and to gain share and to drive our business forward. And in many parts of our business, we have been and continue to be doing that.Our prestige makeup and hair business have been more challenged. And that's really a reflection of expanded points of distribution, which I talked about hundreds points of distribution in largely in those that are impacting disproportionately those categories and some other competitive pressures.In mass, makeup, in mass skincare, in mass haircare, in prestige skincare, prestige fragrance, we are gaining share and have continued to do so. So our focus is to continue to do that, to take the healthy, strong share growing parts of our business and accelerate that, and to return the ones that have been a bit more challenged to growth, and we have got plans to do that. I talked about makeup on an earlier question. And we go through the newness that we've launched and more to come as we turn the calendar to 2024, the execution that we have in store, our focus online, we're confident that we will be able to drive that back. Same holds true in haircare. Specifically around promo, honestly, we see it trickle as a balance. Where we feel good about our overall position, our overall growth. As I said, we're gaining share in many parts of our business. And so we're pinpointed in how we want to leverage our promotional intensity. We don't want to wildly swing back when we have confidence that it's not just promo that will return to share growth, it's the collective strategies and actions, the long-term efforts around assortment and execution that will drive share growth over time.And so we'll leverage promo in the short term. We have been, but as we've said earlier, we in no way have turned back to 2019, which is one indicator. We're not just going to swing wildly. We'll be thoughtful, strategic, and have clear actions and long-term actions that get us to sustain share growth. And I say that from a position of confidence given our track record of gaining share consistently for many years, and we're confident we'll be able to do that well into the future.All right. So thank you for that question, Michael, and thanks for all of you for your engagement. I want to close by thanking our more than 53,000 Ulta Beauty associates for delivering another strong quarter for our shareholders while also successfully executing against our strategic priority.And once again, I want to thank Scott for his partnership and tremendous impact on Ulta Beauty, and I want to congratulate Paula as I know she is going to be an outstanding CFO for our company.We wish you all a happy and healthy holiday season. I hope you get out and shop at Ulta Beauty often. And we look forward to speaking to you again when we report results for fiscal 2023 on March 14. Hope you have a good evening."", 'Operator', ""And this concludes today's conference, and you may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.""]"

This SWOT analysis delves into the company's financials, revealing a 6.4% increase in net sales to $2.5 billion for the 13 weeks ended October 28, 2023, compared to the same period in the previous year. Gross profit also saw a rise, contributing to a robust financial overview. With a strategic focus on expanding its omnichannel presence and leveraging its partnership with Target, ULTA is poised to further cement its market dominance. However, the beauty industry's competitive landscape and economic fluctuations present ongoing challenges and opportunities for the company."", ""Brand Power and Market Presence: Ulta Beauty Inc (NASDAQ:ULTA) has established itself as a dominant force in the beauty retail sector. With a comprehensive range of products, including makeup, fragrances, skin care, and hair care, the company caters to a broad consumer base. Its strong brand recognition is bolstered by a loyalty program that provides valuable customer insights, driving repeat business and fostering a community of beauty enthusiasts. The partnership with Target further extends ULTA's reach, allowing it to tap into a wider demographic and benefit from increased foot traffic and visibility."", ""Financial Resilience and Growth: ULTA's financial performance is a testament to its operational efficiency and strategic initiatives. The recent 10-Q filing shows a significant increase in net sales and a solid gross profit margin. This financial resilience, coupled with a healthy balance sheet, positions ULTA to invest in growth opportunities and navigate market uncertainties effectively. The company's ability to generate substantial cash from operations and secure competitive financing provides the flexibility needed to sustain and expand its business model."", 'Inventory Management Challenges: As ULTA continues to expand its product offerings and store count, managing inventory levels becomes increasingly complex. The 10-Q filing indicates a notable increase in merchandise inventories, which could lead to excess stock and associated carrying costs if not managed effectively. This challenge requires sophisticated forecasting and inventory management systems to ensure product availability aligns with consumer demand and seasonal trends.', ""Dependence on Consumer Discretionary Spending: ULTA's performance is closely tied to consumer discretionary spending, which can be volatile and influenced by broader economic conditions.

This dependence necessitates a proactive approach to marketing and customer engagement to maintain sales momentum during economic fluctuations."", 'Digital and Omnichannel Expansion: The evolving retail landscape presents ULTA with opportunities to enhance its digital presence and omnichannel capabilities.

ULTA faces competition from both specialty retailers and large-scale department stores, which can lead to price wars and margin compression. Additionally, market saturation poses a risk to growth, as the company must find ways to stand out and attract customers in an increasingly crowded space.', ""Economic Sensitivity and Regulatory Changes: ULTA's performance is subject to economic cycles and consumer confidence levels. Economic downturns can lead to decreased discretionary spending, directly impacting sales.

Part of the popularity of the beloved golden tipple comes from the sheer amount of tradition that it has behind it. Making whiskey is an age-old craft, and one that goes back many centuries. Its origin began over a millennium ago, when distillation migrated from mainland Europe into Ireland and Scotland via traveling monks. The Scottish and Irish monasteries, lacking the vineyards and grapes of the continent, turned to fermenting grain mash, resulting in the first distillation of the modern whiskey.\xa0"", 'Whiskey is one of the Most Consumed Alcohols in the World, with the global whiskey market valued at $64 billion in 2022 and expected to reach $91.3 billion by 2028, with a CAGR of 6% during the forecast period.\xa0', 'The consumption of alcohol is shifting away from beer and wine and millennials are more likely to experiment with other alcoholic beverages, resulting in the growth of a ‘cocktail culture’. As a result, the use of whiskey as a premium ingredient has increased. Product innovations, such as flavored whiskeys, and organic and sustainable options are also some of the major factors propelling the market.\xa0', '2022 was also a great year for Scotch whisky, and exports of Scotland’s native spirit hit $7.5 billion last year, the highest figures ever. Exports by volume rose substantially as well, with the number of 700 ml bottles shipped overseas up by 21%, to 1.67 billion.', 'Similarly, as we mentioned in our article – 25 Best Bourbon Whiskeys Under $50 – Bourbon is a $9 billion signature industry in Kentucky that generates more than 22,500 jobs. And if we’re looking at production and consumption, the state receives more than $286 million in tax revenue each year from its iconic whiskey.\xa0', 'The positive economic impact of the popular golden liquor is something we seldom consider when having a drink, but, given the facts, maybe it’s time we all raise a glass to it.', 'The flavored whiskey market has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by the increasing consumer demand for unique and innovative alcoholic beverages. Flavored whiskey refers to whiskey that has been blended or infused with various flavors, such as fruits, spices, herbs etc. to enhance its taste and appeal to a wide range of consumers.\xa0', 'More than 16 million cases of flavored whiskey were sold in the U.S. in 2020, compared to less than 2 million ten years ago.

The brand’s fire-flavored and apple-flavored blends are some of the most popular flavored whiskeys in America.', 'Ready-to-drink beverages continue to make headlines as the fastest-growing alcohol beverage category. While malt-based RTDs still retain a 91% share by volume in the American RTD market, spirit-based RTDs grew by 51% in 2021, approximately double the growth of the wine-and malt-based categories. As we mentioned in our article – 25 Most Popular Spirits in the World –\xa0 the spirits-based RTDs are expected to grow at a CAGR of 33% in volume in the U.S. by 2025.\xa0', 'A recent new spirit-based RTD offering that popped up in the market is the good ol’ Jack & Coke.

Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) took a test-and learn-approach for the initial launch, applying lessons from a single-country rollout in Mexico to a global scaling strategy, bringing the product to 13 countries in 12 months.\xa0', 'Both the Brown-Forman Corporation (NYSE:BF-B) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO) rank among the Largest Beverage Companies in the World in 2023.\xa0', 'With that said, here are the Largest Whiskey Brands in America.\xa0', 'Brent Hofacker/Shutterstock.com', 'To collect data for this article, we have referred to sources such as Liquor, VinePair, Forbes, Reddit etc., looking for the Most Popular Whiskey Brands in America.

He believed that blending different malts would produce a greater whisky than the sum of its parts.

Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, is operating income adjusted for depreciation, depletion, amortization, basis of real estate sold and special items. Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered in isolation from, and is not intended to represent an alternative to, our GAAP results. We have not provided a reconciliation of this forward-looking non-GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure of net income because Adjusted EBITDA, as we define it, excludes the impact of certain items listed above in our definition of Adjusted EBITDA, and management cannot estimate these items or the impact they will have on Adjusted EBITDA on a forward-looking basis without unreasonable effort. As a result, investors may be unable to accurately compare the expected impact of the acquisition to our historical results or the results or expected results of other companies that may have treated such matters differently. Nonetheless, management believes that providing this forward-looking non-GAAP information about the acquisition is useful to investors, and given the uncertain nature of forward-looking statements, we believe investors are able to take into account the inherent limitations of this forward-looking non-GAAP information. We cannot predict the occurrence, timing or amount of any of the items that we exclude from our Adjusted EBITDA estimate.

Forward-looking statements are based on our current expectations and assumptions and are not guarantees of future events or performance. The realization of our expectations and the accuracy of our assumptions are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those identified in our 2022 Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as those set forth from time to time in our other public statements, reports, registration statements, prospectuses, information statements and other filings with the SEC.

It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. Importantly, General Electric Company (NYSE:GE) does carry debt. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky."", ""Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more common (but still painful) scenario is that it has to raise new equity capital at a low price, thus permanently diluting shareholders. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together."", ' Check out our latest analysis for General Electric ', 'As you can see below, General Electric had US$20.8b of debt at September 2023, down from US$30.4b a year prior. However, it does have US$18.1b in cash offsetting this, leading to net debt of about US$2.74b.', 'According to the last reported balance sheet, General Electric had liabilities of US$48.2b due within 12 months, and liabilities of US$78.7b due beyond 12 months. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$18.1b as well as receivables valued at US$16.1b due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$92.7b.', 'This is a mountain of leverage even relative to its gargantuan market capitalization of US$129.4b. Should its lenders demand that it shore up the balance sheet, shareholders would likely face severe dilution.', 'We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).', ""General Electric has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.23. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 16.0 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. Better yet, General Electric grew its EBIT by 436% last year, which is an impressive improvement. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine General Electric's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts."", ""Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So the logical step is to look at the proportion of that EBIT that is matched by actual free cash flow. During the last three years, General Electric generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 88% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so."", ""General Electric's interest cover suggests it can handle its debt as easily as Cristiano Ronaldo could score a goal against an under 14's goalkeeper. But truth be told we feel its level of total liabilities does undermine this impression a bit. Looking at the bigger picture, we think General Electric's use of debt seems quite reasonable and we're not concerned about it. While debt does bring risk, when used wisely it can also bring a higher return on equity. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. Case in point: We've spotted   3 warning signs for General Electric  you should be aware of, and 1 of them is significant."", ""If you're interested in investing in businesses that can grow profits without the burden of debt, then check out this free list of growing businesses that have net cash on the balance sheet."", 'Have feedback on this article?

UnitedHealth forecast a 2024 MLR of 84%, a full percentage point higher than analysts’ consensus expectation.', 'Despite the MA headwind, UnitedHealthcare’s financial targets overall still came in in-line or ahead of analyst expectations.', 'UnitedHealth is a behemoth in the U.S. healthcare industry, with one of the largest pharmacy benefits managers, an expanding healthcare IT arm and a growing presence in care delivery, including a network of tens of thousands of physicians.', 'UnitedHealth is also the dominant health insurer in many markets, including in MA. The Minnesota-based company is the largest provider of the privately-run Medicare plans.', 'Management has said they expect their share of the market to grow as more seniors age into the government insurance program and select MA over traditional Medicare.', 'However, UnitedHealth is now saying that MA growth could be depressed next year thanks to a rate notice from the CMS that’s deeply unpopular with insurers.', 'Earlier this year, the CMS finalized MA rates for 2024 that regulators said should result in a 3.3% increase in revenue for health insurers in the program. The changes also include a new approach to risk adjustment meant to curb upcoding, a practice where insurers inflate their members’ sicknesses to get higher payments from the government.', 'However, insurers have said the changes, which are being phased in over the next three years, will result in a net decrease to MA revenue overall.', '“That rate notice has a material impact in terms of revenues associated with our Medicare Advantage portfolio, and as you can see that ripples through the metrics of the organization,” CEO Andrew Witty said during UnitedHealth’s investor day.', 'UnitedHealthcare, UnitedHealth’s health insurance division, now expects slower Medicare revenue and membership growth next year than analysts expected.', 'UnitedHealth expects to add between 325,000 and 375,000 Medicare Advantage members next year, representing almost 4% growth at the midpoint — “well below our model,” commented JP Morgan analyst Lisa Gill in a note.', 'That’s compared to 11% membership growth year to date in 2023, according to CMS data cited in a TD Cowen note. Previously, UnitedHealth leadership said they expected to grow above the overall MA industry growth rate in 2024, so “this appears to be a disappointment,” TD Cowen analyst Gary Taylor wrote.', 'However, “we are not materially surprised to see the slower growth rate in 2024 given the changes with the risk adjustment,” Gill said.', 'Some payers have said the rate changes could force them to cut benefits in MA. Yet, UnitedHealth has spent the last six months reconfiguring its plans in response to the rate notice, looking for ways to contain costs without curtailing benefits, Witty said.', 'UnitedHealthcare should bring in about $303 billion in revenue next year, mostly driven by Medicaid upside, the company said. TD Cowen’s Taylor noted he was unsure why UnitedHealth forecast the Medicaid improvement, given Medicaid payers are shedding members as states recheck eligibility for the safety-net insurance coming out of the COVID-19 pandemic.', 'UnitedHealth thinks its Medicaid enrollment will drop by up to 200,000 members next year due to redeterminations, the company said.', 'UnitedHealth leadership devoted half of their investor day to talking about the insurer’s plans to expand value-based care arrangements — a “core objective” for the next several years, Witty said.', 'A key actor in striving for that objective is Optum Health, UnitedHealth’s care delivery network that’s under the umbrella of its health services business Optum.', 'Optum released stronger 2024 guidance than analysts expected. Much of that growth is due to better-than-expected margins for Optum Health, analysts said.', 'Optum Health has been working to transition commercial lives into more lucrative value-based arrangements, management said in comments earlier this year.', 'Currently, Optum Health has about 4 million lives in fully accountable payment arrangements — a number that’s nearly doubled from 2021, said UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson during the investor day.', 'Optum Health expects to add another 750,000 lives by the end of next year.', '”You should expect us to grow that number substantially each year,” Thompson said. “Our long-term ambition is to transition as many people as possible into value-based care.”', 'Overall, UnitedHealth expects 2024 adjusted profit of $27.50 to $28 a share, largely in line with what analysts expected.', 'Expected revenue is $400 billion to $403 billion, higher than Wall Street consensus.', 'This story was originally published on Healthcare Dive.

We are particularly impressed by the considerable earnings growth posted by the company, which was likely backed by its high ROE.

On one hand, insiders may sell shares for various personal reasons that do not necessarily reflect their outlook on the company's future. On the other hand, a pattern of insider selling could signal that those with the most intimate knowledge of the company's workings believe the stock may be overvalued or that growth prospects are not as strong as the market perceives."", ""In the case of Jeffrey Berkes's recent sale of 4,870 shares, it is important to consider the broader context of insider activity at Federal Realty Investment Trust. Over the past year, there have been no insider purchases reported, while there have been three instances of insider selling. This trend could suggest a cautious or bearish sentiment among insiders regarding the company's valuation or future performance."", ""When examining the relationship between insider selling and the stock price of Federal Realty Investment Trust, it's crucial to analyze the company's current valuation metrics. With a price-earnings ratio of 27.79, Federal Realty is trading above the industry median of 17.47. This indicates that the stock may be priced more richly compared to its peers. However, it is trading below its historical median price-earnings ratio, which could suggest some level of undervaluation."", ""On the day of the insider's recent sale, shares of Federal Realty Investment Trust were trading at $94.86, giving the company a market cap of $7.802 billion.

This valuation is based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor, and future business performance estimates. With a price-to-GF-Value ratio of 0.93, the stock is considered to be Fairly Valued. This suggests that the market has efficiently priced the stock relative to its estimated intrinsic value.', ""However, the insider's decision to sell shares could be interpreted as a lack of confidence in the stock's ability to outperform or maintain its current valuation. Investors should consider whether this insider sale is a signal to reevaluate their investment thesis for Federal Realty Investment Trust, especially in light of the broader insider selling trend over the past year."", ""Jeffrey Berkes's sale of 4,870 shares of Federal Realty Investment Trust is a significant event that warrants attention. While the company's stock appears to be fairly valued according to the GF Value, the pattern of insider selling raises questions about the insiders' confidence in the stock's future performance. Investors should weigh the insider transactions alongside other financial metrics and market analyses to make informed decisions about their investment in Federal Realty Investment Trust."", ""As always, it is recommended that investors conduct their own due diligence and consider the broader market conditions, the company's financial health, and their investment strategy before making any investment decisions based on insider activity."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of The Sherwin-Williams Company (NYSE:SHW)."", 'ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' Check out our latest analysis for Sherwin-Williams ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Sherwin-Williams is:', '64% = US$2.4b ÷ US$3.8b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).', ""The 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.64 in profit."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Sherwin-Williams has a better ROE than the average (13%) in the Chemicals industry."", ""That is a good sign. Bear in mind, a high ROE doesn't always mean superior financial performance. A higher proportion of debt in a company's capital structure may also result in a high ROE, where the high debt levels could be a huge risk ."", 'Companies usually need to invest money to grow their profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the use of debt will improve the returns, but will not change the equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.', 'Sherwin-Williams clearly uses a high amount of debt to boost returns, as it has a debt to equity ratio of 2.63. While no doubt that its ROE is impressive, we would have been even more impressed had the company achieved this with lower debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time.', ""Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", ""Having said that, while ROE is a useful indicator of business quality, you'll have to look at a whole range of factors to determine the right price to buy a stock. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider.

Further, DGX continues to hold growth momentum in the cardiometabolic, endocrinology, infectious disease and carrier and prenatal genetic screening services."", 'Volume Rebound in the Base Business: Quest Diagnostics’ collaborations with health plans, hospitals and physicians have elevated the demand for services, which shows continued return to care. In the third quarter, the company successfully completed negotiations for all strategic health plan renewals scheduled for 2023, positioning it to build on growth opportunities.', 'Across Physician Lab Services, a large number of strategic partnerships with health plans involve value-based arrangements, which are leading to faster growth and share gains than traditional relationships. Within Hospital labs, progress in terms of partnerships with Northern Light Health, Lee Health and Tower Health is particularly encouraging in the Professional Lab Services (“PLS”) business. In Consumer Health, the company generated solid base business revenue growth from the consumer-initiated testing channel in the third quarter.', 'A Strategic Imperative to Drive Operational Excellence: In terms of driving operational excellence, the company focuses on improving its operational quality, service and costs, thereby driving productivity gains.', 'The Invigorate initiative, which consists of several flagship programs with individually structured plans, was designed to reduce its cost structure and improve performance. Quest Diagnostics is committed to achieving its savings and productivity improvements of approximately 3% annually via this initiative.', 'Earlier in 2023, the company implemented an automated microbiology solution in Lenexa, KS, with Lewisville, TX, being the next in line. Post completion, Quest’s four major laboratories will use automated microbiology lines with artificial intelligence embedded, identifying positive and negative cases leading to improved quality and productivity.

The current portion of the debt also stood much higher at $304 million. A higher debt level induces higher interest payments, which come with the risk of failure to pay the same. The times interest earned for the company stands at 8%, a sequential drop from 8.7% at the end of the second quarter.', 'Competitive Landscape: Quest Diagnostics faces intense competition, primarily from LabCorp, other commercial laboratories and hospitals. While pricing is an important factor in choosing a testing lab, hospital-affiliated physicians expect a high level of service, including the accurate and rapid turnaround of testing results. As a result, Quest Diagnostics and other commercial labs compete with hospital-affiliated labs, primarily based on the quality of service.', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Quest Diagnostics’ 2023 earnings per share (EPS) has moved up from $8.69 to $8.71 in the past 30 days.', 'The consensus estimate for the company’s 2023 revenues is pegged at $9.21 billion.

There's a couple of lessons learned. So I went through this experience prior at Express. So I would say that turning that brought with me some good lessons. The number one lesson that I brought with me was patience and timing. And to think that you can do it all at once, you're going to burn out your team. And they're just-- they're not even going to be here to do it for you. So that was a big important lesson for me. So I feel like when I got to Abercrombie, I just knew I had to pace it differently."", ""I think building the team is also incredibly important because we had a lot of long-term associates. Many of whom are still with us. And we have new thinking.

But if you wait until you think everything is perfect and ready to go, you're never-- you're going to stand still. You're not going to get anywhere. But I will tell you, the company was at quite an inflection point. And between the business, the profitability, and all the things that were swirling around, I mean, the first two years were extraordinarily challenging."", 'BRIAN SOZZI: Fran, looking back, what would you tell your former self?', ""FRAN HOROWITZ: You know, I think what's very important as you go through your career is to learn how to advocate for yourself. And that is-- it's not an easy thing to do because you have to balance between being humble and being proud of what you've accomplished.
