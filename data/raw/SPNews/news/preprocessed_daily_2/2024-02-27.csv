You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer cyclical sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Invest In.\xa0', 'Consumer cyclical companies produce goods and services that are considered non-essential or discretionary, meaning consumers are more likely to purchase them when they have extra income or feel confident about their financial situation. Consumer cyclical stocks include companies in sectors such as retail, automotive, travel and leisure, entertainment, and luxury goods.', ""Over the past year, we've seen clear evidence that consumers have remained strong despite challenges like high inflation, increasing interest rates, and greater recession concerns. This resilience notably buoyed the performance of stocks within the consumer discretionary sector, which includes businesses offering non-essential products and services such as apparel, automobiles, and accommodations. The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index ended 2023 with a total return of 42.41%, reporting one of its best years on record. In addition to the support from a strong consumer base, the stocks in this sector also gained from broader market trends that propelled the overall stock market higher in 2023. These trends included relief as the Federal Reserve signaled the potential end of its rate-hiking cycle as the year progressed. Furthermore, sector-level performance was boosted by specific issues affecting some of the largest companies within it. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), the two largest companies in the sector by a significant margin, have both seen remarkable gains in the past year, driven by the surge in mega-cap, tech-related stocks. Additionally, both companies are considered potential investment opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence."", ""After experiencing robust performance in 2023, analysts are also showing a preference for the sector in the current year. Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, stated that consumers' willingness to sustain moderate spending growth has been crucial for the economy. He suggested that this could be attributed, at least in part, to the robust labor market and notable wage increases. Based on a Fidelity report, the performance of sectors is expected to be influenced by broader economic factors in 2024. If inflation remains low and the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates, it could be advantageous for the sector, as consumers may be more inclined to buy expensive items like cars or homes. An even more positive scenario would be if the economy avoids a recession and job markets stay robust, which would particularly benefit this sector."", ""The report highlighted that following the sector's strong performance in 2023, stock valuations are not as low as they were previously. However, there are still segments of the market where the firm has identified robust long-term growth prospects, and where stocks are trading at attractive prices. One ongoing area of opportunity includes certain retailers. These companies possess defensive characteristics within their business models, offering some protection in case of a deteriorating economic outlook."", 'Another factor contributing to the positive outlook for the sector is that certain companies within it opt to distribute dividends when they maintain a steady cash flow and have a track record of sharing profits with shareholders.

EHTH is set to report its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb 27, before the opening bell. It is expected to have witnessed increased Medicare Advantage members and commission revenues in the December quarter.', 'eHealth’s earnings beat the consensus estimate in one of the prior four quarters and missed on the other three occasions, with the average surprise being negative 1.1%. This is depicted in the graph below:', 'eHealth, Inc. price-eps-surprise | eHealth, Inc. Quote', 'In the last reported quarter, the leading online health insurance marketplace reported an adjusted operating loss per share of $1.54, wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a loss of 70 cents due to higher operating costs and lower enrollment volume in the Individual, Family, and Small Business segment. The negatives were partially offset by favorable member retention and better-than-expected cash collections.', 'Now, let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the fourth-quarter earnings announcement.', 'eHealth’s fourth quarter results are expected to benefit from higher Medicare Part D and Small Business commission revenues. As such, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter total commission revenues is pegged at almost $210 million, signaling 23.1% year-over-year growth.', 'The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter other revenues indicates a 36% increase from the year-ago period. The consensus mark for fourth-quarter overall Individual, Family and Small Business segment revenues hints at a 30% jump from the year-ago quarter.', 'These are likely to have positioned the company for top-line growth in the fourth quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total revenues is pegged at $244.4 million, indicating a 24.5% increase from the year-ago level.', 'The Individual, Family and Small Business segment is expected to have continued witnessing growth in profits in the fourth quarter. Also, in its preliminary results, EHTH said that its Medicare witnessed enrollment growth in the to-be-reported quarter. The segment’s gross margin is expected to have increased, boosting profit levels.', 'The company estimates Medicare Advantage members to have jumped 22% year over year in the fourth quarter. It also anticipates Total Medicare approved members to have risen 16% year over year. eHealth’s fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to be within $65-$70 million, up from the year-ago level of $49.5 million, on the back of its transformation initiatives.', 'The factors stated above are likely to have led to year-over-year growth in profits. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings per share of $1.94 suggests a 70.2% increase from the prior-year level of $1.14. The estimate remained stable over the past week.', 'However, the company is expected to have encountered higher operating costs and expenses due to continued growth in customer care and enrollment costs, as well as general and administrative expenses. This is likely to have affected EHTH’s profit growth levels, making an earnings beat uncertain. For full year 2023, the company expects operating cash outflow to be $7 million.', 'Our proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for eHealth this time around. The combination of a positive\xa0Earnings ESP\xa0and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.', 'Earnings ESP: The company currently has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.

However, improving profit levels in the Japan segment partially offset the negatives.', 'Unum Group’s fourth-quarter 2023 operating net income of $1.79 per share missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.8% due to higher policy benefits, commissions, interest and debt expenses and weaker performance in Unum International and Colonial Life. The negatives were partly offset by strong operations in the Unum U.S. unit.', 'Lincoln National reported fourth-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $1.45 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.9% on the back of solid contributions from the Group Protection business, a strong fixed annuity business and positive flows in the Retirement Plan Services unit.

Nevertheless, we are always paying attention to the latest value, growth, and momentum trends to underscore strong picks.', 'Of these, value investing is easily one of the most popular ways to find great stocks in any market environment. Value investors rely on traditional forms of analysis on key valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are undervalued, leaving room for profits.', 'On top of the Zacks Rank, investors can also look at our innovative Style Scores system to find stocks with specific traits. For example, value investors will want to focus on the ""Value"" category. Stocks with high Zacks Ranks and ""A"" grades for Value will be some of the highest-quality value stocks on the market today.', ""One stock to keep an eye on is Unum Group (UNM). UNM is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock is trading with P/E ratio of 6 right now. For comparison, its industry sports an average P/E of 10.57. UNM's Forward P/E has been as high as 7.02 and as low as 5.33, with a median of 6.04, all within the past year."", ""We also note that UNM holds a PEG ratio of 0.75. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. UNM's PEG compares to its industry's average PEG of 1.64. Over the last 12 months, UNM's PEG has been as high as 1.03 and as low as 0.63, with a median of 0.79."", ""Another notable valuation metric for UNM is its P/B ratio of 1. The P/B ratio pits a stock's market value against its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. This stock's P/B looks attractive against its industry's average P/B of 1.67. Over the past year, UNM's P/B has been as high as 1.07 and as low as 0.79, with a median of 0.96."", ""Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. This is a prefered metric because revenue can't really be manipulated, so sales are often a truer performance indicator. UNM has a P/S ratio of 0.77. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 1.13."", ""Finally, investors should note that UNM has a P/CF ratio of 6.69. This data point considers a firm's operating cash flow and is frequently used to find companies that are undervalued when considering their solid cash outlook.

Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.', 'Do you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five ""Strong Buy"" recommendations for every ""Strong Sell"" recommendation.', ""This means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements."", ""With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision."", 'Zacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR', 'In spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.', 'The ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.', 'Analysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.', 'On the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.', 'In addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.', 'There is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.', 'Is UNM a Good Investment?', 'Looking at the earnings estimate revisions for Unum, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 4.2% over the past month to $8.19.', ""Analysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term."", ""The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Unum.

It is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. General Motors Company GM, Adtalem Global Education Inc. ATGE, Unum Group UNM and KB Home KBH boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:General Motors, which designs, builds, and sells cars, trucks, crossovers, and automobile parts globally, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks in the S&P 500 and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks To Invest In 2024.\xa0', 'In 2023, despite the presence of higher interest rates, consumers remained unfazed, and investors displayed more optimism than apprehension, largely fueled by the excitement surrounding advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Consequently, the S&P 500 experienced a remarkable surge, gaining over 24% last year. This surge was primarily attributed to the dominance of what has been dubbed the ""Magnificent Seven."" These seven major companies, which include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), played a pivotal role in driving the S&P 500\'s performance, contributing significantly to its overall returns. On the flip side, a staggering 72% of stocks failed to match the performance of the S&P 500 index, setting a new record for underperformance. Additionally, dividend-paying stocks experienced a downturn in 2023, paving the way for the dominance of technology equities. Despite this, the stock market returns throughout the year were both exceptional and notably robust in comparison to historical trends.', 'Despite their recent lackluster performance, dividends remain a crucial aspect of returns for equity investors and have garnered considerable attention in capital markets research. The appeal of dividend-paying stocks is substantial, and rightfully so as they have the potential to significantly enhance long-term investment outcomes. This general observation has been well-documented across various periods and global markets. For instance, one study analyzed the components contributing to total equity returns of U.S. stocks spanning from 1802 to 2002. It revealed that dividends, along with real growth in dividends, constituted a substantial portion, accounting for 5.8% of the total annualized return of 7.9% over 200 years. Another study, conducted from a global perspective by researchers at the London Business School, examined data from 1900 to 2005 across 17 countries. It found that the real return averaged around 5%, with an average dividend yield of 4.5% during that timeframe. These findings provide compelling evidence for the significance of dividends for long-term investors.', ""Yet another report from S&P Dow Jones Indices provided insight into the enduring impact of dividend-paying equities over the long term. This report emphasized that since 1926, dividends have played a significant role, contributing roughly 32% of the total return for the S&P 500, with capital appreciations making up the remaining 68%. Hence, both sustainable dividend income and the potential for capital appreciation are key considerations for forming expectations regarding total returns. Furthermore, the growth of dividends proves to be beneficial for investors.

According to research from the US National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), conducted over a span of nearly a decade, the growth of remote jobs varies significantly among English-speaking countries. The study, analyzing over 250 million job vacancies offering remote or hybrid work, highlights the pronounced rise of remote work in urban centers, particularly in cities like Washington, D.C., San Francisco, London, and Sydney. This trend is unsurprising, given the prevalence of white-collar jobs in these areas, which are more amenable to remote work arrangements.\xa0', ""Moreover, the research underscores the lasting impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on remote work adoption globally. While initial spikes were observed in countries with severe outbreaks, remote work has persisted as a popular choice beyond the pandemic's peak. Factors such as infrastructure and the prevalence of remote-capable industries significantly influence a city's remote work landscape. However, regional disparities persist, with southern cities in the U.S. exhibiting lower rates of remote job availability compared to their northeastern and western counterparts, owing to differences in industry composition and job demands."", 'In the quest for remote employment, the odds are increasingly stacked against applicants, particularly for lucrative positions.

While costs related to technological upgrades might impede bottom-line growth, these will eventually lead to improved operating efficiency.

These started as partnership firms focused on initial public offerings (IPOs), secondary equity offerings, brokerage and mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Gradually, the companies have evolved into providers of various other services, including securities research, proprietary trading and investment management.

Though the ride will be bumpy for investment banks in the near term, the improving operating backdrop will support industry’s players’ revenue growth.Trading Business Offers Some Support: Client activity in the trading business largely depends on the prevalent macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions. Since 2022, market volatility has significantly increased due to several geopolitical and macroeconomic headwinds. Though there has been some stability in the macroeconomic backdrop, markets continue to grapple with high global inflation, high interest rates and other geopolitical matters. So, trading volumes will likely remain decent, driven by solid client activities in equity and fixed-income businesses, thereby boosting industry players’ trading income.Technology to Improve Operating Efficiency: Innovative trading platforms, the use of artificial intelligence (AI) and investments in technology and advertising are likely to aid the operations of investment banks. The industry players are attracting and retaining the best talent for building a leadership team and spending heavily on technology to help clients with infrastructure development and new platforms.

See “Terminology” for the definitions of these and other non-GAAP financial measures. We utilize Adjusted Gross Margin, Net Yield, and Net Per Diem to manage our business on a day-to-day basis because they reflect revenue earned net of certain direct variable costs. We also utilize Net Cruise Cost and Adjusted Net Cruise Cost Excluding Fuel to manage our business on a day-to-day basis.

In order to monitor results excluding these fluctuations, we calculate certain non-GAAP measures on a Constant Currency basis, whereby current period revenue and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are converted to U.S. dollars using currency exchange rates of the comparable period.

We also believe that Adjusted EBITDA is a useful measure in determining our performance as it reflects certain operating drivers of our business, such as sales growth, operating costs, marketing, general and administrative expense and other operating income and expense. In addition, management uses Adjusted EBITDA as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. Adjusted EBITDA is not a defined term under GAAP nor is it intended to be a measure of liquidity or cash flows from operations or a measure comparable to net income (loss), as it does not take into account certain requirements such as capital expenditures and related depreciation, principal and interest payments and tax payments and it includes other supplemental adjustments.', 'In addition, Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that exclude certain amounts and are used to supplement GAAP net income (loss) and EPS. We use Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS as key performance measures of our earnings performance. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance and when planning, forecasting and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparison to our historical performance. In addition, management uses Adjusted EPS as a performance measure for our incentive compensation. The amounts excluded in the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures may vary from period to period; accordingly, our presentation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS may not be indicative of future adjustments or results. For example, for the year ended December 31, 2022, we incurred $12.1 million related to restructuring costs or charges. We included this as an adjustment in the reconciliation of Adjusted Net Income (Loss) since the expenses are not representative of our day-to-day operations; however, this adjustment did not occur and is not included in the comparative period presented within.', 'Net Leverage and Net Debt are performance measures that we believe provide management and investors a more complete understanding of our leverage position and borrowing capacity after factoring in cash and cash equivalents.', 'Management believes Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow provide investors with useful financial metrics to assess our ability to service and repay our debt and to pursue opportunities to enhance our growth after making the capital investments required to support ongoing business operations and long-term value creation. Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow do not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures as they exclude certain mandatory expenditures such as repayment of maturing debt. Management uses Free Cash Flow and Adjusted Free Cash Flow as measures to assess both business performance and overall liquidity.', 'You are encouraged to evaluate each adjustment used in calculating our non-GAAP financial measures and the reasons we consider our non-GAAP financial measures appropriate for supplemental analysis. In evaluating our non-GAAP financial measures, you should be aware that in the future we may incur expenses similar to the adjustments in our presentation. Our non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP.

You can skip our detailed analysis of ESG investing and its prospects, and go directly to read 5 Best Environmental Dividend Stocks To Invest In According To Analysts.\xa0', 'Sustainable investing, increasingly gaining traction among investors, represents a pivotal shift in financial markets towards aligning profit motives with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations. A growing number of individuals are becoming attracted to ESG investments for a variety of reasons, ranging from ethical concerns to sound financial decision-making. As per research conducted by deVere Group, over 800 clients revealed that more than half (56%) of investors expressed their intentions to boost their investments in ESG funds in 2024.', 'Despite the increasing popularity of ESG investing, the year 2023 did not fare well for such investment strategies. Investors persisted in withdrawing their investments from sustainable funds during the fourth quarter of 2023. U.S. sustainable funds experienced their initial year of outflows since records began over a decade ago, marking 2023 as their most challenging year to date, according to a report by Morningstar. In the fourth quarter alone, investors withdrew $5 billion from U.S. sustainable funds, contributing to a total outflow of $13 billion throughout the year. This trend was attributed to underperformance, ongoing political scrutiny in the US, and a challenging year for an iShares fund. Moreover, by the end of 2023, the total assets invested in sustainable funds reached $323 billion. This figure indicates a drop of approximately 12% from the previous record high recorded at the end of 2021. However, it also signifies an 18% increase from the lowest point observed in the third quarter of 2022. In contrast, assets within the broader U.S. funds market reached their peak at the end of 2021 but experienced a decline of 5% by the end of 2023.', 'That said, analysts are optimistic about the potential of ESG investing in the foreseeable future. Based on a study conducted by Bloomberg Intelligence, global ESG assets are projected to surpass $53 trillion by 2025, constituting more than a third of the estimated total assets under management of $140.5 trillion. The convergence of factors including the pandemic and the green recovery initiatives in major economies such as the U.S., EU, and China is expected to demonstrate the efficacy of ESG in evaluating a fresh array of financial risks and leveraging capital markets.', 'As discussed previously, there is a growing trend among investors towards ESG investing, primarily due to the reputation of these assets for delivering consistent returns. Contrary to concerns regarding potential conflicts between financial gains and ESG principles, a survey conducted by PwC revealed that nine out of ten asset managers believe that incorporating ESG criteria into their investment approach will enhance overall returns. Moreover, a majority of institutional investors, accounting for 60%, reported experiencing higher performance yields from ESG investments compared to non-ESG alternatives. The survey also noted that investors are willing to pay for ESG performance, as they anticipate the potential for higher returns. Specifically, three-quarters of those surveyed, constituting 78%, expressed their readiness to pay elevated fees for ESG funds.', 'American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), AT&T Inc.

In fact, it has evolved into the second-largest enterprise software company in the world.', 'Innovation has been instrumental to that success. Salesforce was among the first companies to deliver its software from the cloud, and regular product development has kept it on the cutting edge of CRM technology.

Those efforts could send the stock higher in the future.', ""Here's what investors should know."", 'Salesforce reported solid results for the third quarter of its fiscal 2024 as it continued to balance growth and profitability. For the period, which ended Oct. 31, revenue increased 11% to $8.7 billion on particularly strong momentum in the data cloud segment.

Salesforce also derives a small portion of revenue from professional services, including advisory and training services.', 'Salesforce is well positioned to grow its business. Its 22% market share in customer relationship management software exceeds that of the next four competitors combined, and analysts have praised its products in multiple industry verticals. In the past year, Gartner has recognized its leadership in sales force automation, multichannel marketing, digital commerce, customer engagement, and customer data software.', 'Moreover, research company G2 ranked Salesforce as the best software seller in any product category in 2024. That commendation was based on high customer satisfaction scores and a strong presence across several software markets.', 'Collectively, those accolades tell investors that Salesforce is doing something right. But they also tell prospective customers that it has software products worth considering.', 'Salesforce has a significant opportunity to drive growth through data analytics and artificial intelligence (AI) products. A survey from Morgan Stanley identified those categories as the two highest IT spending priorities in 2024. That survey also identified Salesforce as being the third most likely company to gain share in IT budgets, behind Microsoft and Amazon, this year.', 'Indeed, Salesforce reported strong demand for data analytics and integration tools in its fiscal third quarter, and momentum should accelerate as more businesses lean into AI. In fact, CEO Marc Benioff expects data cloud to become the core engine behind every Salesforce application. Businesses must have a data management strategy before they can build and deploy effective AI, and the Salesforce data cloud is a logical option simply because so many businesses already use its CRM software.', 'Additionally, Salesforce recently announced the general availability of Einstein Copilot, a generative AI assistant that automates workflows across its CRM applications. For instance, it can surface predictive sales insights, respond to customer service requests, create personalized marketing material, and aid in the development of digital storefronts. Einstein Copilot could produce a significant revenue stream as more businesses turn to AI to boost productivity and improve efficiency.', 'Finally, Salesforce also provides CRM products designed for specific industries such as consumer goods, healthcare, manufacturing, and retail. That strategy has been effective because it reduces friction for potential customers. For instance, nine of its 13 industry-specific CRM platforms grew revenue by more than 50% in its fiscal third quarter. Those beneficial effects should persist.', 'Wall Street expects Salesforce to grow its revenues at a 12% annualized rate over the next five years, but that estimate leaves room for upside surprises. The CRM market is forecast to expand at an annualized rate of 14% through 2030, which potentially puts Salesforce on a glide path to low-teens percentage revenue growth simply because it dominates the CRM industry.', ""However, it has an opportunity to gain share in IT budgets with newer products for data management and generative AI. That hints at a bull-case scenario defined by mid-teens percentage revenue growth through the end of the decade. In any case, its current valuation of 8.5 times sales looks reasonable in context, despite being a premium to the company's three-year average of 7.5 times sales."", ""The market seems to be sleeping on Salesforce, or else investors lack confidence in its ability to keep pace with the CRM market. In either case, that creates a buying opportunity. Salesforce will not triple over the next five years -- it's not a moonshot stock -- but it could certainly beat the market during that period.

Solid booking levels highlight the strength across FLS’ end markets. The company’s Diversify, Decarbonize and Digitize strategy also supports its strong booking levels. Flowserve’s fourth-quarter bookings of $1.04 billion marked the eighth consecutive quarter of more than $1 billion bookings.Increased revenues in the original equipment and aftermarket business are aiding both the Flowserve Pump Division (revenues up 12.6% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023) and Flow Control Division (revenues up 11.3% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023) segments.

Selling, general and administrative expenses also increased 17.9% in the same period due to higher broad-based annual incentive compensation.Flowserve’s international presence keeps the company exposed to the risk of adverse currency fluctuations.

Adjusted EBITDA of $195 million, or 21.8% of net sales, decreased 3% from $202 million, or 23.1% of net sales, in the prior year. The decrease in Adjusted EBITDA was primarily attributable to higher operating costs and lower volumes, partially offset by contributions from the Liquibox acquisition and favorable net price realization.', 'Fourth quarter net sales in Protective were $485 million, a decrease of 9% as reported. Net sales were favorably impacted by currency fluctuation of $4 million, or 1%. On a constant dollar basis, net sales decreased $51 million, or 10%.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Sealed Air is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for SEE in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 64 cents per share for SEE, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 62 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for SEE, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +3.46% heading into earnings season.', 'Sealed Air Corporation price-eps-surprise | Sealed Air Corporation Quote', 'A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that SEE has a Zacks Rank #3 and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Sealed Air, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.', 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The key themes of Buffett\'s letter were similar to what they are every year, and understandably so. Buffett does not believe in changing his investing strategies based on short-term market movements. Buffett said Berkshire\'s goal remains owning entire or parts of businesses which ""enjoy good economics that are fundamental and enduring.""', 'What caught the market\'s attention was Buffett\'s revelation that Berkshire\'s cash pile has soared to about $167.6 billion as of the end of 2023. But what was alarming in this figure was the reason why Buffett, who is always a fan of letting the money do the work, is not deploying this cash. Buffett said that there remain ""only a handful"" of companies that impress Berkshire in the US and outside the country there are ""essentially no candidates"" for capital deployment opportunities for Berkshire.', 'Buffett said to think that investors have gotten wiser over time would be a mistake. The billionaire said the constant availability of financial news and trading platforms have only made the investors ""active"" because of the ""casino-like"" behavior of the markets.', 'In his latest letter, Warren Buffett talked about how he likes to view ""market seizures"" as investing opportunities:', '""Occasionally, markets and/or the economy will cause stocks and bonds of some large and fundamentally good businesses to be strikingly mispriced. Indeed, markets can – and will – unpredictably seize up or even vanish as they did for four months in 1914 and for a few days in 2001. If you believe that American investors are now more stable than in the past, think back to September 2008. Speed of communication and the wonders of technology facilitate instant worldwide paralysis, and we have come a long way since smoke signals. Such instant panics won’t happen often – but they will happen. Berkshire’s ability to immediately respond to market seizures with both huge sums and certainty of performance may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity. Though the stock market is massively larger than it was in our early years, today’s active participants are neither more emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school. For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young. The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants.""', 'Methodology', ""For this article we scanned Warren Buffett's Q4'2023 portfolio and chose his top 12 stock picks.

Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the clean energy industry, head directly to 5 Best Green Stocks To Invest In 2024.', 'In 2023, the solar energy market saw positive growth, while the wind energy sector faced significant challenges. Wind energy projects struggled with rising costs for materials, labor, and capital, as well as delays in interconnection, permits, and transmission. However, there was some relief in the supply chain as new clean energy and climate laws came into effect. Federal investments in clean energy and increasing demand for decarbonization from both public and private sectors are driving forces for renewables. These factors are expected to help renewables overcome obstacles in 2024 to meet climate targets, as per Deloitte. 2024 is expected to see varying speeds of growth across renewable technologies, industries, and markets. The Energy Information Administration predicts a 17% growth in renewable deployment, reaching 42 gigawatts in 2024, which would account for nearly a quarter of electricity generation.', 'According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, investments in clean energy technology are projected to reach nearly $800 billion in 2024, a 10% to 20% increase from 2023. Solar energy is expected to receive the largest share of this investment, accounting for around 55% of the total. Onshore wind will see significant investment as well, although at a slower growth rate. The fastest-growing sectors are anticipated to be battery energy storage and electrolysis.\xa0', 'Despite increasing costs for offshore wind and hydrogen energy, decreasing raw material prices are likely to lead to a continued decline in the average cost of clean energy technologies in 2024. Solar and battery costs have already dropped significantly since 2022 and are expected to fall below 2020 levels in 2024. While solar and battery manufacturers have enjoyed healthy margins, they are expected to face lower margins in the coming years. Downstream players, such as distributors and installers, may face challenges due to high inventories and declining prices. The oversupply and decreasing raw material prices in solar modules and batteries led to a price war in the second half of 2023, with further market consolidation expected in 2024. The global wind turbine supply market is historically divided between Chinese manufacturers serving the domestic market and Western firms catering to the rest of the world.\xa0', ""On a more positive note, one of the key commitments from COP28 is to triple global renewables capacity by 2030 to 11 terawatts. This initiative aims to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels in global energy production. The pledge is part of a broader effort to decarbonize the energy sector, which is responsible for about three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions. Sultan al-Jaber, the United Arab Emirates' COP28 summit President, said:"", '""This can and will help transition the world away from unabated coal.""', ""Led by the European Union, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates, the pledge also includes plans to expand nuclear power, reduce methane emissions, and limit private finance for coal power. The goal of tripling renewable energy capacity is to eliminate CO2-emitting fossil fuels from the world's energy system by 2050 at the latest."", 'In this article, we discuss the best green stocks to invest in 2024, including General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), NextEra Energy, Inc.

For instance, software giant Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has its own RPA tool, called Power Automate. Yet, the company often turns to UiPath when a client needs an enterprise-class automation tool.', '""Microsoft has named us their preferred automation partner,"" said UiPath CFO Ashim Gupta at a recent industry conference. ""You don\'t see Microsoft talking about automating claims processing, automating customs forms applications, automating invoice-to-cash. You don\'t see that with them. And that is where we shine and they know we shine.""', ""That's a strong vote of confidence from one of the world's most competent and powerful software developers.

But what if AI itself could become disrupted by a new form of computing?"", 'That\'s quantum computing, a process whereby stimulating an atomic ion, a quantum ""qbit"" can process exponentially more data than a typical electronic transistor, which can only store data in binary form of ""1"" or ""0."" So even though Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), for instance, packs 80 billion transistors onto its H100 GPU for AI, each of those transistors is still in the form of ""1"" or ""0.""', ""That means quantum computing, if done right, could solve problems that even the largest AI supercomputers couldn't."", ""The reason why a quantum revolution hasn't happened, of course, is that the technology is super-hard to get right. But it's getting closer every day, and leading the charge is industry leader IonQ. With a market cap of just over $2 billion, IonQ is the largest publicly traded pure-play quantum computing company."", 'There are several different approaches to the technology of quantum computing, and IonQ has chosen what appears to be a more direct route to commercialization via something called an atomic ion trap method. In that process, an ion is suspended in an electromagnetic field, and hit with various lasers to stimulate the ion and then also measure the various probabilities of quantum states. Atomic ions are natural and not fabricated as some other materials other quantum players are attempting to use. And trapped ions can process data at room temperature, whereas other approaches require temperatures near absolute zero.', ""IonQ's approach seems to be gaining traction, as the company just announced it hit a technological milestone of hitting #AQ 35, or a 35 algorithmic qbit system, one year ahead of schedule. That's important because a working #AQ 35 system is thought by management to be the threshold whereby quantum computing achieves computing superiority over quantum simulations from traditional computers, for certain applications."", 'In addition, IonQ just completed its buildout of a quantum manufacturing center and second quantum data center outside of Seattle, where its quantum system can be accessed by all major clouds.', ""With IonQ's technology having hit a threshold where it may become commercially preferable to traditional computing for some applications, as well as its strong partnerships with major cloud computing platforms, look for 2024 to be a year in which IonQ potentially goes from experimental start-up to a genuine money-maker."", ""It's possible a quantum ChatGPT-like moment could be on the horizon in the next few years."", ""Nicholas Rossolillo (Shift4 Payments): One of the stocks I'm looking forward to hearing from most this earnings season is Shift4 Payments, a small digital payments provider that got its start providing solutions to the hospitality industry. It's been quickly expanding up-market to big sports stadiums and entertainment venues, and also just made a small acquisition to jump-start its expansion into Europe."", ""Intense competition has been a highlight in the digital payments space in the last year, with old industry giant PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ: PYPL) taking the brunt of the market's souring on this industry. Consolidation is likely needed, but big players in the space apparently think there's still lots of value -- if the recent announcement that credit company Capital One Financial (NYSE: COF) will try to acquire credit and payments network provider Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) is any indication."", 'Despite headwinds, though, Shift4 has been a solid growth story. Through the first nine months of 2023 (the Q4 update will be released on Feb. 27), revenue increased 28% year-over-year. Even better than that, though, Shift4 could be at the cusp of reaching some serious operating leverage as it expands. GAAP net income through the first nine months of the year jumped 58%, and free cash flow (FCF) surged 149% to $242 million.', ""Like most businesses, Shift4 isn't flawless. One area to keep an eye on is the balance sheet, which had $692 million in cash and short-term investments offset by debt of $1.75 billion -- the result of a number of acquisitions over the years."", ""Nevertheless, I've added to a small position in Shift4 stock in recent months on optimism the small fintech company's growth will extend into 2024 and beyond. Shares could be mighty cheap for the long-term too, at 46 times trailing 12-month earnings per share and just 20 times FCF.

Since closing its takeover of Vmware last November, Broadcom aims to generate about half of its revenue from its software business."", ""AMD's revenue and adjusted EPS rose 44% and 25%, respectively, in 2022, but most of that growth came from the acquisition of Xilinx. That inorganic growth masked AMD's slower sales of PC CPUs and GPUs in a post-pandemic market."", ""But in 2023 AMD's revenue and adjusted EPS fell 4% and 24%, respectively, as it lapped that acquisition and grappled with the PC market's ongoing slowdown. Sluggish sales of Sony's PS5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X consoles -- which all use AMD's semi-custom APUs -- exacerbated that pain. AMD offset some of that pressure by selling more Epyc CPUs and Instinct GPUs for data centers."", ""In 2024, analysts expect AMD's revenue and adjusted EPS to rise 14% and 36%, respectively, as the PC market stabilizes and it ramps up its shipments of Instinct GPUs for the AI market. That acceleration indicates that AMD has finally passed its cyclical trough, but its stock isn't cheap at 53 times forward earnings. A resurgent Intel could also start gaining ground against AMD in the PC and server markets over the next few years."", ""Broadcom's revenue and EPS rose 21% and 77%, respectively, in fiscal 2022. That growth was driven by brisk sales of its chips across the hyperscale, service provider, and enterprise markets. Its infrastructure software business also grew."", ""In fiscal 2023, Broadcom's revenue and EPS grew 8% and 12%, respectively. Its strong sales of data center chips for AI applications -- along with the steady growth of its software business -- offset its slower chip sales to Apple and its industrial customers. And unlike AMD, Broadcom didn't have too much exposure to the weak PC market."", ""Analysts expect Broadcom's revenue and EPS to grow 40% and 10%, respectively, in fiscal 2024, but most of its top-line growth will be driven by its recent acquisition of VMware. For fiscal 2025, analysts expect its revenue and EPS to rise 11% and 20%, respectively, as it laps that acquisition.

The company is launching a new flagship large language model called Mistral Large. When it comes to reasoning capabilities, it is designed to rival other top-tier models, such as GPT-4 and Claude 2.', 'In addition to Mistral Large, the startup is also launching its own alternative to ChatGPT with a new service called Le Chat. This chat assistant is currently available in beta.', 'If you’re not familiar with Mistral AI, the company is better known for its capitalization table, as it raised an obscene amount of money in very little time to develop foundational AI models. The company was officially incorporated in May 2023. Just a few weeks after that, Mistral AI raised a $113 million seed round. In December, the company closed a $415 million funding round, with Andreessen Horowitz (a16z) leading the round.', 'Founded by alums from Google’s DeepMind and Meta, Mistral AI originally positioned itself as an AI company with an open source focus. While Mistral AI’s first model was released under an open source license with access to model weights, that’s not the case for its larger models.', 'Mistral AI’s business model looks more and more like OpenAI’s business model as the company offers Mistral Large through a paid API with usage-based pricing. It currently costs $8 per million of input tokens and $24 per million of output tokens to query Mistral Large. In artificial language jargon, tokens represent small chunks of words — for example, the word “TechCrunch” would be split in two tokens, ""Tech"" and ""Crunch,"" when processed by an AI model.', 'By default, Mistral AI supports context windows of 32k tokens (generally more than 20,000 words in English). Mistral Large supports English, French, Spanish, German and Italian.', 'As a comparison, GPT-4 Turbo, which has a 128k-token context window, currently costs $10 per million of input tokens and $30 per million of output tokens. So Mistral Large is currently 20% cheaper than GPT-4 Turbo. Things are changing at a rapid pace and AI companies update their pricing regularly.', 'But how does Mistral Large stack up against GPT-4 and Claude 2? As always, it’s very hard to tell. Mistral AI claims that it ranks second after GPT-4 based on several benchmarks. But there could be some benchmark cherry-picking and disparities in real-life usage. We’ll have to dig more to see how it performs in our tests.', 'Image Credits: Mistral AI', 'Mistral AI is also launching a chat assistant today called Le Chat.

It's also worth noting that Le Chat can't access the web when you use it."", 'The company also plans to launch a paid version of Le Chat for enterprise clients. In addition to central billing, enterprise clients will be able to define moderation mechanisms.', 'Finally, Mistral AI is also using today’s news drop to announce a partnership with Microsoft. In addition to Mistral’s own API platform, Microsoft is going to provide Mistral models to its Azure customers.', 'It’s another model in Azure’s model catalog, which doesn’t seem that big of a deal.

The first benefit of that partnership is that Mistral AI will likely attract more customers with this new distribution channel.', 'As for Microsoft, the company is the main investor of OpenAI’s capped profit subsidiary.

A growing number of individuals are becoming attracted to ESG investments for a variety of reasons, ranging from ethical concerns to sound financial decision-making. As per research conducted by deVere Group, over 800 clients revealed that more than half (56%) of investors expressed their intentions to boost their investments in ESG funds in 2024.', 'Despite the increasing popularity of ESG investing, the year 2023 did not fare well for such investment strategies. Investors persisted in withdrawing their investments from sustainable funds during the fourth quarter of 2023. U.S. sustainable funds experienced their initial year of outflows since records began over a decade ago, marking 2023 as their most challenging year to date, according to a report by Morningstar. In the fourth quarter alone, investors withdrew $5 billion from U.S. sustainable funds, contributing to a total outflow of $13 billion throughout the year. This trend was attributed to underperformance, ongoing political scrutiny in the US, and a challenging year for an iShares fund. Moreover, by the end of 2023, the total assets invested in sustainable funds reached $323 billion. This figure indicates a drop of approximately 12% from the previous record high recorded at the end of 2021. However, it also signifies an 18% increase from the lowest point observed in the third quarter of 2022. In contrast, assets within the broader U.S. funds market reached their peak at the end of 2021 but experienced a decline of 5% by the end of 2023.', 'That said, analysts are optimistic about the potential of ESG investing in the foreseeable future. Based on a study conducted by Bloomberg Intelligence, global ESG assets are projected to surpass $53 trillion by 2025, constituting more than a third of the estimated total assets under management of $140.5 trillion. The convergence of factors including the pandemic and the green recovery initiatives in major economies such as the U.S., EU, and China is expected to demonstrate the efficacy of ESG in evaluating a fresh array of financial risks and leveraging capital markets.', 'As discussed previously, there is a growing trend among investors towards ESG investing, primarily due to the reputation of these assets for delivering consistent returns. Contrary to concerns regarding potential conflicts between financial gains and ESG principles, a survey conducted by PwC revealed that nine out of ten asset managers believe that incorporating ESG criteria into their investment approach will enhance overall returns. Moreover, a majority of institutional investors, accounting for 60%, reported experiencing higher performance yields from ESG investments compared to non-ESG alternatives. The survey also noted that investors are willing to pay for ESG performance, as they anticipate the potential for higher returns. Specifically, three-quarters of those surveyed, constituting 78%, expressed their readiness to pay elevated fees for ESG funds.', 'American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), AT&T Inc.

(Nasdaq: SNPS) today released the ninth edition of the annual ""Open Source Security and Risk Analysis"" (OSSRA) report. The research highlights that nearly three-quarters of commercial codebases assessed for risk contain open source components impacted by high-risk vulnerabilities, representing a sharp uptick from the previous year.', 'In the 2024 OSSRA report, the Synopsys Cybersecurity Research Center (CyRC) analyzes anonymized findings from more than 1,000 commercial codebase audits across 17 industries. The report provides security, development and legal teams with a comprehensive view of the open source landscape, including trends in the adoption and use of open source software as well as the prevalence of security vulnerabilities, and software licensing and code quality risks.', 'While codebases containing at least one open source vulnerability remained consistent year over year at 84%, significantly more codebases contained high-risk vulnerabilities in 2023. This can potentially be attributed to variables like economic instability and the consequent layoffs of tech workers, reducing the number of resources available to patch vulnerabilities. According to the data, the percentage of codebases with high-risk open source vulnerabilities — those that have been actively exploited, have documented proof-of-concept exploits or are classified as remote code execution vulnerabilities — increased from 48% in 2022 to 74% in 2023.', '""This year\'s OSSRA report indicates an alarming rise in high-risk open source vulnerabilities across a variety of critical industries, leaving them at risk for exploitation by cybercriminals,"" said Jason Schmitt, general manager, Synopsys Software Integrity Group. ""The increasing pressure on software teams to move faster and do more with less in 2023 has likely contributed to this sharp rise in open source vulnerabilities. Malicious actors have taken note of this attack vector, so maintaining proper software hygiene by identifying, tracking and managing open source effectively is a key element to strengthening the security of the software supply chain.""', 'Additional key findings from the 2024 OSSRA report include', 'A ""zombie code"" apocalypse: Organizations are depending on outdated or inactive open source components. Ninety-one percent of codebases contained components that were 10 or more versions out-of-date, and nearly half (49%) of codebases contained components that had no development activity within the past two years. The report also found that the mean age of open source vulnerabilities in the codebases was over 2.5 years old, and nearly a quarter of codebases contained vulnerabilities more than 10 years old.', 'High-risk open source vulnerabilities permeate across critical industries: The Computer Hardware and Semiconductors industry had the highest percentage of codebases with high-risk open source vulnerabilities (88%), followed closely by Manufacturing, Industrials and Robotics at 87%. Closer to the middle of the pack, the Big Data, AI, BI and Machine Learning industry had 66% of its codebases impacted by high-risk vulnerabilities. At the bottom of the list, the Aerospace, Aviation, Automotive, Transportation and Logistics industry still had high-risk vulnerabilities in a third (33%) of its codebases.', 'Open source license challenges remain:\xa0License compliance is an important aspect of effective software supply chain management, but the report found that over half (53%) of the codebases contained open source license conflicts, and 31% of codebases were using code with either no discernible license or a customized license. Once again, the Computer Hardware and Semiconductors industry ranked highest in percentage of codebases containing license conflicts at 92% followed by Manufacturing, Industrials and Robotics at 81%. Just one noncompliant license in software can result in loss of lucrative intellectual property, time-consuming remediation and delays in getting products to market.', 'Eight of the top 10 vulnerabilities trace back to one common weakness type: The majority of the open source vulnerabilities that were observed most frequently in this research are classified as Improper Neutralization weaknesses (CWE-707). This weakness type includes the various forms of cross-site scripting that, if exploited, can be quite severe.', 'To learn more about the 2024 OSSRA findings, download a copy of the report, read the blog post or register for the March 28th webinar.', ""About the Synopsys Software Integrity GroupSynopsys Software Integrity Group provides integrated solutions that transform the way development teams build and deliver software, accelerating innovation while addressing business risk.

The prudent pricing of cigarettes has been supporting the revenues of players in the tobacco industry in the face of declining volumes.', 'Smoke-Free Products Gain Prominence: Rising health consciousness and stringent government regulations aimed at reducing cigarette smoking have driven many consumers toward reduced-risk products (RRPs) or smoke-free alternatives.

Such regulatory norms are imposed due to health hazards caused by the consumption of nicotine. Some guidelines issued by the FDA include the mandatory use of precautionary labels on cigarette packets and self-critical advertisements. As cigarette sales constitute a significant portion of revenues for tobacco industry companies, the decrease in sales volumes within this category raises concerns.', 'Cost Pressures: The performance of numerous industry participants has been adversely affected by cost inflation.

Lastly, the company's 5-year EBITDA growth rate of 6.10%, underperforms approximately 61.96% of global competitors."", ""In conclusion, The Goldman Sachs Group Inc's dividend payments, consistent growth rate, and reasonable payout ratio all point to a dividend that is sustainable in the short term. The company's profitability, despite being fair, could be a concern if the downward trend in earnings persists. However, the impressive yield on cost over five years may continue to attract investors seeking income-generating stocks. Investors should also consider The Goldman Sachs Group Inc's growth metrics, which indicate potential challenges ahead.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer cyclical sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Invest In.\xa0', 'Consumer cyclical companies produce goods and services that are considered non-essential or discretionary, meaning consumers are more likely to purchase them when they have extra income or feel confident about their financial situation. Consumer cyclical stocks include companies in sectors such as retail, automotive, travel and leisure, entertainment, and luxury goods.', ""Over the past year, we've seen clear evidence that consumers have remained strong despite challenges like high inflation, increasing interest rates, and greater recession concerns. This resilience notably buoyed the performance of stocks within the consumer discretionary sector, which includes businesses offering non-essential products and services such as apparel, automobiles, and accommodations. The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index ended 2023 with a total return of 42.41%, reporting one of its best years on record. In addition to the support from a strong consumer base, the stocks in this sector also gained from broader market trends that propelled the overall stock market higher in 2023. These trends included relief as the Federal Reserve signaled the potential end of its rate-hiking cycle as the year progressed. Furthermore, sector-level performance was boosted by specific issues affecting some of the largest companies within it. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), the two largest companies in the sector by a significant margin, have both seen remarkable gains in the past year, driven by the surge in mega-cap, tech-related stocks. Additionally, both companies are considered potential investment opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence."", ""After experiencing robust performance in 2023, analysts are also showing a preference for the sector in the current year. Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, stated that consumers' willingness to sustain moderate spending growth has been crucial for the economy. He suggested that this could be attributed, at least in part, to the robust labor market and notable wage increases. Based on a Fidelity report, the performance of sectors is expected to be influenced by broader economic factors in 2024. If inflation remains low and the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates, it could be advantageous for the sector, as consumers may be more inclined to buy expensive items like cars or homes. An even more positive scenario would be if the economy avoids a recession and job markets stay robust, which would particularly benefit this sector."", ""The report highlighted that following the sector's strong performance in 2023, stock valuations are not as low as they were previously. However, there are still segments of the market where the firm has identified robust long-term growth prospects, and where stocks are trading at attractive prices. One ongoing area of opportunity includes certain retailers. These companies possess defensive characteristics within their business models, offering some protection in case of a deteriorating economic outlook."", 'Another factor contributing to the positive outlook for the sector is that certain companies within it opt to distribute dividends when they maintain a steady cash flow and have a track record of sharing profits with shareholders. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), and NIKE, Inc.

But if you pay close attention, you might find that its key financial indicators look quite decent, which could mean that the stock could potentially rise in the long-term given how markets usually reward more resilient long-term fundamentals. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Aptiv's  ROE today."", 'Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' View our latest analysis for Aptiv ', 'The formula for return on equity is:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Aptiv is:', '25% = US$3.0b ÷ US$12b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.25 in profit."", 'Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don\'t have the same features.', ""First thing first, we like that Aptiv has an impressive ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 12% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Given the circumstances, we can't help but wonder why Aptiv saw little to no growth in the past five years. Based on this, we feel that there might be other reasons which haven't been discussed so far in this article that could be hampering the company's growth. Such as, the company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures."", ""Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Aptiv's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 11% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see."", 'Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is APTV worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether APTV is currently mispriced by the market.', ""Aptiv doesn't pay any dividend, which means that it is retaining all of its earnings. This makes us question why the company is retaining so much of its profits and still generating almost no growth? It looks like there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline."", ""On the whole, we do feel that Aptiv has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink.

A ""non-GAAP financial measure"" is defined as a numerical measure of a company\'s financial performance that excludes or includes amounts different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) in the statements of operations, balance sheets or statements of cash flows of the Company. Pursuant to the requirements of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company has provided reconciliations to the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures for the following non-GAAP financial measures referred to in this press release:', 'net sales growth on an organic basis, which excludes acquisitions, divested businesses, exited product lines, and the impact of currency,', 'adjusted gross profit,', 'adjusted net income,', 'adjusted operating income,', 'adjusted diluted earnings per share,', 'constant currency net sales growth, adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share,', 'adjusted gross margin, and', 'operating cash flow conversion.', 'These non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. The Company presents these non-GAAP financial measures in order to provide transparency to our investors because they are measures that management uses to assess both management performance and the financial performance of our operations and to allocate resources. In addition, management believes that these measures may assist investors with understanding and evaluating our initiatives to drive improved financial performance and enables investors to supplementally compare our operating performance with the operating performance of our competitors including with those of our competitors having different capital structures. While we have excluded certain of these items from historical non-GAAP financial measures, there is no guarantee that the items excluded from non-GAAP financial measures will not continue into future periods. For instance, we expect to continue to experience charges for facility exit and impairment charges and inventory write-downs related to store closures as the Company continues to complete a multi-year strategic initiative designed to improve overall performance. We also expect to continue to experience and report restructuring-related charges associated with continued execution of our strategic initiatives.', ""The Company provides non-GAAP financial measures as additional information that it believes is useful to investors and analysts in evaluating the performance of the Company's ongoing operating trends, facilitating comparability between periods and, where applicable, with companies in similar industries and assessing the Company's prospects for future performance. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude items, such as impairment charges, restructuring charges, and acquisition and integration-related charges, that by their nature affect comparability of operational performance or that we believe obscure underlying business operational trends. The intangible asset amortization excluded from these non-GAAP financial measure represents the entire amount recorded within the Company's GAAP financial statements and is excluded because the amortization, unlike the related revenue, is not affected by operations of any particular period unless an intangible asset becomes impaired or the estimated useful life of an intangible asset is revised. The revenue generated by the associated intangible assets has not been excluded from the related non-GAAP financial measure. The non-GAAP measures the Company provides are consistent with how management analyzes and assesses the operating performance of the Company, and disclosing them provides investor insight into management's view of the business. Management uses these adjusted financial measures for planning and forecasting in future periods, and evaluating segment and overall operating performance. In addition, management uses certain of the profit measures as factors in determining compensation."", ""Non-GAAP measures related to profit measurements, which include adjusted gross profit, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted EPS, constant currency adjusted diluted EPS, constant currency adjusted operating income, adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors as they provide them with supplemental information to enhance their understanding of the Company's underlying business performance and trends, and enhance the ability of investors and analysts to compare the Company's period-to-period financial results. Management believes that adjusted gross margin and adjusted operating margin are useful to investors, in addition to the reasons discussed above, by allowing them to more easily compare and analyze trends in the Company's peer business group and assisting them in comparing the Company's overall performance to that of its competitors. The Company also discloses net sales growth excluding the impact of currency on an organic basis. The Company believes these supplemental financial measures provide investors with consistency in financial reporting, enabling meaningful comparisons of past and present underlying operating results,

Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Phillips 66's  ROE."", ""Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits."", ' View our latest analysis for Phillips 66 ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Phillips 66 is:', '23% = US$7.2b ÷ US$32b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.23 in profit."", 'We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company\'s future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.', ""Firstly, we acknowledge that Phillips 66 has a significantly high ROE. Further, even comparing with the industry average if 21%, the company's ROE is quite respectable. As a result, Phillips 66's remarkable 30% net income growth seen over the past 5 years is likely aided by its high ROE."", ""We then performed a comparison between Phillips 66's net income growth with the industry, which revealed that the company's growth is similar to the average industry growth of 36% in the same 5-year period."", 'Earnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is PSX worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether PSX is currently mispriced by the market.', ""Phillips 66's three-year median payout ratio to shareholders is 17%, which is quite low. This implies that the company is retaining 83% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business as evidenced by the growth seen by the company."", ""Besides, Phillips 66 has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Looking at the current analyst consensus data, we can see that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 36% over the next three years. Consequently, the higher expected payout ratio explains the decline in the company's expected ROE (to 18%) over the same period."", ""On the whole, we feel that Phillips 66's performance has been quite good. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. With that said, on studying the latest analyst forecasts, we found that while the company has seen growth in its past earnings, analysts expect its future earnings to shrink. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

PSTG projects Evergreen//One and Evergreen//Flex solutions to generate revenues of $400 million in fiscal 2024.The rapid proliferation of generative AI is expected to have boosted demand for FlashBlade and Portworx products. Increased customer adoption of Portworx storage software for databases, messaging and logging systems is a tailwind.Apart from this, continued momentum in its subscription services is likely to have boosted Pure Storage’s fiscal fourth-quarter performance. We expect revenues from subscription services to be $279.2 million, up 5.3% year over year for the fiscal fourth quarter.An expanded customer base (especially large enterprise clients) along with strength in commercial business bode well.However, the company expects fiscal 2024 revenues to be affected by increased shift to Evergreen//One solution and a delay in fulfillment of a $41 million non-cancelable product order until next year with a Telco customer. On a combined basis, these two factors represent 4.5 basis points of incremental headwind to revenues compared with the annual revenue guidance of growth in mid-to-high single digits provided by PSTG at the beginning of the year, added management.The company now expects fiscal 2024 revenues to be $2.82 billion, representing a rise of 2.5% from the year-ago levels. The non-GAAP operating margin is expected to be 16%, up from 15.5% projected earlier.Weakness in global macroeconomic conditions and stiff competition in the flash-based storage market remain concerning.

Many of them develop lifesaving drugs, the kinds we'll need until we can completely eradicate diseases, which doesn't seem likely to happen in the next decade."", ""Of course, investing in just any biotech stock won't do. It's important to decide whether a company has the innovative capabilities to stay relevant and continuously deliver strong returns. Let's consider three biotech stocks that have what it takes: CRISPR Therapeutics (NASDAQ: CRSP), Axsome Therapeutics (NASDAQ: AXSM), and Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN)."", ""CRISPR Therapeutics is on a roll. The company recently earned approval for its first product, Casgevy, a gene-editing therapy for a couple of rare blood diseases. Developed in collaboration with biotech giant Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Casgevy should have massive commercial success. CRISPR and Vertex estimate a total patient population of at least 35,000, and the treatment costs $2.2 million per patient in the U.S. Even grabbing just 30% of that target market would mean billions of dollars in revenue. There aren't many competitors to contend with, either, so things are looking good for CRISPR and Vertex."", ""CRISPR Therapeutics gained substantial prominence thanks to this regulatory nod, because the biotech focuses on developing CRISPR-based therapies. Despite landing its creators a Nobel prize in chemistry, this gene-editing technique had never before produced an approved medicine. Casgevy changed that, giving more credence to CRISPR Therapeutics' entire platform."", ""In the next few years, investors should expect significant clinical progress from the biotech's several pipeline candidates, helping to expand its future lineup. CRISPR Therapeutics has delivered solid returns since its 2016 initial public offering, and the biotech isn't about to stop now."", ""Axsome Therapeutics has experienced significant clinical and regulatory progress over the past three years, culminating in the approval of Auvelity, a treatment for depression, in 2022. Axsome's lineup also features narcolepsy therapy Sunosi, acquired in 2022 from Jazz Pharmaceuticals."", ""These two medicines are generating growing sales. Last year, Axsome Therapeutics' revenue came in at about $270 million, much better than the roughly $50 million reported in 2022."", ""Meanwhile, Auvelity is being tested in Alzheimer's disease agitation (aggressive and restless symptoms) and should soon start a pivotal study in smoking cessation. Sunosi will soon kick off late-stage studies in depression, binge eating disorder, and shift work sleep disorder (disruptions in sleep rhythms caused by unconventional working hours); it has an ongoing late-stage study targeting ADHD."", ""And there's more good news: Axsome has a rich late-stage pipeline that should yield more clinical and regulatory wins in the next few years. It's running a phase 3 study for AXS-12 targeting narcolepsy, while it plans to submit regulatory applications for AXS-07 for migraine and AXS-14 for fibromyalgia (a chronic disease that causes pain and trouble sleeping)."", ""The company's lineup should be transformed in the next three years, setting up a solid foundation for consistent revenue growth and stock-market performance through 2034."", 'Amgen is a well-established biotech company with a long list of marketed products. However, the drugmaker has been dealing with slow or nonexistent revenue growth due to competition.', ""The biotech has a plan to turn things around. It's developing new therapies, and this includes the highly promising weight-loss area. Sales of anti-obesity drugs are projected to skyrocket in the coming years, and Amgen hopes to capture a piece of this market. Amgen also acquired Horizon Therapeutics for $28 billion last year, a move that significantly expanded its lineup and pipeline."", ""Furthermore, the drugmaker has been making a push in the biosimilars market, another promising industry considering that most people think prescription drugs are too expensive. Amgen is working on biosimilar versions of several blockbusters, from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' Eylea, a treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (an eye disease), to Bristol Myers Squibb's cancer drug Opdivo."", ""Amgen has a deep pipeline and a long history of developing newer and better medicines, so it should do just fine.

Good morning to everyone, and thanks for joining us to review PSEG's 2023 fourth quarter and full year results. For the fourth quarter of 2023, PSEG reported net income of $1.10 per share compared to net income of $1.58 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP operating earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 were $0.54 per share compared to $0.64 per share in the fourth quarter of 2022. Our non-GAAP results, excluding the items shown in attachments 8 and 9, which we provided with the earnings release. For the full year of 2023, PSEG reported net income of $5.13 per share compared to $2.06 per share for the full year of 2022. Our non-GAAP operating earnings of $3.48 per share for the full year came in at the high end of our 2023 guidance range of $3.40 to $3.50 per share and marked the 19th consecutive year that we delivered results meeting or exceeding our guidance. Our fourth quarter 2023 financial results capped off a solid operating year. Building on this result, you can see on Slide 5 that we also reaffirm PSEG's full year 2024 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.70 per share as well as our 5% to 7% earnings CAGR through 2028, and our $18 billion to $21 billion regulated CapEx plan that supports our rate base CAGR of 6% to 7.5% through 2028. In rolling forward our 5-year capital plan to 2028, we added approximately $3 billion of investments to the prior plan that started from a year-end 2023 rate base of $29 billion. These are all unchanged from our January 2024 investor updates and we continue to identify potential investment opportunities for future rate base growth. Dan will discuss our financial results in greater detail following my remarks. So I will focus on a quick look back than on our outlook and objectives for 2024. Since our last earnings call, PSE&G has submitted 2 important filings to the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities. In early December 2023, we filed our $3.1 billion Energy Efficiency II investment program. This significantly expanded offerings driven by an increase in work to achieve the savings targets required under the BPU's updated energy efficiency framework. If approved, this program will launch the state's second energy efficiency cycle beginning in January of 2025 and run through June of 2027 with investments made over a 6-year period. Our EE II filing aligns with the annual reduction goals of 0.75% for gas and 2% for electric contained in New Jersey's Clean Energy Act of 2018, which are all unchanged and extends through the 2027 program year. In the interim, we continue to conduct our award-winning Energy Efficiency program, which remains oversubscribed. This last November, we filed for a second extension to this program totaling approximately $300 million covering the July through year-end 2024 period. As a direct result of these programs, PSE&G is also advancing its Clean Energy Jobs program with a focus on lower and middle-income community hiring and training. Our EE programs continue to create value by lowering customer bills, reducing energy use and emissions and providing shareholders over the return of and on the energy efficiency spending. New Jersey continues to be a national leader in promoting the broad adoption of EE, and it remains an important tool in helping us reach New Jersey's clean energy goals. The second regulatory filing we made in December was our first distribution base rate case in nearly 6 years. This case addresses 57% of our rate base, given that the other 43% is regulated under our first formula rate. You're aware that this filing was required pursuant to the settlement of our second gas system modernization program back in 2018. The filing proposes an overall revenue increase of 9% with the typical combined residential electric and gas customers seeing a proposed increase of 12% or less than 2% of compounded growth over the 6-year period. We expect the procedural schedule for this rate case to be issued in the near term. And based on previous rate case timelines, we anticipate that this rate case will conclude later in 2024. The largest item in the rate case is to obtain recovery of our capital expenditures, already made to modernize system infrastructure and improve reliability but not yet in rates as well as to implement recovery of expenditures for the previously approved AMI and electric vehicle programs. Besides capital recovery, the rate case proposes several mechanisms to mitigate the impact of market volatility on customer bills, including insulating customers from swing in interest rates, severe weather events and revenue-related impacts of pension, providing for a more predictable monthly bill. We are also proposing a new time of use rates that will allow customers to save on their bills by shifting usage to off-peak periods, a rate option that can benefit all customers, including incentivizing residential customers to charge their electric vehicles during these off-peak hours. The BPU has added several commissioners in the past year. Phil Murphy recently appointed Michael Bange, a retired water utility executive with operations experience. The new commissioners continue to advance a full agenda, and we already have several data points over the past 6 months that are consistent with prior results, including 2 recent rate case settlements that adopted the existing New Jersey's return on equity rate of 9.6%. These agreements between the BPU staff, Rate Counsel, other interveners and the utilities demonstrate a continued preference for settlements over adjudicated cases in New Jersey. In 2023, the BPU will also approve settlements to extend our GSMP II program for 2 years to invest $900 million on infrastructure monetization and greenhouse gas reduction as well as a 9-month extension for $280 million, covering our EEI program through June of 2024. If you followed us for several years, you know that we are also laser-focused on cost containment. In 2023, we were able to lock in 4-year labor agreements with all our New Jersey represented employees, which addresses one of our largest O&M costs. This is just one example of our relentless cost discipline, which has positioned our distribution rate case increases to be the lowest in the state over the 6 years since our last rate case filing back in 2018. A comparison of our in-state electric and gas distribution rate increases since our last rate case is shown on Slide 12. PSE&G's electric distribution CAGR was less than 1/3 of the average New Jersey electric CAGR and our gas distribution CAGR was less than half of the average New Jersey gas CAGR. PSE&G's customer bills continue to compare very well with regional peers for residential electric and gas service and remain lower from a historical share of wallet basis. Of considerable note was our ability to reduce monthly bills for typical net residential natural gas customers with 3 commodity reductions during 2023 prior to the 2024 heating season. In addition to this focus on affordability, we continue to provide outstanding reliability. For the 22nd consecutive year, PSE&G received a Reliability One award in the Mid-Atlantic metropolitan service area from PA Consulting, an industry benchmarking group. We are very proud, it combines our reputation for reliability and our regionally favorable affordability with nationally recognized customer satisfaction scores. PSE&G ranked #1 for the second consecutive year in the J.D. Power 2023 U.S. Electric Utility Residential Customer Satisfaction Study in the East among our large utilities. We also secured the top position in the J.D. Power 2023 U.S. electric utility business customer satisfaction study in that same region. Now let's turn to our capital investment programs. During the fourth quarter of 2023, PSE&G invested approximately $1 billion in energy infrastructure and clean energy, bringing the full capital spend to $3.7 billion, our largest ever single year expenditure. As I mentioned earlier, PSE&G finished 2023 with a total rate base of approximately $29 billion, which was a 10% increase over year-end 2022 rate base. A key driver of this growth is our energy efficiency program, which continues to experience higher demand for residential and C&I offerings, accounting for close to $480 million of the $3.7 billion. Our infrastructure advancement program, which is focused on modernizing the last mile of our system has never been more critical as activity in response to new service requests for EV make-ready and additional large specific projects including data centers picks up. We also installed and placed into service 1.5 million smart meters through our CEF Advanced Metering program or AMI. The total AMI program, which is intended to replace more than 2.3 million meters in total is expected to be completed this year, still on schedule and on budget. Now turning to our nuclear operations. The nuclear production tax credit provided in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act began on January 1 of this year and extends through 2032 with a payment of up to $15 a megawatt hour based on nuclear units gross receipts. Our nuclear fleet operated 93% capacity factor for the full year of 2023, producing approximately 32 terawatt hours of carbon-free baseload energy, which included a Salem 1 breaker-to-breaker run between refuelings. In wrapping up, I want to note a few other highlights. For the 16th consecutive year, PSEG has been named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. And for 2024, PSEG will also be included in the S&P Global Sustainability Yearbook. U.S. News & World Report also recently named PSEG to its inaugural list of 200 best companies to work for. And in 2023, we were recognized by the CPA-Zicklin Index as a trendsetter for corporate political disclosure practices and accountability. We also completed the sale of our last fossil unit in Hawaii last year, making PSEG Power one of the few carbon-free baseload generating fleets in the country. This fleet is well situated to benefit from potential data center growth, hydrogen hubs and a license extension with none of the potential upside in our current 5-year plan. PSE&G continues to execute on a robust set of growth investments aligned with New Jersey's energy policy goals as well as expected growth from increased electrification, including EV adoption, port electrification as well as new business, including data center loads. These last 2 mentions were recently recognized by PJM in their January 2024 load forecast report for our PS zone. We are very pleased with the progress made thus far to increase the predictability of PSEG. An important part of achieving this comes from our ability to execute on our current 5-year capital investment plan without the need to issue new equity or sell assets. PSEG has delivered on what we said we would do, and I look forward with confidence in this team's ability to continue to execute on our business plan in the years ahead. I'd like to close my remarks by thanking all 12,500 plus PSEG employees for their dedication and safety, reliability and our customers. I'll now turn the call over to Dan to discuss our financial results and outlook in greater detail and I'll be available for your questions after his remarks."", 'Daniel J. Cregg', ""Thank you, Ralph, and good morning, everyone. As Ralph mentioned earlier, PSEG reported net income of $5.13 per share for the full year of '23 compared to net income of $2.06 per share for 2022.

For the fourth quarter of 2023, net income was $1.10 per share compared to $1.58 per share in 2022, and non-GAAP operating earnings were $0.54 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to $0.64 per share in 2022. We've provided you with information on Slide 7 and 9 regarding the contribution to non-GAAP operating earnings per share by business segment for the fourth quarter and full year of 2023. Slides 8 and 10 contain waterfall charts that take you through the net changes, the quarter-over-quarter and full year periods and non-GAAP operating earnings per share by major business. Starting with PSE&G, we reported fourth quarter 2023 net income of $0.58 per share compared to $0.70 per share in 2022. PSE&G had non-GAAP operating earnings of $0.59 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to $0.70 per share in 2022. The main drivers for both net income and non-GAAP operating earnings results for the quarter were growth in investments in transmission and gas distribution. These favorable items were offset by the expected decline in pension income and lower OPEB-related credits as well as anticipated higher depreciation, amortization and interest expense resulting from higher investments not yet reflected in rates and the timing of O&M in the quarter that was within our expectations for the full year. Compared to fourth quarter 2022, margin was $0.03 higher, driven by transmission at $0.01 per share, and gas margin also at $0.01 per share higher, primarily driven by the clause recovery of our GSMP investment. Other utility margin was also $0.01 per share favorable. Distribution O&M expense increased $0.05 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting seasonality and operational timing. But for the full year, distribution O&M was flat versus 2022. Depreciation and interest expense each increased $0.02 per share compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting continued growth in investment, lower pension income resulting from 2022's investment returns, combined with lower OPEB credits, which ended in 2023, resulting in a $0.04 per share unfavorable comparison to the year earlier quarter. Lastly, the timing of taxes recorded through an effective tax rate, which nets to 0 across the full year and other flow-through taxes had a net unfavorable impact of $0.01 per share in the quarter compared to 2022. Weather during the fourth quarter, as measured by heating degree days, was 15% warmer than normal and 13% warmer than the fourth quarter of last year. As we've mentioned, the Conservation Incentive Program, or CIP mechanism, limits the impact of weather and other sales variances positive or negative on electric and gas margins while helping PSE&G broadly promote the adoption of its energy efficiency programs. Growth in the number of electric and gas customers, the driver for margin under the CIP mechanism has remained positive with each up by about 1% in 2023. On capital spending, as Ralph mentioned, PSE&G invested approximately $1 billion during the fourth quarter and completed its largest single year investment program at $3.7 billion for the full year. The program included upgrades and replacements to our T&D facilities, Energy Strong II investments, last mile spend in the infrastructure advancement program, ongoing gas infrastructure replacements via base and GSMP II spending, continued rollout of the clean energy investments in energy efficiency, smart meter installation and EV make-ready infrastructure. We recently rolled forward our 5-year regulated capital investment plan to 2028, amounting to $18 billion to $21 billion, which incorporates both the new $3.1 billion CEF-EE II filing as well as the $300 million expansion of the existing EE program through the end of 2024. For 2024, our regulated capital investment plan totals approximately $3.4 billion. Moving on to PSEG Power & Other. For the fourth quarter of 2023, PSEG Power & Other reported net income of $0.52 per share compared to net income of $0.88 per share for 2022. Non-GAAP operating loss was $0.05 per share for the fourth quarter of 2023 compared to a non-GAAP operating loss of $0.06 per share for 2022. For the fourth quarter of 2023, net energy margin rose by $0.05 per share after including lower capacity revenues that were $0.03 per share unfavorable and gas offset were lower by $0.01 per share compared to the year earlier quarter. O&M comparisons in the fourth quarter improved by $0.01 per share, driven by the absence of a Hope Creek refueling outage. Lower interest expense was $0.01 per share favorable, primarily the result of lower collateral requirements. Lower pension income from '22 investment returns and OPEB credits from the lower amortization benefit were $0.03 per share unfavorable versus fourth quarter of 2022. And taxes and other were $0.03 per share unfavorable compared to the fourth quarter of 2022, reflecting a partial reversal of the effective tax rate benefit from the first quarter of 2023. On the operating side, the nuclear fleet produced approximately 7.3 terawatt hours during the fourth quarter and 32 terawatt hours for the full year of 2023, running at a capacity factor of 86% and 93% for the quarter and full year respectively. At year-end 2023, PSEG Power had hedged approximately 90% to 95% of its expected generation for 2024 at an average price of $38 per megawatt hour, up from $31 per megawatt hour in 2023. Touching on some recent financing activity. As of December 31, PSEG had total available liquidity of $3.4 billion, including $54 million of cash on hand. PSEG Power had net cash collateral postings of approximately $113 million at December 31, more consistent with historical experience and substantially below the elevated levels seen during 2022. This reduction in collateral also helped to bolster PSEG's cash from operations to $3.8 billion for the full year 2023 versus $1.5 billion for the full year of 2022. At year-end 2023, PSEG had $500 million outstanding of a 364-day variable rate term loan maturing in April 2024 and PSEG Power had $1.25 billion outstanding of a variable rate term loan maturing in March of 2025. We've swapped a total of $1.4 billion from these 2 term loans at PSEG Power and PSEG from a variable to a fixed rate to mitigate variability in interest rates. As of December 31, reflecting our swaps, approximately 4% of our total debt was at a variable rate, which is down nearly 8% since year-end 2022, driven by a reduction in parent short-term debt of nearly $1.7 billion. We continue to maintain solid investment-grade ratings. Looking ahead, we expect that PSE&G's considerable cash generation combined with PSEG Power's enhanced cash flow visibility from the nuclear PTC will support the execution of PSEG's 5-year capital spending plan, which is dominated by regulated CapEx without the need to issue new equity or sell assets. In closing, we executed on our 19th year in a row of meeting or exceeding our non-GAAP operating earnings guidance. We are reaffirming PSEG's full year 2024 non-GAAP operating earnings guidance of $3.60 to $3.70 per share, and we are reaffirming the extension of our 5% to 7% operating earnings compounded annual growth rate through 2028. That concludes our formal remarks and we are now ready to begin the question-and-answer session."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) The first question is from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.', 'Constantine Lednev', ""It's actually Constantine here on for Shahriar. Congrats on a great quarter. Starting off on the power side of the business, do you see any further upside to earnings contribution from nuclear going beyond the sale of operates and refueling cycle adjustments like Hope Creek in '25 and maybe any pushes and takes as these could be accretive versus the utility growth on a consolidated basis?"", 'Ralph A. LaRossa', ""Constantine, I think we've been mentioning for quite some time that we've got -- we potentially have some upsides down from PPAs or something similar to that. But we're going to look at what the state -- how the state moves from an economic development standpoint and then make some decisions from there. And let me give you a very specific kind of thought process. We've done a lot of work down and around the plan in anticipation of the wind port. And so that work progressed and the state has been very happy with it. They've got some manufacturers that are either in the process of moving into that area or still considering it. But if they don't use all of that area, maybe we could look at an electrolyzer set up that could be down in that vicinity that could provide us with an opportunity. Maybe there could be a data center down in that area. But all of those things really are driven by the growth that the state is looking to do from an economic development standpoint, and as we have done for many years here aligns with the policy of the state and that's going to enable us to continue to excel. So I think there is some upside. None of that is in our plan. None of it has been in our plan, and we're just going to keep our options open."", 'Constantine Lednev', ""Okay. And any particular time frame that you're looking at or now ongoing?"", 'Ralph A. LaRossa', ""No. No. I think once we get a couple of years out here, we'll be able to see how is the ZECs are still in place through '25 and as all the companies are talking about ad nauseam, the PTC rules need to come out. And once all of that comes together, we'll be able to look at a plan to optimize the revenues from those plants."", 'Constantine Lednev', 'Okay. Perfect. And maybe shifting to PSE&G for a little bit. Do you have any thoughts around any lessons learned around recent rate proceedings in the state? And just how are you thinking in terms of update filings through the process and maybe the activity around settlement negotiations like any deal breakers or settlement like ROE or anything else?', 'Ralph A. LaRossa', ""Yes. Constantine, I think the biggest lesson learned is that New Jersey has its act together. I really think that the state -- if you look at what has happened recently with JCP&L and Atlantic City Electric, really good outcomes. And I wouldn't say everybody is always -- people are always looking for a little more here or there. But the process and the methodology that's been used has been consistent within the past. There hasn't been any real deviations and we don't expect there to be anything different with our case. Going in with a case that's not as big as some others have gone in with. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, if you look at Page 12 in the deck, we've done really well by our customers over a time period that has seen a lot of inflation. We're really not anticipating this to be a very contentious case."", 'Operator', 'The next question is from the line of David Arcaro with Morgan Stanley.', 'David Keith Arcaro', ""Ralph, I think in the past, you've thought that there could be some upside to the PJM load growth outlook in New Jersey, and we've obviously seen some of that get reflected in the latest load forecast. We've also seen some state initiatives pushing for AI and data centers. So I guess what are you seeing on the ground in terms of data center activity, any upside to latest load growth expectations?"", 'Ralph A. LaRossa', ""Yes. So a couple of pieces there, David. First of all, on the state level, we were very happy to see that PJM listened to our recommendations and most importantly, to the state's policy. And so they've reflected both of those things in their latest forecast. That being said, PJM is a lot bigger than the state of New Jersey. And so we're hoping that PJM takes a look across its entire footprint and make sure that the same methodologies are being used and a consistent methodology in all the states. States have different policies. So they may have different outcomes, electric vehicles being a great example. But how that -- how any of those loads are being looked at should be consistent, in our opinion, across the entire footprint of PJM. And then specifically in our backyard, we are starting to see some data centers pop up here. I'd say -- so far, what we've seen is somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 to 100 megawatts, but those conversations are just starting. Again, if you think about what the state has been pushing from an economic development standpoint, there's a lot of AI activities. The governor is trying to entice some companies to move into the area. Once that happens, there might be some more opportunities for us. And our system is really well positioned. We've talked for years about the build that we did on the transmission side and the self transmission upgrades that we've been doing. It's driving some less mile investments for us, but that's also, again, consistent with what we've talked about with you all in the past."", 'Daniel J. Cregg', ""Yes. And David, just a reminder, we do have the Conservation Incentive Program that's in place. And so what this matters more from our perspective, it's less about the particular road growth and the volumes that we would sell. It's much more about the infrastructure needs to have these folks be able to set up shop here in New Jersey."", 'Ralph A. LaRossa', ""Yes. And the only -- think about it this way, too, David, is if Dan is putting in a data center, he's going to use 100 megawatts, that's 100 megawatts more to spread the costs over for all the customers. So it also creates more headroom for our residential customers. So all bits of it come together in a positive way."", 'David Keith Arcaro', ""Yes, that's helpful. Got it. And am I hearing you correctly that I'm wondering about the potential T&D CapEx opportunity that could stem from this so far. Are you thinking it's kind of within the programs that you're -- that you're growing already. wondering if there's potential incremental upside if this becomes a bigger driver?"", 'Ralph A. LaRossa', ""Yes, we would certainly signal that to you if we did. But I think what Dan and Carlotta and I've been saying wherever we've been going has been, right now, we've got our last mile investments that we need to make. And then if you look at our CapEx bar charts, we have a few -- a little bit of upside that's built into the high and the low, but there's nothing that I would say is incrementally driving us above those charts that we've provided in the past."", 'David Keith Arcaro', ""Yes. Okay. Got it. Then I was just wondering, as we think about affordability in the state, I was wondering if you could run through just the elements of rate headroom that you see looking forward, things that fall off of the rate plan, I'm thinking storms, ZECs, et cetera, just to put the rate case increase into perspective."", 'Ralph A. LaRossa', ""Yes, David, I'm going to let Dan walk you through that, but -- because there's a lot of puts and takes that we've been taking people through, but start with Page 12 and take it from there."", 'Daniel J. Cregg', ""Ralph tees it up exactly right. I think, rates -- I tend to not think about it as headroom as available dollars. I just try to think about it as maintaining an affordable bill for the for the state of New Jersey. And if you take a look at Page 12, it shows that we have done a very good job of doing exactly that over the last 5 years. And this is on a relative scale, but I think we've been able to manage the system very well at an affordable rate. And also with the reliability that Ralph talked about in his prepared remarks and also the customers sat studies talked about within those remarks. You do mention something that I think is important as well. If we take a look at the ZECs that will roll off in May of 2025, you'll see a couple of hundred million dollars that will come off of PSEG customers and closer to $300 million across the state. So that is I think, a benefit from an affordability perspective to the extent that there's capital that's needed for the reliability of the system and some of the energy transition that can help in that regard. But we don't really think about it as headroom, we think about just trying to maintain as affordable bills we can while we're still providing quality service to customers."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Durgesh Chopra with Evercore ISI.', 'Durgesh Chopra', ""Just on the $3.1 billion energy efficiency filing, maybe can you just clarify, is that the spending, is that over a 6-year period? Or is that from '25 to '27, that's part one. And then part two, when should we expect a decision from the commission on that?"", 'Ralph A. LaRossa', ""Yes. So great questions, Durgesh. And it can be a little confusing because they do talk about the period as a triennial period. And so that '25 to '27, it's actually 2.5 years, which is the reason for some of the extensions that you've seen that we remarked upon earlier in our prepared remarks. Think about that 3-year period as being the period during which you're going to get the commitments to actually have the work get done. But we have described for folks, and it's important given the magnitude of the numbers, that it's understood that the actual spending to satisfy those commitments is going to be done closer to a 5- to 6-year period. So I think that's how to think about it. It is described as a triennial period. but that's more about getting the commitments. The spend will be over a little bit longer period. And the schedule that's in place right now is for us to move forward. We made that filing, if you recall, December 1. We did that at the same time as all the utilities in the state. And you should see in the third quarter to fourth quarter. I think it's October of this year coming up is the estimated date for us to get an outcome there."", 'Durgesh Chopra', 'Got it. And that process is separate and independent from the rate case, right? Just to be clear.', 'Ralph A. LaRossa', 'Yes, that is correct. That is correct.', 'Durgesh Chopra', 'Okay. Perfect. And then can I just quickly follow up, Dan, just later thoughts and your discussions on the nuclear PTC and where do we stand on getting guidance in terms of timeline and what to expect there?', 'Daniel J. Cregg', ""Yes, we're still in a waiting game, I guess. I wish I had a different answer for you. Treasury, as we have spoken to them last, which is just a couple of months ago, we made them aware as we do every time that we can that it's important for them to try to get the rules out sooner rather than later. But as we sit here today, they have not issued a date by which that they will provide that guidance. So we are just awaiting their answer. I don't have anything more specific. I wish I did."", 'Operator', 'Our next question comes from the line of Carly Davenport with Goldman Sachs.', 'Carly S. Davenport', ""Maybe just to quickly follow up under Durgesh's question there. As we think about the interim before we get the PTC guidance, how should we think about the hedge program in the meantime? Should we expect to see any potential incremental '24 hedges or starting to layer in '25 hedges between now and then?"", 'Daniel J. Cregg', ""Yes. Carly, so we've provided some data with respect to where 2024 is. And we do have some hedges out for '25, obviously, at this juncture. I mean, it is a little bit more challenging when you don't know exactly how they're going to come out with that definition of gross receipts. And so what we've tried to do internally is just take a look at what some of the potential most logical outcomes could be and try to triangulate off of that to try to basically do exactly what we've always done is try to minimize the overall risk inherent with that business. And so if under different scenarios, you could see a moderation of risk by moderating our hedges a little bit, that's basically what we're going to try to do. Again, the objective of being identical to where it has been in the past to minimize the overall risk. And if there's a little bit of a different hedge position we might want to put on to do that, that's what we would end up doing."", 'Carly S. Davenport', ""Got it. Okay. That's really helpful. And then maybe just as you think about managing O&M, can you just talk about some of the moving pieces we should be keeping in mind for 2024. I know that there might be some upward pressure from some of the nuclear outages that you have, but anything that you'd flag on O&M for '24?"", 'Ralph A. LaRossa', ""Yes. No, there's nothing really. Just a reminder, though, for everyone, we really have that great outcome that we had with our union negotiations where we have labor certainty starting last May, and continuing where we had -- we negotiated a 4-year deal with our unions at 4% increase than 3%, 3% and 3% in the subsequent years. So there's no surprises that we see on the horizon from that aspect and there's a lot of talk certainly about fuel prices on the nuclear side, which we can give you some more about if you're interested. But it's such a small percentage of the overall O&M that we have that it's really -- it doesn't become a material conversation for us at this point. So we don't really see anything that's coming at us, there's always storms and its other activities, but nothing that we specifically are concerned about."", 'Daniel J. Cregg', ""And even just to follow on Ralph's comments for '24 of the nuclear fuel comment, most of what we will incur for 2024 is what's in the reactor already. And so as we do step through time, you've seen some increment in those markets. But for 2024, you shouldn't expect anything very different."", 'Operator', 'Our next question is from the line of Ryan Levine with Citi.', 'Ryan Michael Levine', 'One follow-up on nuclear. Should we expect that there is a plan in place on what you would do once you get the treasury regulation around tax policy that you could roll out shortly thereafter or is there a more delayed timeline in terms of response that we should look for?', 'Ralph A. LaRossa', ""Yes. Ryan, I can't say enough about Dan and his team as far as how much they've done as far as looking at a bunch of different options right now. So I think we're very well positioned to act when we need to act and they've been very thoughtful about that. But I'll give it to Dan to give you any more specifics."", 'Daniel J. Cregg', ""Yes. I mean, I think, Ralph said it, we've done a lot of work trying to understand where this could come out. I guess I would say the treasury has given us the time to do that work by not having some guidance out as early as we might have liked. So -- in those situations, what you do is you try to think about where they may come out with guidance and to prepare yourself to be ready for any of those outcomes. And so that's what we've been doing. To your -- the other part of your question, yes, we would let you know what our response will be after it does come out, we're able to thoroughly read through everything and make sure that we understand all the nuances that may or may not be in what comes out. I hope when it does come out, it will be a one and done, instead of guidance that will have incremental guidance to follow, it would be great if it was if it comes out in full form, but we will definitely share how we're approaching things once we know what the final rules are."", 'Ryan Michael Levine', 'Great. And unrelated, I think you were touching on time of use rates as being important for the data center potential opportunity in New Jersey. Is that -- am I hearing that right? And is there any rate design mechanisms that are being discussed to maybe further attract that industry development in the state?', 'Daniel J. Cregg', ""Yes. So maybe a little bit less from a data center perspective, but certainly from a broader perspective, if you think about EVs, one of the things that we did touch on was that time of use rates is a topic that we would anticipate that we'd work through within this rate case. And I think in Ralph's prepared remarks, he talked about that being helpful to those that ultimately have EVs and could encourage some incremental adoption there. But that's more where you would find it in the rate case and less about data centers, more about electrification and EV."", 'Ralph A. LaRossa', ""We're just really well positioned, Ryan, between the CIP that we've had in place for some time and where we are from a rate structure standpoint that Dan's comments are dead on."", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) There are no further questions at this time. And I would like to turn the floor back to Mr. LaRossa for closing comments.', 'Ralph A. LaRossa', ""Great. Thanks. .Listen, this -- I think the fact that we've got -- we only have 5 questions on this call, folks asking questions that at the end of the day, it was another uneventful call for us. And that is just really what we're hoping to put in place is we've worked really hard as a team to close out our first full year together. 2023 was a year of execution that came across from a number of different areas in our company. But it's all built on the base of a utility that's really uniquely positioned. It's got -- it's in -- it's provided affordable service for its customers, it's provided reliable service for its customers and it's continued to deliver high-quality service based upon the results of all the polling that we do with our customers and J.D. Power just being one of those examples. And then you combine that with a nuclear fleet now has continued to be more predictable, not only because of what we're seeing from the revenue side and the PTCs, but from an operating standpoint, you see in our deck, we went from 92% capacity factored and 93% capacity factor this year, and we'll continue to improve on that. That's our expectation. We want to continue to provide that great revenues from those plants that's going to provide us with the opportunity to continue to not issue equity, and not sell any assets and continue the growth that we've had on the utility side. So we thank you for all the support that you've given us over 2023, and you can expect from us the same consistent and uneventful progress that we've made throughout this past year. So thanks, and have a great day."", 'Operator', ""Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.""]"

GuruFocus has detected 8 Warning Signs with PEG.', ""Public Service Enterprise Group Inc (NYSE:PEG), a leading energy company, has recently filed its 10-K report on February 26, 2024. This SWOT analysis aims to provide investors with a comprehensive view of the company's internal and external factors that could impact its performance. PEG operates a regulated utility, PSE&G, serving 4.2 million customers in New Jersey and also manages the Long Island Power Authority system. Following the sale of its mid-Atlantic, New York, and Northeast gas and oil power plants in 2022, PEG's focus has shifted towards regulated utility services and clean energy projects. The company's financial health, as reflected in the financial statements, shows a solid foundation with a market capitalization of $31,072.4 million as of June 30, 2023, and a commitment to safety, integrity, and customer service as core aspects of its operations."", ""Regulatory Framework and Investment in Infrastructure: PEG's strength lies in its well-established regulatory framework, which has enabled the company to secure favorable rates for its transmission and distribution services. The company's transmission revenues are not impacted by sales volumes, providing a stable revenue stream. PEG's investment in infrastructure, particularly in clean energy projects such as energy efficiency (EE), electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure, and renewable energy, positions it well for future growth. The company's current approved distribution base rates provide for a return on equity (ROE) of 9.6%, indicating a strong financial position."", ""Strategic Divestitures and Operational Efficiency: PEG's strategic divestiture of its fossil generation portfolio aligns with its long-term vision of focusing on regulated utility services and clean energy. This move not only streamlines operations but also reduces exposure to volatile commodity markets. The company's operational efficiency is further enhanced by its role as a transmission owner in PJM Interconnection, ensuring reliable service to a densely populated and industrialized region."", ""Dependence on Regulatory Approvals: PEG's performance is heavily reliant on regulatory approvals for rate cases and investment programs. Any adverse regulatory developments could impact the company's ability to recover costs and earn a reasonable return on its investments. The necessity to file rate cases, such as the one in December 2023, introduces uncertainty and could affect financial stability if outcomes are not favorable."", 'Challenges in Workforce Management: While PEG has a strong commitment to human capital management, the company faces challenges in maintaining a skilled workforce in a rapidly evolving energy sector. Over 60% of the workforce is represented by unions, and while recent negotiations have been successful, there is always a risk of labor disputes that could disrupt operations.', ""Growth in Clean Energy and Technology: PEG has the opportunity to capitalize on the growing demand for clean energy and technology advancements. Investments in EE, EV infrastructure, and renewable energy projects align with shifting consumer preferences and regulatory trends towards sustainability. The company's proactive approach in these areas could lead to increased market share and customer loyalty."", ""Expansion of Services and Customer Base: With a modest increase in its customer base since 2019, PEG has the opportunity to expand its services and reach. The company's competitive services, such as appliance repair, offer additional revenue streams within its service territory. Furthermore, the transition to a more electrified economy presents new business opportunities for PEG."", ""Severe Weather Events and Climate Change: PEG is susceptible to severe weather events and the impacts of climate change, which could damage infrastructure and disrupt services. The cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable, and the inability to restore power promptly could damage the company's reputation. Additionally, climate change poses transition risks, including potential legislative and regulatory burdens."", ""Cybersecurity and Competitive Pressures: Cybersecurity attacks pose a significant threat to PEG's ability to provide safe and reliable service. The company must continuously invest in cybersecurity measures to mitigate this risk. Moreover, PEG faces competitive pressures from new market entrants and technological advances that could affect its market position and pricing."", ""In conclusion, Public Service Enterprise Group Inc (NYSE:PEG) exhibits a strong regulatory framework and strategic focus on clean energy, which are key strengths. However, the company must navigate regulatory uncertainties and workforce challenges. Opportunities in clean energy and service expansion are promising, but threats from severe weather, cybersecurity risks, and competition loom. PEG's ability to leverage its strengths while effectively managing its weaknesses and threats will be crucial for its continued success in the dynamic energy market."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

Most utilities are monopolies or duopolies in their geographies and are able to raise prices in lockstep with cost inflation, albeit in a regulated fashion.', ""But the worst environment for utilities might be one in which interest rates rise and there's no recession, because most utilities can't increase prices more than regulators allow."", ""That's what the surprisingly strong U.S. economy has done over the past 18 months or so. As a result, the utility sector has plunged about 21% off its all-time highs reached in late 2022 -- when other economically sensitive sectors were bottoming."", ""But with utilities now out of favor, now may be a good time to pick up some best-in-class names, like NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE). Prior to the downturn in utilities, NextEra was hailed as one of the best of the sector. It's the largest U.S. utility in the fast-growing state of Florida, with an additional renewable power development arm that could sell projects down to its associated yieldco NextEra Energy Partners (NYSE: NEP)."", 'That gave NextEra a premium value prior to the sector downturn, unfortunately setting NextEra up for an even bigger 40% fall off its highs.', ""NextEra took an especially big leg down when NextEra Partners lowered its annual target dividend growth to about 6%, or half its prior target rate, in September 2023. The reduction was due to higher interest rates, which curtail the amount the company can grow given the same amount of risk. That sent NextEra's and NextEra Partners' stocks plummeting."", 'However, with that decline now in the past, NextEra Energy trades at a quite reasonable 15.7 times earnings, along with a healthy 3.63% dividend yield. Meanwhile, NextEra has continued to execute, beating revenue and profit expectations last quarter. It deployed another 1,200 megawatts of solar and began commercial operations at its clean hydrogen pilot project at the Okeechobee Clean Energy Center. Management also forecast about 10% dividend growth in 2024 and between 6% and 8% growth in 2025 and 2026.', ""The Federal Reserve has indicated that it's likely done raising interest rates this cycle. So who knows? If rates drop more than people think from here, it's possible management could raise growth expectations just as it lowered them in a rising-rate environment. And for those who want to guard against recession, NextEra looks like a solid recession-proof stock now at a low valuation."", ""The oil and gas sector went from very in-favor in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine to very out-of-favor, with moderating oil prices and plunging natural gas prices last year. But times like these may be the best time to buy into this cyclical sector."", 'French oil and gas giant TotalEnergies (NYSE: TTE) trades much more cheaply than its U.S. counterparts. This is despite having a relatively similar business model spanning upstream, midstream, and downstream oil and gas operations, liquified natural gas facilities, and a burgeoning renewable energy power portfolio. TotalEnergies has been very serious about tapping low-cost and low-carbon sources of oil and gas and investing in renewables, while divesting reserves in higher-carbon sources such as the Canadian oil sands.', ""While TotalEnergies' adjusted earnings plunged 36% to $21.4 billion in 2023, off the banner $36.4 billion earned in 2022, the stock only trades at a $150 billion market cap, a measly 7.4 times those low 2023 earnings figures. And TotalEnergies has just $6.3 billion in net debt -- practically nothing for a company its size."", ""The bargain-basement valuation has left TotalEnergies with a 5% dividend yield, while also leaving room for significant share repurchases. Not only that, but TotalEnergies' profitability has also given it the ability to invest in future growth. It achieved a 141% reserve replacement ratio in 2023, along with investments in its growing renewable power business, including within the U.S."", ""TotalEnergies forecasts another 6.8% dividend increase in 2024 after a 7.1% increase in 2023, with at least $2 billion in repurchases per quarter. At this valuation, that would decrease Total's share count by another 5.3%."", ""If you're looking for a great combination of a high dividend yield, repurchases, and growth, don't let this top European value stock pass you buy."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in NextEra Energy right now?', 'Before you buy stock in NextEra Energy, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and NextEra Energy wasn’t one of them.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the clean energy industry, head directly to 5 Best Green Stocks To Invest In 2024.', 'In 2023, the solar energy market saw positive growth, while the wind energy sector faced significant challenges. Wind energy projects struggled with rising costs for materials, labor, and capital, as well as delays in interconnection, permits, and transmission. However, there was some relief in the supply chain as new clean energy and climate laws came into effect. Federal investments in clean energy and increasing demand for decarbonization from both public and private sectors are driving forces for renewables. These factors are expected to help renewables overcome obstacles in 2024 to meet climate targets, as per Deloitte. 2024 is expected to see varying speeds of growth across renewable technologies, industries, and markets. The Energy Information Administration predicts a 17% growth in renewable deployment, reaching 42 gigawatts in 2024, which would account for nearly a quarter of electricity generation.', 'According to S&P Global Commodity Insights, investments in clean energy technology are projected to reach nearly $800 billion in 2024, a 10% to 20% increase from 2023. Solar energy is expected to receive the largest share of this investment, accounting for around 55% of the total. Onshore wind will see significant investment as well, although at a slower growth rate. The fastest-growing sectors are anticipated to be battery energy storage and electrolysis.\xa0', 'Despite increasing costs for offshore wind and hydrogen energy, decreasing raw material prices are likely to lead to a continued decline in the average cost of clean energy technologies in 2024. Solar and battery costs have already dropped significantly since 2022 and are expected to fall below 2020 levels in 2024. While solar and battery manufacturers have enjoyed healthy margins, they are expected to face lower margins in the coming years. Downstream players, such as distributors and installers, may face challenges due to high inventories and declining prices. The oversupply and decreasing raw material prices in solar modules and batteries led to a price war in the second half of 2023, with further market consolidation expected in 2024. The global wind turbine supply market is historically divided between Chinese manufacturers serving the domestic market and Western firms catering to the rest of the world.\xa0', ""On a more positive note, one of the key commitments from COP28 is to triple global renewables capacity by 2030 to 11 terawatts. This initiative aims to reduce the reliance on fossil fuels in global energy production. The pledge is part of a broader effort to decarbonize the energy sector, which is responsible for about three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions. Sultan al-Jaber, the United Arab Emirates' COP28 summit President, said:"", '""This can and will help transition the world away from unabated coal.""', ""Led by the European Union, the United States, and the United Arab Emirates, the pledge also includes plans to expand nuclear power, reduce methane emissions, and limit private finance for coal power. The goal of tripling renewable energy capacity is to eliminate CO2-emitting fossil fuels from the world's energy system by 2050 at the latest."", 'In this article, we discuss the best green stocks to invest in 2024, including General Electric Company (NYSE:GE), NextEra Energy, Inc.

As this spending ramps up, we expect Fluence’s revenues to grow well above 20% over the next several years and allow the business to scale profitably. Based on the IPO price, Fluence was valued at roughly 2x forward revenues and less than market multiples on cash flow and earnings by mid-decade in our base case scenario.

That means it would need $3,800 million of sales to generate that level of earnings ($380 mill ÷ 10%).', 'Since sales are now $920 million, they would have to rise by 4.1x in the next 10 years. That would require annual sales growth of 15.2%.', 'You see how neatly that all works: investors accept the company’s 10-year, 15% annual sales growth projections, and if a 10% net profit margin and a P/E of 25x earnings are reasonable, then the company will have a $9.5 billion market cap at that time. Except that is the current price. That means a 10-year return of zero.', 'In order to get a 10% annualized return from the stock, Sunrun would need to be priced at a P/E of 65x its earnings 10 years from now, if at a 10% net margin. Or it would have to have some combination of lower P/E and higher growth and/or higher profit margin.', 'In the meantime, this is Sunrun’s recent pattern of revenue growth and profitability (the company did recently increase its estimate of installed-capacity growth in 2021 from 20-25% to a new estimate of 25% to 30%).', 'For the time being, Sunrun loses an extraordinary amount of money, an amount that has been getting larger. Perhaps there are economies of scale that will manifest in the future, so that it will attain profitability. Perhaps from the roughly one-half of Sunrun’s revenues that are from long-term customer service agreements that run up to 25 years.

We added the name in January 2023 when the stock was trading at a below normal 15 times earnings. Our research identified an upside to earnings power from maturing hedges and regulatory changes, including the Inflation Reduction Act’s nuclear credit. A recent spinout from Exelon Corp, we viewed the strength of Constellation’s clean, reliable baseload power model as an appealing and high potential offering for residential and commercial customers.

Three examples are businesses with consistently growing dividend payments and a low payout ratio, steady share repurchases, and a high and rising return on invested capital. Finding companies that meet these requirements creates a ""stocked pond"" for us to fish in.', ""One business swimming around in this stocked pond is animal health specialist Zoetis (NYSE: ZTS). It's achieved a total return above 500% since its spin-off from Pfizer in 2013, but Zoetis has seen its share price struggle lately. It's now trading 23% below its all-time highs."", ""Despite this drop, the company's operations have been resilient. With the human-pet bond growing stronger every year -- and the need to maintain healthy livestock always essential -- Zoetis looks poised to set new all-time highs sooner rather than later."", ""With its medicines, vaccines, diagnostics, and medicated feed additives, Zoetis has over 300 product lines serving companion animals and livestock. It's home to 15 blockbuster drugs generating over $100 million in sales annually. The company operates through two business segments (with subsequent sales-by-species breakdowns):"", 'United States (53% of sales in 2023): Dogs and cats account for 73% of sales, with cattle adding 16%, horses 4%, poultry 4%, and swine rounding things out with 3%.', 'International (46%): Dogs and cats equal 49% of revenue, while the remainder comes from cattle (20%), swine (11%), poultry (9%), fish (6%), horses (3%), and sheep (2%).', ""Zoetis is a well-diversified powerhouse, holding the No. 1 market position in North America, Latin America, and Asia, alongside the No. 2 spot in Eastern and Western Europe. Despite this market share leadership, the company's growth story appears far from over."", 'Zoetis received the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its monoclonal antibody drugs to treat osteoarthritis (OA) in cats in 2022 and dogs in 2023. This is a significant step-change over giving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to pets. These new treatments could eliminate a lot of pain felt by our furry friends.', ""In the U.S., it is estimated that roughly 40% of dogs and cats show signs of OA, but most went without treatment before Zoetis' breakthrough, primarily due to the risks related to pets taking NSAIDs. Management believes these new drugs should grow to over $1 billion in annual sales at their peak, joining the company's dermatology and parasiticides offerings as $1 billion-per-year therapy areas."", ""On top of this, Zoetis estimates that the renal, cardiology, and oncology markets for companion animals will triple in size by 2032, creating three additional growth avenues for the company's research and development team to explore."", 'Buoyed by its leadership advantage and long list of patent-protected drugs, Zoetis has achieved top-tier profitability metrics. However, these figures are truly remarkable because they are still improving.', ""These steadily rising profitability metrics may indicate a widening moat for Zoetis, which appears to be expanding upon its leadership position in its market. Its return on invested capital (ROIC) is particularly noteworthy, as it highlights the company's ability to generate more net income from its debt and equity than most of its peers."", 'With its current ROIC of 20%, Zoetis ranks in the top quintile of the S&P 500. This is important to investors. Companies in this top 20% have historically outperformed their lower-ranked peers by a wide margin since 2002.', ""The company's tremendous net profit margin of 27% arms management with a stockpile of profits to return to shareholders -- and it has a long history of doing so.

With Zoetis quintupling its dividend over the last decade yet only using 31% of its net income to fund these payments, the company should remain a dividend grower for a long time."", ""Zoetis' stock is trading at 34 times next year's earnings, so investors should be aware that it isn't traditionally cheap. However, thanks to its three market-beating indicators and a leadership position in an industry that should only become more important with time, Zoetis makes for a perfect dollar-cost averaging opportunity."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Zoetis right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Zoetis, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Zoetis wasn’t one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of ESG investing and its prospects, and go directly to read 5 Best Environmental Dividend Stocks To Invest In According To Analysts.\xa0', 'Sustainable investing, increasingly gaining traction among investors, represents a pivotal shift in financial markets towards aligning profit motives with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations. A growing number of individuals are becoming attracted to ESG investments for a variety of reasons, ranging from ethical concerns to sound financial decision-making. As per research conducted by deVere Group, over 800 clients revealed that more than half (56%) of investors expressed their intentions to boost their investments in ESG funds in 2024.', 'Despite the increasing popularity of ESG investing, the year 2023 did not fare well for such investment strategies. Investors persisted in withdrawing their investments from sustainable funds during the fourth quarter of 2023. U.S. sustainable funds experienced their initial year of outflows since records began over a decade ago, marking 2023 as their most challenging year to date, according to a report by Morningstar. In the fourth quarter alone, investors withdrew $5 billion from U.S. sustainable funds, contributing to a total outflow of $13 billion throughout the year. This trend was attributed to underperformance, ongoing political scrutiny in the US, and a challenging year for an iShares fund. Moreover, by the end of 2023, the total assets invested in sustainable funds reached $323 billion. This figure indicates a drop of approximately 12% from the previous record high recorded at the end of 2021. However, it also signifies an 18% increase from the lowest point observed in the third quarter of 2022. In contrast, assets within the broader U.S. funds market reached their peak at the end of 2021 but experienced a decline of 5% by the end of 2023.', 'That said, analysts are optimistic about the potential of ESG investing in the foreseeable future. Based on a study conducted by Bloomberg Intelligence, global ESG assets are projected to surpass $53 trillion by 2025, constituting more than a third of the estimated total assets under management of $140.5 trillion. The convergence of factors including the pandemic and the green recovery initiatives in major economies such as the U.S., EU, and China is expected to demonstrate the efficacy of ESG in evaluating a fresh array of financial risks and leveraging capital markets.', 'As discussed previously, there is a growing trend among investors towards ESG investing, primarily due to the reputation of these assets for delivering consistent returns. Contrary to concerns regarding potential conflicts between financial gains and ESG principles, a survey conducted by PwC revealed that nine out of ten asset managers believe that incorporating ESG criteria into their investment approach will enhance overall returns. Moreover, a majority of institutional investors, accounting for 60%, reported experiencing higher performance yields from ESG investments compared to non-ESG alternatives. The survey also noted that investors are willing to pay for ESG performance, as they anticipate the potential for higher returns. Specifically, three-quarters of those surveyed, constituting 78%, expressed their readiness to pay elevated fees for ESG funds.', 'American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), AT&T Inc.

If you want to skip and jump directly to the top countries on our list, you can go to 5 countries with declining birth rates in 2024.', 'The global birth rate issue is a critical concern impacting countries worldwide. Over the past 70 years, there has been a significant decrease in birth rates across the nations. This trend is particularly evident in countries like China and South Korea, where birth rates have plummeted by over 80% since 1950. The decline in birth rates is a complex phenomenon with both positive and negative implications.', 'On the positive side, it signifies progress in socio-economic development. As countries advance and living standards improve, societal norms shift towards prioritizing education, career, and personal goals over starting families. This shift is empowered by factors such as enhanced opportunities for women, urbanization, and access to family planning services.', 'However, the downside of declining birth rates cannot be ignored. One of the significant consequences is the rapidly aging population. With fewer children being born, the proportion of elderly individuals increases, straining social welfare systems, healthcare, and pension schemes. Additionally, a shrinking workforce due to declining birth rates may lead to labor shortages, skill gaps, and reduced economic productivity. It is evident that declining birth rates have far-reaching implications, impacting not only demographics but also the labor market and global economy. Urgent action and strategic planning are needed to address these challenges and ensure sustainable development in the face of a changing population landscape.', 'By the end of this century, a worrying trend of declining populations may affect nearly every country worldwide. While advancements in healthcare and reduced poverty levels have resulted in increased life spans, the number of births per woman has significantly decreased. In the last five decades, the global fertility rate has dwindled by half to 2.3. In advanced economies, this rate falls below the critical replacement level of 2.1, necessary for population maintenance across generations. Developing nations are also witnessing a parallel decline in fertility rates. Immediate attention and action are imperative to understand and mitigate the implications of this demographic shift.', 'On the other hand, in the United States, the birth rate has been steadily declining since the onset of the Great Recession, plunging by nearly 23% from 2007 to 2022. Presently, the typical American woman gives birth to approximately 1.6 children, a stark drop from the three children per woman in 1950 and well below the crucial ""replacement rate"" of 2.1 children required to maintain a stable population. Immediate attention is essential to grasp the implications of this concerning demographic shift.', 'Let’s now look at some of the companies which are keeping their eyes on the birth rate trend globally, and adjusting their operations accordingly.

Organic sales, which exclude the impacts of foreign exchange and acquisitions/divestitures, saw a more significant surge of 4%. Despite a dip in diluted net earnings per share to $1.40, a 12% decrease from the prior year, attributed primarily to a non-cash impairment of the Gillette intangible asset, core net earnings per share surged to $1.84, marking a notable 16% increase compared to the previous year.', 'Freer/Shutterstock.com', 'To come up with the list of 15 countries with declining birth rates in 2024, we referred to The World Factbook list of countries with their birth rates – comparison of the average annual number of births of countries in a year per 1,000 persons in the population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks in the S&P 500 and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks To Invest In 2024.\xa0', 'In 2023, despite the presence of higher interest rates, consumers remained unfazed, and investors displayed more optimism than apprehension, largely fueled by the excitement surrounding advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Consequently, the S&P 500 experienced a remarkable surge, gaining over 24% last year. This surge was primarily attributed to the dominance of what has been dubbed the ""Magnificent Seven."" These seven major companies, which include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), played a pivotal role in driving the S&P 500\'s performance, contributing significantly to its overall returns. On the flip side, a staggering 72% of stocks failed to match the performance of the S&P 500 index, setting a new record for underperformance. Additionally, dividend-paying stocks experienced a downturn in 2023, paving the way for the dominance of technology equities. Despite this, the stock market returns throughout the year were both exceptional and notably robust in comparison to historical trends.', 'Despite their recent lackluster performance, dividends remain a crucial aspect of returns for equity investors and have garnered considerable attention in capital markets research. The appeal of dividend-paying stocks is substantial, and rightfully so as they have the potential to significantly enhance long-term investment outcomes. This general observation has been well-documented across various periods and global markets. For instance, one study analyzed the components contributing to total equity returns of U.S. stocks spanning from 1802 to 2002. It revealed that dividends, along with real growth in dividends, constituted a substantial portion, accounting for 5.8% of the total annualized return of 7.9% over 200 years. Another study, conducted from a global perspective by researchers at the London Business School, examined data from 1900 to 2005 across 17 countries. It found that the real return averaged around 5%, with an average dividend yield of 4.5% during that timeframe. These findings provide compelling evidence for the significance of dividends for long-term investors.', ""Yet another report from S&P Dow Jones Indices provided insight into the enduring impact of dividend-paying equities over the long term. This report emphasized that since 1926, dividends have played a significant role, contributing roughly 32% of the total return for the S&P 500, with capital appreciations making up the remaining 68%. Hence, both sustainable dividend income and the potential for capital appreciation are key considerations for forming expectations regarding total returns. Furthermore, the growth of dividends proves to be beneficial for investors. Over an extended period, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which monitors the performance of companies with 25 or more consecutive years of dividend growth, has surpassed the S&P 500 index while exhibiting lower volatility, indicating higher risk-adjusted returns. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats' ability to mitigate losses can be observed through its upside and downside capture ratios. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, it has outperformed the S&P 500 in down months 69.34% of the time and in up months 43.61% of the time from December 29, 1989, to July 31, 2023. Additionally, it's worth noting that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats experienced lower drawdown levels compared to the benchmark index."", ""Considering these points, let's explore some of the top S&P 500 dividend-paying stocks."", 'Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay', 'Our Methodology: ', 'To create this list, we first examined the S&P 500 stocks based on their weight in the index and picked the top 25 stocks that consistently distribute dividends to their shareholders.

The dividend has gone from an annual total of $1.00 in 2014 to the most recent total annual payment of $0.84. Doing the maths, this is a decline of about 1.7% per year. Declining dividends isn't generally what we look for as they can indicate that the company is running into some challenges."", ""With a relatively unstable dividend, it's even more important to evaluate if earnings per share is growing, which could point to a growing dividend in the future. We are encouraged to see that Mosaic has grown earnings per share at 24% per year over the past five years.

A growing number of individuals are becoming attracted to ESG investments for a variety of reasons, ranging from ethical concerns to sound financial decision-making. As per research conducted by deVere Group, over 800 clients revealed that more than half (56%) of investors expressed their intentions to boost their investments in ESG funds in 2024.', 'Despite the increasing popularity of ESG investing, the year 2023 did not fare well for such investment strategies. Investors persisted in withdrawing their investments from sustainable funds during the fourth quarter of 2023. U.S. sustainable funds experienced their initial year of outflows since records began over a decade ago, marking 2023 as their most challenging year to date, according to a report by Morningstar. In the fourth quarter alone, investors withdrew $5 billion from U.S. sustainable funds, contributing to a total outflow of $13 billion throughout the year. This trend was attributed to underperformance, ongoing political scrutiny in the US, and a challenging year for an iShares fund. Moreover, by the end of 2023, the total assets invested in sustainable funds reached $323 billion. This figure indicates a drop of approximately 12% from the previous record high recorded at the end of 2021. However, it also signifies an 18% increase from the lowest point observed in the third quarter of 2022. In contrast, assets within the broader U.S. funds market reached their peak at the end of 2021 but experienced a decline of 5% by the end of 2023.', 'That said, analysts are optimistic about the potential of ESG investing in the foreseeable future. Based on a study conducted by Bloomberg Intelligence, global ESG assets are projected to surpass $53 trillion by 2025, constituting more than a third of the estimated total assets under management of $140.5 trillion. The convergence of factors including the pandemic and the green recovery initiatives in major economies such as the U.S., EU, and China is expected to demonstrate the efficacy of ESG in evaluating a fresh array of financial risks and leveraging capital markets.', 'As discussed previously, there is a growing trend among investors towards ESG investing, primarily due to the reputation of these assets for delivering consistent returns. Contrary to concerns regarding potential conflicts between financial gains and ESG principles, a survey conducted by PwC revealed that nine out of ten asset managers believe that incorporating ESG criteria into their investment approach will enhance overall returns. Moreover, a majority of institutional investors, accounting for 60%, reported experiencing higher performance yields from ESG investments compared to non-ESG alternatives. The survey also noted that investors are willing to pay for ESG performance, as they anticipate the potential for higher returns. Specifically, three-quarters of those surveyed, constituting 78%, expressed their readiness to pay elevated fees for ESG funds.', 'American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), AT&T Inc.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer cyclical sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Invest In.\xa0', 'Consumer cyclical companies produce goods and services that are considered non-essential or discretionary, meaning consumers are more likely to purchase them when they have extra income or feel confident about their financial situation. Consumer cyclical stocks include companies in sectors such as retail, automotive, travel and leisure, entertainment, and luxury goods.', ""Over the past year, we've seen clear evidence that consumers have remained strong despite challenges like high inflation, increasing interest rates, and greater recession concerns. This resilience notably buoyed the performance of stocks within the consumer discretionary sector, which includes businesses offering non-essential products and services such as apparel, automobiles, and accommodations. The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index ended 2023 with a total return of 42.41%, reporting one of its best years on record. In addition to the support from a strong consumer base, the stocks in this sector also gained from broader market trends that propelled the overall stock market higher in 2023. These trends included relief as the Federal Reserve signaled the potential end of its rate-hiking cycle as the year progressed. Furthermore, sector-level performance was boosted by specific issues affecting some of the largest companies within it. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), the two largest companies in the sector by a significant margin, have both seen remarkable gains in the past year, driven by the surge in mega-cap, tech-related stocks. Additionally, both companies are considered potential investment opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence."", ""After experiencing robust performance in 2023, analysts are also showing a preference for the sector in the current year. Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, stated that consumers' willingness to sustain moderate spending growth has been crucial for the economy. He suggested that this could be attributed, at least in part, to the robust labor market and notable wage increases. Based on a Fidelity report, the performance of sectors is expected to be influenced by broader economic factors in 2024. If inflation remains low and the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates, it could be advantageous for the sector, as consumers may be more inclined to buy expensive items like cars or homes. An even more positive scenario would be if the economy avoids a recession and job markets stay robust, which would particularly benefit this sector."", ""The report highlighted that following the sector's strong performance in 2023, stock valuations are not as low as they were previously. However, there are still segments of the market where the firm has identified robust long-term growth prospects, and where stocks are trading at attractive prices. One ongoing area of opportunity includes certain retailers. These companies possess defensive characteristics within their business models, offering some protection in case of a deteriorating economic outlook."", 'Another factor contributing to the positive outlook for the sector is that certain companies within it opt to distribute dividends when they maintain a steady cash flow and have a track record of sharing profits with shareholders.

A growing number of individuals are becoming attracted to ESG investments for a variety of reasons, ranging from ethical concerns to sound financial decision-making. As per research conducted by deVere Group, over 800 clients revealed that more than half (56%) of investors expressed their intentions to boost their investments in ESG funds in 2024.', 'Despite the increasing popularity of ESG investing, the year 2023 did not fare well for such investment strategies. Investors persisted in withdrawing their investments from sustainable funds during the fourth quarter of 2023. U.S. sustainable funds experienced their initial year of outflows since records began over a decade ago, marking 2023 as their most challenging year to date, according to a report by Morningstar. In the fourth quarter alone, investors withdrew $5 billion from U.S. sustainable funds, contributing to a total outflow of $13 billion throughout the year. This trend was attributed to underperformance, ongoing political scrutiny in the US, and a challenging year for an iShares fund. Moreover, by the end of 2023, the total assets invested in sustainable funds reached $323 billion. This figure indicates a drop of approximately 12% from the previous record high recorded at the end of 2021. However, it also signifies an 18% increase from the lowest point observed in the third quarter of 2022.

The convergence of factors including the pandemic and the green recovery initiatives in major economies such as the U.S., EU, and China is expected to demonstrate the efficacy of ESG in evaluating a fresh array of financial risks and leveraging capital markets.', 'As discussed previously, there is a growing trend among investors towards ESG investing, primarily due to the reputation of these assets for delivering consistent returns.

Moreover, a majority of institutional investors, accounting for 60%, reported experiencing higher performance yields from ESG investments compared to non-ESG alternatives. The survey also noted that investors are willing to pay for ESG performance, as they anticipate the potential for higher returns.

But then, China’s leading EV maker, came to the scene and turned Tesla’s world upside down. When it showed its new model back in 2007, BYD Company Limited (OTC: BYDDY) was a laughingstock. But, no one is laughing at BYD now who went far from being a battery manufacturer with a poor attempt of making a car to Tesla’s biggest threat. During the weekend, BYD even unveiled a super EV that promises to challenge even the luxurious Ferrari on the speed front.', 'A large part of BYD’s cars is in the lower price range, but BYD is also going for its part of the luxury market.\xa0Last year, BYD introduced its luxury brand\xa0Yangwang. Its super EV, the U9, will come from its luxury line.\xa0With a top speed of 309.19 kph, or 192.12 mph\xa0and the ability\xa0to accelerate to 100 kph within\xa0only\xa02.36 seconds, BYD’s newest EV is in line with long-established automakers such as Ferrari. However, Chinese EV makers have a significant advantage over their global rivals, the fact that China is the key market for\xa0a lithium iron phosphate\xa0production. These batteries are cheaper because they do not require expensive metals like cobalt.', 'BYD’s growth is unlike anything the automotive industry has seen in decades.', 'Last year, BYD made more than\xa03 million new-energy vehicles, made of 1.6 million battery-only cars and 1.4 million hybrids.\xa0But, BYD is now going for its piece of the luxury market while also expanding its global footprint beyond China. BYD does not sells its EVs and hybrids in the U.S. due to Trump era tariffs, which bodes well for Tesla, but it does sell buses. Even Tesla CEO admitted in January that if there were no trade barriers, the Chinese companies would pretty much demolish their rivals with their exported vehicles. However, Europe is another story. Last year, BYD announced it will build its first factory in Europe and the latest news suggest it will be in Hungary. Hungarian Prime Minister met with BYD’s leaders during the weekend to discuss this multi-billion investment that would be the greatest in the country’s history.\xa0\xa0Through subsidies, Beijing is strongly supporting Chinese companies to expand internationally in response to foreign trade restrictions.', 'However, legacy automaker General Motors is also re-entering Europe after its 2017 exit.

208,f5e48e33-4f14-3243-8dbc-ec98a8e3d15d,GM,2024-02-27,Pick These 4 Low P/CF Stocks to Spruce Up Your Portfolio,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pick-4-low-p-cf-124200760.html,1708951320,STORY,"['KBH', 'GM', 'ATGE', 'UNM']","[""Value investing is considered one of the best practices when it comes to picking stocks. It is essentially about selecting stocks that are fundamentally sound but have been beaten down by some external factors. Such stocks are poised to bounce back as and when investors recognize the inherent value of companies. Certainly, the value investment strategy best suits investors with a long-term horizon.There are different valuation metrics to determine a stock’s inherent strength. Still, a random selection of a ratio cannot serve your purpose if you want a realistic assessment of a company’s financial position. For this, the Price to Cash Flow (or P/CF) ratio is one of the key metrics. General Motors Company GM, Adtalem Global Education Inc. ATGE, Unum Group UNM and KB Home KBH boast a low P/CF ratio.This metric evaluates the market price of a stock relative to the amount of cash flow that the company is generating on a per-share basis – the lower the number, the better. One of the important factors that makes P/CF a highly dependable metric is that operating cash flow adds back non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization to net income, truly diagnosing a company's financial health.Analysts caution that a company’s earnings are subject to accounting estimates and management manipulation. However, cash flow is reliable. Net cash flow unveils how much money a company is actually generating and how effectively management is deploying the same.Positive cash flow indicates an increase in a company’s liquid assets. It gives the company the means to settle debt, meet its expenses, reinvest in its business, endure downturns and finally pay back its shareholders. Negative cash flow implies a decline in the company’s liquidity, which in turn lowers its flexibility to support these moves.However, solely based on the P/CF metric, an investment decision may not fetch the desired results. To identify stocks trading at a discount, you should expand your search criteria and consider the price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-sales ratio. Adding a favorable Zacks Rank and a Value Score of A or B to your search criteria should lead to even better results as these eliminate the chance of falling into a value trap.The Bargain Hunting StrategyHere are the parameters for selecting true value stocks:P/CF less than or equal to X-Industry Median.Price greater than or equal to 5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5 or higher.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that the stock is easily tradable.P/E using (F1) less than or equal to X-Industry Median: This parameter shortlists stocks that are trading at a discount or are equal to their peers.P/B less than or equal to X-Industry Median: A lower P/B compared with the industry average implies that there is enough room for the stock to gain.P/S less than or equal to X-Industry Median: The P/S ratio determines how a stock price compares to the company’s sales — the lower the ratio the more attractive the stock is.PEG less than 1: The ratio is used to determine a stock's value by taking the company's earnings growth into account. The PEG ratio gives a more complete picture than the P/E ratio. A value of less than 1 indicates that the stock is undervalued and that investors need to pay less for a stock that has robust earnings growth prospects.Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Value Score of less than or equal to B: Our research shows that stocks with a Style Score of A or B when combined with Zacks Rank #1 or 2 offer the best upside potential.Here are four of the nine stocks that qualified the screening:General Motors, which designs, builds, and sells cars, trucks, crossovers, and automobile parts globally, sports a Zacks Rank #1.

According to research from the US National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER), conducted over a span of nearly a decade, the growth of remote jobs varies significantly among English-speaking countries. The study, analyzing over 250 million job vacancies offering remote or hybrid work, highlights the pronounced rise of remote work in urban centers, particularly in cities like Washington, D.C., San Francisco, London, and Sydney. This trend is unsurprising, given the prevalence of white-collar jobs in these areas, which are more amenable to remote work arrangements.\xa0', ""Moreover, the research underscores the lasting impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on remote work adoption globally. While initial spikes were observed in countries with severe outbreaks, remote work has persisted as a popular choice beyond the pandemic's peak. Factors such as infrastructure and the prevalence of remote-capable industries significantly influence a city's remote work landscape. However, regional disparities persist, with southern cities in the U.S. exhibiting lower rates of remote job availability compared to their northeastern and western counterparts, owing to differences in industry composition and job demands."", 'In the quest for remote employment, the odds are increasingly stacked against applicants, particularly for lucrative positions.

Despite these hurdles, Walmart Inc (NYSE:WMT) is a viable option for those seeking remote employment, albeit with some caveats regarding physical presence expectations and relocation packages.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer cyclical sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Invest In.\xa0', 'Consumer cyclical companies produce goods and services that are considered non-essential or discretionary, meaning consumers are more likely to purchase them when they have extra income or feel confident about their financial situation. Consumer cyclical stocks include companies in sectors such as retail, automotive, travel and leisure, entertainment, and luxury goods.', ""Over the past year, we've seen clear evidence that consumers have remained strong despite challenges like high inflation, increasing interest rates, and greater recession concerns. This resilience notably buoyed the performance of stocks within the consumer discretionary sector, which includes businesses offering non-essential products and services such as apparel, automobiles, and accommodations. The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index ended 2023 with a total return of 42.41%, reporting one of its best years on record. In addition to the support from a strong consumer base, the stocks in this sector also gained from broader market trends that propelled the overall stock market higher in 2023. These trends included relief as the Federal Reserve signaled the potential end of its rate-hiking cycle as the year progressed. Furthermore, sector-level performance was boosted by specific issues affecting some of the largest companies within it. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), the two largest companies in the sector by a significant margin, have both seen remarkable gains in the past year, driven by the surge in mega-cap, tech-related stocks. Additionally, both companies are considered potential investment opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence."", ""After experiencing robust performance in 2023, analysts are also showing a preference for the sector in the current year. Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, stated that consumers' willingness to sustain moderate spending growth has been crucial for the economy. He suggested that this could be attributed, at least in part, to the robust labor market and notable wage increases. Based on a Fidelity report, the performance of sectors is expected to be influenced by broader economic factors in 2024. If inflation remains low and the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates, it could be advantageous for the sector, as consumers may be more inclined to buy expensive items like cars or homes. An even more positive scenario would be if the economy avoids a recession and job markets stay robust, which would particularly benefit this sector."", ""The report highlighted that following the sector's strong performance in 2023, stock valuations are not as low as they were previously. However, there are still segments of the market where the firm has identified robust long-term growth prospects, and where stocks are trading at attractive prices. One ongoing area of opportunity includes certain retailers. These companies possess defensive characteristics within their business models, offering some protection in case of a deteriorating economic outlook."", 'Another factor contributing to the positive outlook for the sector is that certain companies within it opt to distribute dividends when they maintain a steady cash flow and have a track record of sharing profits with shareholders.

Adjusted EBITDA is the primary measure used by management (1) to evaluate the economic productivity of our operations and (2) for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to, and assessing the performance of, our operations. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate and compare the results of our operations (1) from period to period and (2) to our competitors, by excluding the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest charges from our outstanding debt) and asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion) from our financial results. Management also believes Adjusted EBITDA is frequently used by investors or other interested parties in the evaluation of REITs. In addition, Adjusted EBITDA is similar to the measure of current financial performance generally used in our debt covenant calculations. Adjusted EBITDA should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance;', '(3) FFO, AFFO and AFFO per share, which are metrics used by our public company peers in the communication site industry, provide investors useful indicators of the financial performance of our business and permit investors an additional tool to evaluate the performance of our business against those of our two principal competitors. FFO, AFFO, and AFFO per share are also used to address questions we receive from analysts and investors who routinely assess our operating performance on the basis of these performance measures, which are considered industry standards. We believe that FFO helps investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate financial performance by excluding the impact of our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset impairment and decommission costs). We believe that AFFO and AFFO per share help investors or other interested parties meaningfully evaluate our financial performance as they include (1) the impact of our capital structure (primarily interest expense on our outstanding debt) and (2) sustaining capital expenditures and exclude the impact of (1) our asset base (primarily depreciation, amortization and accretion and asset impairment and decommission costs) and (2) certain non-cash items, including straight-lined revenues and expenses related to fixed escalations and rent free periods and the non-cash portion of our reported tax provision. GAAP requires rental revenues and expenses related to leases that contain specified rental increases over the life of the lease to be recognized evenly over the life of the lease. In accordance with GAAP, if payment terms call for fixed escalations, or rent free periods, the revenue or expense is recognized on a straight-lined basis over the fixed, non-cancelable term of the contract. We only use AFFO as a performance measure. AFFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income computed in accordance with GAAP as a measure of our performance and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operations or as residual cash flow available for discretionary investment. We believe our definition of FFO is consistent with how that term is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (""NAREIT"") and that our definition and use of AFFO and AFFO per share is consistent with those reported by the other communication site companies;', '(4) Our Non-GAAP Debt Measures provide investors a more complete understanding of our net debt and leverage position as they include the full principal amount of our debt which will be due at maturity and, to the extent that such measures are calculated on Net Debt are net of our cash and cash equivalents, short-term restricted cash, and short-term investments; and', '(5) Our Constant Currency Measures provide management and investors the ability to evaluate the performance of the business without the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.', 'In addition, Tower Cash Flow, Adjusted EBITDA, and our Non-GAAP Debt Measures are components of the calculations used by our lenders to determine compliance with certain covenants under our Senior Credit Agreement and indentures relating to our 2020 Senior Notes and 2021 Senior Notes.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer cyclical sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Invest In.\xa0', 'Consumer cyclical companies produce goods and services that are considered non-essential or discretionary, meaning consumers are more likely to purchase them when they have extra income or feel confident about their financial situation. Consumer cyclical stocks include companies in sectors such as retail, automotive, travel and leisure, entertainment, and luxury goods.', ""Over the past year, we've seen clear evidence that consumers have remained strong despite challenges like high inflation, increasing interest rates, and greater recession concerns. This resilience notably buoyed the performance of stocks within the consumer discretionary sector, which includes businesses offering non-essential products and services such as apparel, automobiles, and accommodations. The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index ended 2023 with a total return of 42.41%, reporting one of its best years on record. In addition to the support from a strong consumer base, the stocks in this sector also gained from broader market trends that propelled the overall stock market higher in 2023. These trends included relief as the Federal Reserve signaled the potential end of its rate-hiking cycle as the year progressed. Furthermore, sector-level performance was boosted by specific issues affecting some of the largest companies within it. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), the two largest companies in the sector by a significant margin, have both seen remarkable gains in the past year, driven by the surge in mega-cap, tech-related stocks. Additionally, both companies are considered potential investment opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence."", ""After experiencing robust performance in 2023, analysts are also showing a preference for the sector in the current year. Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, stated that consumers' willingness to sustain moderate spending growth has been crucial for the economy. He suggested that this could be attributed, at least in part, to the robust labor market and notable wage increases. Based on a Fidelity report, the performance of sectors is expected to be influenced by broader economic factors in 2024. If inflation remains low and the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates, it could be advantageous for the sector, as consumers may be more inclined to buy expensive items like cars or homes. An even more positive scenario would be if the economy avoids a recession and job markets stay robust, which would particularly benefit this sector."", ""The report highlighted that following the sector's strong performance in 2023, stock valuations are not as low as they were previously. However, there are still segments of the market where the firm has identified robust long-term growth prospects, and where stocks are trading at attractive prices. One ongoing area of opportunity includes certain retailers. These companies possess defensive characteristics within their business models, offering some protection in case of a deteriorating economic outlook."", 'Another factor contributing to the positive outlook for the sector is that certain companies within it opt to distribute dividends when they maintain a steady cash flow and have a track record of sharing profits with shareholders. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) are some of the best consumer cyclical dividend stocks among others that are discussed below.', 'Image by Steve Buissinne from Pixabay', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of Q4 2023 and selected consumer cyclical dividend stocks from the entertainment, technology, retail, housing, materials, and automotive industries.

(NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today announced that it is extending its industry-leading segmentation solution, Akamai Guardicore Segmentation, to hybrid cloud environments. Extending Akamai Guardicore Segmentation to the cloud helps reduce attack surfaces and helps contain attacks targeting cloud-native workloads. Network security professionals can seamlessly manage segmentation across their public cloud environments with the benefits of faster time to policy deployment, single network governance across data centers, and reduced management complexity — all through a single interface. Akamai Guardicore Segmentation will be initially available for Microsoft Azure deployments via Azure Marketplace, followed by Akamai Connected Cloud beginning later this year.', 'Thirty-three percent of IT decision-makers (ITDMs) intended to increase their use of distributed cloud services to improve security and reliability, according to a recent survey\xa0commissioned by Akamai and conducted by ClearPath Strategies. However, nearly half (48%) of ITDMs claimed that security tools were missing or underdeveloped for a distributed cloud world, underscoring the need for better security tools to protect workloads in the cloud.', 'While organizations of all sizes are implementing public cloud strategies to innovate and realize new efficiencies, challenges remain. Leveraging Akamai Guardicore Segmentation in the cloud helps organizations address a lack of visibility into application behavior, the need for multiple policies across cloud providers, and governance issues between DevOps and SecOps teams.', '""Public and multi-cloud environments are crucial to most organizations\' business operations, but they lack the native visibility and security controls required to effectively lock down a cloud. For clouds to be secure, security practitioners must be able to see which applications, workloads, and traffic flows are moving within the environment,"" said Pavel Gurvich, Senior Vice President, General Manager, Enterprise Security at Akamai. ""Applying a microsegmentation policy in the cloud can give security practitioners comprehensive visibility and control across all cloud environments, from a single interface with one set of controls, without the need for agents. We can protect business-critical applications — whether they are on-premises, in the cloud, or on legacy servers — while reducing the number of security solutions that need to be managed.""', 'Benefits of Akamai Guardicore Segmentation in the cloud include:', 'Comprehensive agentless cloud-native visibility and enforcement enables administrators to visualize cloud workloads using a near-real-time interactive map of true network flows, understanding the application dependencies and bringing together DevOps and SecOps teams in cloud network security governance.', 'Hybrid enforcement engine leveraging multiple enforcement points allows an organization to simply define the intent of network policy and have the Akamai Guardicore Segmentation policy engine take care of the rest, dynamically deciding which agent-based and agentless enforcement points are used across the data center.', 'Integrated reputation analysis and threat intelligence firewall capabilities are designed to reduce time to detection and incident response time in the event of a breach.', 'Scalable and secure solution ensures data does not leave your cloud environment and solution architecture scales automatically within it.', 'Learn more about Akamai Guardicore Segmentation\xa0and how it can contain attacks within public cloud environments.', ""About AkamaiAkamai powers and protects life online.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks in the S&P 500 and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks To Invest In 2024.\xa0', 'In 2023, despite the presence of higher interest rates, consumers remained unfazed, and investors displayed more optimism than apprehension, largely fueled by the excitement surrounding advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Consequently, the S&P 500 experienced a remarkable surge, gaining over 24% last year. This surge was primarily attributed to the dominance of what has been dubbed the ""Magnificent Seven."" These seven major companies, which include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), played a pivotal role in driving the S&P 500\'s performance, contributing significantly to its overall returns. On the flip side, a staggering 72% of stocks failed to match the performance of the S&P 500 index, setting a new record for underperformance. Additionally, dividend-paying stocks experienced a downturn in 2023, paving the way for the dominance of technology equities. Despite this, the stock market returns throughout the year were both exceptional and notably robust in comparison to historical trends.', 'Despite their recent lackluster performance, dividends remain a crucial aspect of returns for equity investors and have garnered considerable attention in capital markets research. The appeal of dividend-paying stocks is substantial, and rightfully so as they have the potential to significantly enhance long-term investment outcomes. This general observation has been well-documented across various periods and global markets. For instance, one study analyzed the components contributing to total equity returns of U.S. stocks spanning from 1802 to 2002. It revealed that dividends, along with real growth in dividends, constituted a substantial portion, accounting for 5.8% of the total annualized return of 7.9% over 200 years. Another study, conducted from a global perspective by researchers at the London Business School, examined data from 1900 to 2005 across 17 countries. It found that the real return averaged around 5%, with an average dividend yield of 4.5% during that timeframe. These findings provide compelling evidence for the significance of dividends for long-term investors.', ""Yet another report from S&P Dow Jones Indices provided insight into the enduring impact of dividend-paying equities over the long term. This report emphasized that since 1926, dividends have played a significant role, contributing roughly 32% of the total return for the S&P 500, with capital appreciations making up the remaining 68%. Hence, both sustainable dividend income and the potential for capital appreciation are key considerations for forming expectations regarding total returns. Furthermore, the growth of dividends proves to be beneficial for investors. Over an extended period, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which monitors the performance of companies with 25 or more consecutive years of dividend growth, has surpassed the S&P 500 index while exhibiting lower volatility, indicating higher risk-adjusted returns. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats' ability to mitigate losses can be observed through its upside and downside capture ratios. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, it has outperformed the S&P 500 in down months 69.34% of the time and in up months 43.61% of the time from December 29, 1989, to July 31, 2023. Additionally, it's worth noting that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats experienced lower drawdown levels compared to the benchmark index."", ""Considering these points, let's explore some of the top S&P 500 dividend-paying stocks."", 'Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay', 'Our Methodology: ', 'To create this list, we first examined the S&P 500 stocks based on their weight in the index and picked the top 25 stocks that consistently distribute dividends to their shareholders.

Ferris', ""Thank you, George, and thank you, everyone, for joining us. 2023 was a year of significant positive momentum at FIS. When I stepped in as CEO, we were facing an uncertain economy, a banking crisis, inflation and a market where new capital was scarce. And while FIS was a statured company with over 50 years of market success, it had lost its focus in recent years. Simply put, the company was not meeting expectations. It was missing financial commitments and growth opportunities. It was slow in the delivery of products, too complex for clients to navigate and selling in areas that didn't contribute to the bottom line. Fast forward a year later, and we are now a much different company with renewed focus, vision and measurable results. We took a decisive action and moved with urgency to put the company on a sustainable path for long-term success, unlocking value for shareholders and recommitting to our clients who are at the center of everything we do. In a short period of time, we successfully executed a number of significant operational commitments while consistently delivering financial outcomes ahead of expectations. Earlier this month, we announced the successful completion of the majority sale of the Worldpay business to GTCR, a key milestone for our future. This landmark transaction creates 2 market-leading companies with greater strategic flexibility and operational focus to capitalize on their respective growth and margin opportunities in rapidly evolving markets. FIS holds a meaningful 45% stake in Worldpay and the 2 companies will continue to work together closely in the future. The strategic go-to-market partnership we established with Worldpay through our commercial agreements preserves the key value propositions for clients of both companies, and it is a powerful continuation of what we started when our 2 organizations first came together. Worldpay will remain an important distribution channel for FIS while continuing to benefit from access to FIS's array of bank tech services, such as our embedded finance solutions. We are excited to partner with Charles Drucker, the Worldpay management team and GTCR, and we are confident the business is on the right trajectory to reinvigorate revenue and earnings growth. The separation reinforces FIS's position as a global enterprise software leader, servicing the technology needs of the most complex global financial institutions, multinational corporates and governments. With a sharp focus on our marquee set of clients, we are well positioned to capitalize on favorable industry trends and quickly push into faster-growing verticals and segments of the market. This builds on our first-mover technology advantages, allowing us to accelerate revenue growth as our 2024 outlook demonstrates. The Worldpay transaction also allows us to recapitalize our balance sheet, providing ample flexibility to reinvest in the business, while at the same time, accelerating capital returns to shareholders and lowering our leverage ratio. I'm pleased to announce that we are once again raising our share repurchase target. We are now committing to buying back at least $3.5 billion of stock in 2024, up from our previous $3 billion target. Including repurchases completed in the fourth quarter of 2023, this brings our total share repurchase commitment up to at least $4 billion. This increased buyback reflects our confidence in the business, a strong capital position and our view on the intrinsic value of FIS's shares. Lastly, we continue to execute against our Future Forward strategy, exceeding our targets for 2023 and increasing our commitment for operational excellence in 2024. The program is changing the way FIS operates with a focus on driving greater efficiency, effectiveness and growth for our clients and for FIS. Our successful efforts are underpinned by distinct and tangible proof points. For example, over the second half of 2023, we were able to return the company to year-over-year margin expansion, and we expect to drive further profitability improvements in 2024. We refocused our sales force to prioritize higher value, higher-margin technology sales, and we intensified our efforts to improve the customer experience, including accelerating implementations of our next-generation technology solutions. While there is still plenty of work to be done, I couldn't be prouder of the FIS team and what we've accomplished together in just a year's time. Now let's turn to a discussion of our financial results. Turning to Slide 6. The significant actions we undertook in 2023 are already driving improved financial outcomes. We delivered full year 2023 financial results ahead of our outlook, including 4 consecutive quarters of outperformance on a total company basis. Adjusted revenue growth of 2% was driven by strong total company recurring revenue growth of 4%, including 5% recurring growth across our Banking and Capital Markets segments. Profitability improvements were primarily driven by our Future Forward program. This resulted in adjusted EBITDA margin expanding over the second half of 2023, despite headwinds in high margin nonrecurring revenue such as license and termination fees. We meaningfully improved adjusted free cash flow conversion in 2023 to a normalized 95% as compared to 72% in 2022.Capital expenditures declined to approximately 8% of total company revenue in 2023, down from 9% in 2022 as a result of continued execution against Future Forward initiatives. Lastly, we returned over $1.7 billion in capital to our shareholders through the combination of both dividends and share repurchases with over $800 million in the fourth quarter. Turning to Slide 7. The trajectory of our recurring revenue growth trends exiting the year and continued expense management gives us confidence that both revenue growth and profitability are inflecting in 2024. We expect a sustainable acceleration in adjusted revenue growth from 3% in 2023 to more than 4% in 2024. This acceleration is principally driven by a meaningful improvement in Banking's revenue growth from 2% in 2023 to at least 3% in 2024. We expect the momentum we've been experiencing in our Capital Markets segment over the past few years to continue with healthy growth in excess of 6%. The segment will continue to benefit from market share gains and expansion into newer verticals. During the third quarter of 2023, fueled by the success of our Future Forward strategy, we returned the company to year-over-year adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the first time in nearly 2 years. Building on the success of Future Forward and the underlying fundamentals of the business, we are confident that the company is positioned for sustainable margin expansion in 2024 and beyond. The revenue acceleration and operational improvements just discussed, coupled with balanced capital deployment, will allow us to deliver 5% to 7% normalized EPS growth, which includes a high single-digit negative dissynergy impact. As a result of this improved financial outlook, we are committed to returning over $4 billion of capital to our shareholders across buybacks and dividends in 2024. Looking forward, current favorable market trends as well as the operational efficiencies we continue to drive, leave us confident that we are positioned for further earnings acceleration beyond 2024. Turning to Slide 8. We are seeing increased client demand and a growing sales pipeline as our products and services continue to resonate, especially with large financial institutions. Based on the current level of activity we are seeing across our pipeline, we expect an acceleration in new sales in 2024 as compared to 2023, aiding revenue growth beyond 2024. During the fourth quarter, we signed multiple marquee wins across our businesses. Beginning with enterprise core platforms, we're seeing increased demand from the regional community bank market for our bundled offerings of core digital payments through strong new sales and implementation. Additionally, we signed several new and expanded core engagements with regional community and international financial institutions, including a key competitive takeaway, Bank of California, with approximately $40 billion in assets. Also, demand for FIS's digital banking solutions remains strong. Our Digital One platform was selected by some of the most demanding banks and financial institutions, including a global asset manager with greater than $1 trillion in assets under management. Likewise, we've seen continued robust sales for our Digital One Studio with leading national regional and super regional banks, including Hancock Whitney, First Citizens Bank and Bank of Montreal. These banks have all deployed solutions from our digital suite, which offers deeper personalization capabilities in support of their deposit growth, product cross-sell and customer experience improvement objectives. To underscore our progress in digital banking, our sales pipeline continues to expand with demand from large financial institutions increasing in the double digits. Our payments and network businesses continue to gain traction, and we are expanding our sales focus in these areas given the long growth runway they represent. The NICE debit network had another strong quarter of new sales. We signed multiple new engagements with premier financial institutions, retailers and global media companies. Additionally, FedNow continues to gain traction. We now have over 215 clients either in contract or in our pipeline and we're now certified to both send and receive payments. Moving on to Capital Markets. Beginning with securities trading and processing, our market-leading clear derivative solution was selected by a global financial technology provider and a leading alternative asset manager. Additionally, our treasury solutions had another strong quarter of new sales. We signed new engagements with a leading financial technology company, several municipal governments, a multinational health care provider and an online consumer apparel provider. Our Lending Solutions also had a number of impressive new or expanded wins in the quarter. This included a leading U.S. automaker, several European automakers, as well as several global financial institutions who were seeking a partner who could service and support their global client base. I'm encouraged by the trends we experienced over the second half of 2023 and confident we are poised for a meaningful sales acceleration in 2024. 2023 was a year of significant positive momentum at FIS. I'm incredibly proud of the team for their commitment to our future forward strategy and the heightened focus on improving client centricity, accelerating product innovation and simplifying our go-to-market approach. Our performance in 2023 and our strengthened position entering 2024 give me confidence that we are on the right path to further improve operational and financial outcomes going forward. With that in mind, FIS plans to host an Investor Day in New York City on Tuesday, May 7. We hope you can join us for a discussion on our go-forward corporate strategy post the Worldpay separation, our playbook for sustainable success in our Banking and Capital Markets segments and, of course, our multiyear financial targets and capital allocation framework. With that, let me turn it over to James for a discussion of our fourth quarter financial results and 2024 outlook. James?"", 'James Kehoe', ""Thank you, Stephanie, and good morning. I'll begin on Slide 11 with some comments on our 2023 performance and the key drivers of earnings power for the upcoming year. As Stephanie noted, we are pleased with our results, having consistently exceeded the high-end of the outlook. The original EBITDA guidance was $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion and the actual results came in well above the high end of the range. The outperformance was driven by strong recurring revenue growth from both Banking and Capital Markets, profitability improvements fueled by our Future Forward program and better-than-expected performance from Worldpay, which is now reflected in discontinued operations. On January 31, we completed the majority sale of the Worldpay business. The transaction positions both companies for future success, allowing them to focus on their respective end markets and to pursue appropriate capital allocation strategies. The transaction has also allowed FIS to transform its capital structure, paying down debt to ensure an investment-grade rating while accelerating return of capital to shareholders and allowing for appropriate levels of investment in the business. FIS is now well positioned to deliver accelerating revenue growth with a return to sustainable margin expansion.Revenue growth will accelerate from 3% in 2023 to 4% to 4.5% in 2024 or 3.8% to 4.3%, excluding acquisitions and dissynergies. Adjusted EBITDA margin is projected to expand by 20 to 40 basis points. Adjusted EPS is projected to grow 38% to 41% year-over-year on a continuing operations basis, including a significant contribution from the deployment of Worldpay proceeds and the first-time inclusion of the Worldpay equity method investment contribution. On a normalized basis, we expect adjusted EPS to grow 5% to 7%, including a high single-digit negative impact from dissynergies. Strong core business performance and our Future Forward program have more than offset the negative impact from dissynergies. Turning now to Slide 12 for a few considerations on our financial reporting going forward. Beginning in the first quarter of 2024, FIS's 45% financial interest in Worldpay will now be reported separately on the equity method investment line of the income statement. Our 2024 adjusted EPS outlook of $4.66 to $4.76 includes a $0.69 to $0.71 contribution from Worldpay. Please note that the $0.69 to $0.71 is for 11 months only.Had the transaction closed at the end of last year, our 2024 adjusted EPS for continuing operations would have been $0.06 higher, resulting in a pro forma adjusted EPS of $4.72 to $4.82 on a full year basis. Consistent with our prior messaging, our go-forward adjusted EPS outlook will include the Worldpay EMI contribution and we will also be providing condensed quarterly financial results for Worldpay on a 100% basis, including revenue and EBITDA on both a GAAP and adjusted basis. Lastly, going forward, FIS will be presenting revenue growth on an adjusted basis. This reflects year-over-year constant currency revenue growth for our Banking Solutions and Capital Markets operating segments. With that, let's turn to our fourth quarter results on Slide 13. Overall, we are pleased with our performance in the fourth quarter and this is the fourth consecutive quarter of meeting or exceeding the high end of our outlook. Including Worldpay, total company revenue increased 1% to $3.7 billion, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 43.2% and adjusted EPS of $1.67. Total company adjusted EBITDA margin was flat year-over-year, held back by a margin decline in discontinued operations. On a continuing operations basis, revenue was flat at $2.5 billion, and this was in line with our expectations. Strong recurring revenue growth across both Banking and Capital Markets was offset by expected declines in nonrecurring revenue and professional services. Adjusted EBITDA margin expanded by a strong 70 basis points year-over-year, led by meaningful margin expansion in Banking Solutions. Adjusted EPS for continuing operations was $0.94 in the quarter, a decline of 4% compared to the prior year, reflecting higher interest expense with a negative impact of $0.07. For discontinued operations, revenue increased 2% to $1.2 billion, modestly ahead of our expectations. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 160 basis points reflecting a less favorable revenue mix and the timing of certain expenses. Moving now to cash flow and balance sheet metrics where we continue to drive improvements. We generated strong free cash flow of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter, resulting in a normalized free cash flow conversion of 100% with a full year conversion rate of 95%. This compares very favorably to our 2023 full year target of greater than 80% free cash flow conversion. We ended the year with total debt of $19.1 billion with a leverage ratio of 3x. As previously communicated, we repurchased $510 million of shares during the fourth quarter of '23, resulting in over $800 million of capital returned to shareholders in the quarter and $1.7 billion for the year as a whole. Turning now to our segment results on Slide 14. For the quarter, adjusted revenue growth was flat year-over-year, in line with our expectations. As expected, backlog remained stable, up $23.5 billion. Continued strong recurring revenue growth of 7% was offset by anticipated nonrecurring headwinds. Banking revenue was flat in the quarter while adjusted EBITDA margin expanded 270 basis points, primarily driven by Future Forward cost initiatives. Banking recurring revenue grew a healthy 7%, including stronger-than-expected consumer spend in our payments business and the benefit from our prior year grow-over. Note that our calculation of Banking recurring revenue growth reflects 2 changes. First, in keeping with historical practice, we have transitioned certain nonstrategic businesses, which we expect to sell or wind down from Banking Solutions to the Corporate and Other segment. Second, with the expiration of federal funds related to pandemic relief programs, we have moved this revenue from recurring revenue to nonrecurring revenue with no change to total revenue. We have provided a detailed reconciliation table for these adjustments in the appendix. As you will see, these adjustments have a de minimis impact on full year recurring revenue growth. Banking recurring revenue growth of 4% in 2023 is unchanged, while the changes increase our 2022 recurring revenue growth by a mere 40 basis points. The recurring revenue growth of 7% was offset by expected declines in other nonrecurring revenue and professional services of 22% and 31%, respectively. The decline in other nonrecurring revenue includes an 11% headwind from the decline in pandemic relief revenues, while the decline in professional services reflects a difficult comparison. Turning now to Capital Markets. Capital Markets adjusted revenue increased 1%, led by continued strong recurring revenue growth of 7%. As expected, nonrecurring revenue declined by 10%, primarily driven by a difficult year-over-year comparison related to license fees, which we have consistently messaged throughout the year. The decline in higher-margin nonrecurring license revenue was the primary driver of the 250 basis point margin contraction. Looking forward, we will be facing lower headwinds from both professional services and other nonrecurring revenue, and we expect to see closer alignment between adjusted revenue growth and recurring revenue growth. Turning now to our full year results by segment on Slide 15. Adjusted revenue growth increased 3%, led by strong recurring revenue growth of 5%. Banking revenue was up 2% as recurring revenue growth of 4% offset declines in nonrecurring revenue and lower professional services. Adjusted EBITDA margin was flat, but margins were strong in the second half of the year as Future Forward savings accelerated. Capital Markets revenue increased 5%, led by very strong recurring revenue growth of 9%. Adjusted EBITDA margin contracted 60 basis points to 50.3%, primarily due to lower margins over the second half of the year, reflecting a lower contribution from higher margin license fees. Turning now to Slide 16 for an update on Future Forward. I am pleased to report that we have exceeded our 2023 target for Future Forward OpEx savings, and we see further upside in 2024. We delivered in-period EBITDA savings of $155 million, well above our original goal of $100 million. And we are raising our 2024 incremental savings target from $215 million to $280 million. We are reiterating our total cash savings target of $1 billion for the Future Forward program. We are reaffirming our capital reduction target, increasing our OpEx savings goal and adopting a slightly more conservative view regarding the reduction in acquisition, integration and other expenses. Turning now to our capital allocation priorities on Slide 17. Our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged from the prior quarter. We intend to use our strong financial position and balance sheet flexibility to prioritize a balanced set of capital allocation priorities. These priorities include maintaining an investment-grade rating while investing to accelerate growth and consistently returning ample capital to shareholders. For 2024, we are assuming a year-end leverage ratio of approximately 2.8x, which allows us ample flexibility to invest in the business while increasing our share repurchase target for the year. We remain committed to paying an above-market dividend. And going forward, we will grow the dividend in line with adjusted net earnings.Reflecting our confidence in the business and our strong free cash flow generation, we are once again raising our share repurchase commitment. We now expect to repurchase at least $3.5 billion of stock in 2024, up from our prior target of at least $3 billion. And through the first 2 months of this year, we have already repurchased approximately $490 million of the $3.5 billion target. Lastly, we will selectively invest in complementary tuck-in M&A where we can leverage our scale and distribution to drive faster growth across strategic verticals. This balanced capital allocation framework provides a robust value proposition for long-term shareholder value creation. In total, we expect to return greater than $4 billion to shareholders in 2024, up from $1.7 billion in 2023. Now let's move on to our 2024 outlook on Slide 18. Building on the operational and financial improvements of 2023, our '24 outlook confidently forecast accelerating revenue growth and expanding margins. We are projecting reported revenue of $10.1 billion to $10.15 billion and this includes an adverse currency impact of around $20 million. Adjusted revenue growth will accelerate from 3% in '23 to 4% to 4.5% in 2024. Our projections include 70 basis points from closed tuck-in acquisitions, but this is mostly offset by a negative impact of 50 basis points from dissynergies. Net of these impacts, adjusted revenue growth would be approximately 3.8% to 4.3%. We expect the Banking segment to grow between 3% to 3.5% or 3.3% to 3.8% net of acquisitions and dissynergies, up from 2% in 2023. And we anticipate Capital Markets revenue growth of 6.5% to 7% or 5.1% to 5.6%, net of acquisitions as compared to 5% in 2023. We are forecasting year-over-year margin expansion of 20 to 40 basis points reflecting continued favorable impact from the Future Forward program and the inherent leverage in our business model. Included in this outlook is a $280 million year-over-year benefit from the Future Forward program, and this will more than offset dissynergies from the Worldpay transaction of $250 million. We have provided our assumptions regarding the key below-the-line items with some additional details in the appendix. We are projecting D&A of $1.075 billion and we anticipate a tax rate of 17.2% to 17.5%. Interest expense is projected at around $350 million and we expect shares outstanding of 556 million shares, a reduction of 6% compared to 2023. Including an 11-month EMI contribution of $0.69 to $0.71, we expect to deliver adjusted EPS of between $4.66 and $4.76. This translates to a growth rate of 38% to 41% on a continuing operations basis. On a normalized basis, we expect adjusted EPS to grow 5% to 7%, including a high single-digit negative impact from dissynergies. Lastly, on a pro forma basis, including 12 months of Worldpay EMI contribution, we anticipate adjusted EPS of $4.72 to $4.82. We are confident in our balanced outlook for 2024 and believe we are well positioned to accelerate long-term earnings growth. Let's move now to Slide 19, where we provide a reconciliation for our 2023 results on a normalized basis. Last quarter, we provided an estimated normalized adjusted EPS range of $4.40 to $4.55. I am happy to report that both continuing ops EPS and normalized EPS came in within the guidance ranges we provided. Continuing operations EPS was $3.37 and was at the higher end of the range that we provided on the third quarter call. On a 12-month basis, normalized EPS was $4.50 and again, this was toward the higher end of the range. Adjusted for an 11-month EMI contribution, 2023 normalized EPS is $4.44. Moving now to Slide 20 for an overview of our first quarter outlook. We are projecting revenue growth of 2.5% to 3.5%, with Banking Solutions at 1% to 2% and Capital Markets at 6% to 7%. We expect Banking revenue growth to accelerate over the course of the year, reflecting easier year-over-year revenue comparisons and the favorable impact from stronger new sales over the second half of 2023. We are anticipating adjusted EBITDA of $955 million to $970 million, which translates to year-over-year margin expansion of 180 to 200 basis points, reflecting Future Forward savings. Including an expected 2-month EMI contribution of $0.09 to $0.10, we expect adjusted EPS of $0.94 to $0.97. Continuing operations EPS is projected to increase 31% to 35% and we estimate high single-digit growth on a normalized basis. In summary, we are expecting a good start to the year with revenue growth accelerating compared to the fourth quarter and improved alignment between adjusted revenue and recurring revenue growth. Margins will expand and this is consistent with the performance delivered in the second half of last year. Let me now wrap up on Slide 21. In closing, we are encouraged by our 2023 results and believe we are on the right path as we reposition the enterprise for long-term success. The completion of the Worldpay transaction positions both companies for future success and meaningfully improves our capital structure. We are confident FIS will deliver accelerated business growth in 2024 with adjusted revenue growth of at least 4% and a return to consistent margin expansion. And given our confidence in how the business is performing, our improved financial flexibility and the attractive valuation of our stock, we have once again raised our total share repurchase target to at least $3.5 billion in 2024 and greater than $4 billion in total.With that, operator, could you please open the line for questions?"", 'Operator', '(Operator Instructions) And our first question will come from the line of Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.', 'Tien-Tsin Huang', ""Just hoping to maybe have you comment a little further on the Banking side, just a formula for just the revenue acceleration there in the Banking segment. I know there's backlog conversion, new sales, you talked about a little bit, retention. Any call outs there as we sketch the outlook?"", 'Stephanie L. Ferris', ""Yes. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Yes, we're very excited to be guiding to an accelerated total company revenue growth in 2024 as well as in Banking specifically. As we talked about last year, we came in from a recurring revenue standpoint pretty strong, but we're facing some nonrecurring headwinds as we disclosed all year.As we come into 2024, feeling really good about lapping those headwinds. So thinking about recurring and total Banking Solutions revenue growth coming more in line together as well as the strength that we're seeing in the back half of 2023 and into 2024 from a sales standpoint, and as we think about those sales coming in and delivering on revenue in the back half of '24 and into '25. So both scenarios are helping us in terms of giving us confidence for Banking Solutions and the total company revenue growth to accelerate in 2024, which is why we feel good about what we've guided."", 'Tien-Tsin Huang', ""It's good. Just my quick follow-up then. Stephanie, anything to consider with respect to M&A in the bank sector? I know we've been, sector-wise, getting a lot of questions on the Cap One-Discover piece. Opportunities? Risks?"", 'Stephanie L. Ferris', ""Yes. No. Well, first of all, I'd say in terms of Capital One-Discover, I think it's another representation of why it's really important and how people strategically value having many different assets across the FinTech ecosystem, which, as you know, at FIS is critical for us in terms of thinking about issuing, payments network, et cetera. And then with the strategic relationship we struck with Worldpay going forward, we'll still have access to the acquiring piece. So I think it's a demonstration in terms of seeing why the value of having all those assets together is important.With respect to Cap One and Discover, we have very strategic relationships with both. So we see it for us in terms of a net positive. Broadly across the ecosystem, TBD in terms of consolidation. We continue to see folks that would love to consolidate. We'll see what happens with the regulatory environment. But as you know, we tend to be beneficiaries of that consolidation because we tend to serve the larger financial institutions. But I'm waiting and seeing just like everybody else."", 'Operator', 'One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.', 'Ramsey Clark El-Assal', 'I was wondering if you could help us think through the sort of macro assumptions in your guidance. And maybe any thoughts about the general sort of bank IT spending environment, particularly as it relates to the backlog.', 'Stephanie L. Ferris', ""Sure. Maybe I'll start, and if James thinks I miss anything, he'll add on. But I would say broadly, in terms of macro assumptions, we would say, as we come in on the payment side of our business within the Banking business, we kept consumer spend pretty consistent in 2024 over 2023. In terms of overall Banking spend, I think we see 2 different things happening.I certainly think we see banks who have the opportunity to trend down on discretionary spend. They've been doing that quite frankly. It's not a new trend. Where we see the demand continuing and you heard me talk about it in my prepared remarks is spend around digital to continue to enhance their ability to deliver products and services and then really focused around making sure that they can gather deposits. So utilizing our money movement capabilities and our payment capabilities to help them become the primary depositor for a lot of their lenders. So I would say there's interest in spending around digital, around money movement capabilities.And then as the regulatory environment continues to heat up, always a focus around our RegTech products. So I would say overall, IT spend in the Banking sector is pretty consistent. We just continue to see it move into those categories and spending less around anything that they would consider discretionary."", 'Ramsey Clark El-Assal', 'Okay. And I wanted also to ask about the nonrecurring and professional services revenues in Banking. And I know there were some moving pieces there and some tough comps on the professional services side, I believe, you called out. How should we think about the sort of timing and magnitude of the reacceleration of those parts of the business on a normalized basis? Is that the type of thing where, over time, it should grow around where the rest of the segment is growing? Or how should we kind of think about that?', 'James Kehoe', ""Yes. I'll just give you maybe a way to think about it. We're not providing explicit guidance for recurring revenue. What we did say in the prepared comments, in 2024, we would expect recurring revenue to at least be equal to the adjusted revenue and probably slightly better. So if the total company has gone up X, the recurring revenue is slightly positive compared to that. So that implies that still next year, there's a slight headwind coming from the total of professional services and other nonrecurring, but it's dramatically reduced compared to 2023.So the key message for you is there's -- if you take the year as an average, and that's the only caution I would give you, on the average of the year, recurring will be better than nonrecurring, but the quarters could vary. So all over that, sometimes it's a little bit choppy in a particular quarter. But overall, we're very confident in the realignment between recurring and total revenue growth."", 'Operator', 'One moment for our next question. That will come from the line of David Koning with Baird.', 'David John Koning', ""Guys, nice job. And I guess my first question, a little bit like Ramsey, on recurring. So in the first half of '23, I think you grew 3% recurring, second half about 7%, if I get that right. And now you're calling for it to come back down maybe a little better than the 3-ish percent. What was happening in the second half that was so strong in recurring? And then why does it decelerate in '24?"", 'James Kehoe', ""Yes. I think if you look out, Capital Markets is generally in line. We expect almost every quarter to be in line with the full year guidance. And the recurring is just -- it's basically in line with the adjusted revenue target we provided. And then if you look through the Banking, I think the -- you should look at the 7% that was in fourth quarter, and that's probably well above the trend rate, which is closer to the 3% to 4%. And you'll recall that during the course of all of 2023, Banking was in or around 3%, 3.5%. The 7% in Q4 did include an exceptionally strong payments business, where it was probably 3 points ahead of the average that we're planning for the first quarter. So that gives you 1 delta, call it, I don't know, 130 basis points.And then we're lapping an item in the prior year period, which artificially depressed the prior period, call it another, I don't know, 130 basis points. So you take the 2 of those out, and we kind of get to a couple of other adjustments. We're getting to kind of like a real like a 4% if we were trying to equalize it into next year. And as I said in the prepared comments, Banking recurring will outperform the adjusted targets.So it was a choppy kind of 7% in the fourth quarter, not fully representative. What I will say, though, the 7% does show that the business has substantial -- Banking business has substantial power to get the numbers into the territory where they need to be. We're very comfortable as we look forward to the goals on the full year."", 'David John Koning', 'Great. And just maybe a quick follow-up on -- merger integration costs came down this year, which was nice to see, I think, $156 million in Q4. What do you expect that to be in 2024? And how soon are those integration costs just going to be closer to 0?', 'James Kehoe', ""Yes. I think it's a little early to call. We've got a bunch of stuff in there. It's not -- the biggest single item is not integration costs. It's actually the Future Forward program. So remember, we've taken out a lot of costs in the base year of '23 and more coming out in '24. Worldpay has inflated the base year, and that will reduce next year. But we will still have Worldpay separation costs in '24. They will disappear in '25.What we're looking at right now is what is the long-term TAI. And you've seen that we've had a fairly big dissynergy impact. As we look forward into '25 and '26, we're thinking through what kind of programs need to be implemented to gain -- regain the efficiency that was lost post Worldpay. I think the explicit cash flow number impact of TAI next year in '24 is around [$450 million]."", 'Stephanie L. Ferris', ""I might also add. So -- yes, we did a lot this year, as you know, it's showing up in the free cash flow conversion. The separation of Worldpay is pretty significant. So there's pretty significant costs that we expect in '24 and '25 to keep that elevated. Everything else, though, we keep pulling down to deliver a higher free cash flow conversion. But it's not nothing to get Worldpay separated. And as we've discussed before, we expect that to take up to 24 months. So we'll spend some pretty significant dollars to get those guys out."", 'Operator', 'One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Darrin Peller with Wolfe Research.', 'Darrin David Peller', 'Congrats on the closing of the Worldpay.', 'Stephanie L. Ferris', 'Thank you.', 'Darrin David Peller', ""So i wanted to just start off with -- I wanted to start off with first, just the margin side for a minute. Look, it looks like you raised your Future Forward savings a bit and transaction dissynergies also were raised. And yet, I think your margin, you said is expecting 20 to 40 bps on a continuing operations basis. Maybe just talk a little bit about the underlying margin assumptions and the underlying trajectory of operating leverage that you see in this business going forward, if you don't mind, but really both segments in the company overall."", 'Stephanie L. Ferris', ""Yes. I think we were -- I'll start and then maybe James can add in. I think we -- as you guys know, we've been really, really focused on driving and outperforming our Future Forward program. We're extraordinarily pleased with how that's been going. And we -- and really, we're pushing it in to be the culture of the company versus a program that ends. So really pushed on that hard, and we're able to deliver an increased expectation for that, both in '23 and '24, which, as we said, is going to offset any dissynergy.I think as we think about go-forward margins, we would expect that there should be natural margin expansion in the business, especially as we shift the sales from less technology-enabled sales into the higher technology-enabled sales. And so as we do that specifically in the Banking Solutions business, you would expect to see Banking Solutions margins naturally expand with that mix expansion.I think we've talked about Capital Markets in terms of being pretty consistent. We really want to drive organic growth there and I think squeezing any more margin out of them will ultimately, over time, hurt their overall organic growth. So I would expect that to be more flattish as we think about out in the -- out past '24. But I think we'd really probably punt on this question, Darrin, until Investor Day to give you a more clean view of how we think about margins going past 2024."", 'James Kehoe', ""Yes. But we did say, Darrin, in the prepared comments that we -- this is the return to consistent margin expansion over time. So you can imply that some of the businesses will deliver with -- together with Future Forward, will give consistent improvement. And obviously, we'll spend a fair amount of time at Investor Day, bringing you through the growth algorithm, top line growth and margin expansion. You've seen as well that Banking is really -- we're really executing strongly against Future Forward, and the margins are very, very strong. And as Stephanie said, probably Capital Markets, but I want to emphasize both businesses, if you read through the comments, both businesses are growing margins in 2024."", 'Darrin David Peller', ""And this is just a bit of a -- that's helpful guys. This is just a bit of a follow-up to Tien-Tsin's question. But maybe if you could provide any more KPIs really that's providing for the strength, what's supporting the strength of Capital Markets? And then even Banking, what can give us more confidence that this recurring revenue growth rate now is going to be sustainable? What are the driving forces of it? A little more detail would be great. And I'll turn it back to the queue."", 'James Kehoe', ""It's actually coming from the total addressable market. And I think this is probably the #1 topic for Investor Day, which is we will present the breakup -- the makeup of each of the businesses and what's the relative growth in the TAM. And Capital Markets, for example, is right now, the TAM is in or about the ex-acquisition number at about 5%. So it's got -- you've got a favorable tailwind coming from, you're in very, very attractive verticals in the market. And they're actually, at the same time, expanding into new verticals. So we'll bring you on the journey on Capital Markets because we know people have a bunch of questions on it, but it's supported by TAM and -- total addressable market and expansion into new TAM and we have very, very good line of sight to support the guidance number we've provided for '24."", 'Operator', 'One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.', 'Jason Alan Kupferberg', ""I wanted to ask about free cash flow conversion and CapEx assumptions for 2024. And then if you can just make broader comments around the 2024 guidance. Obviously, after the outperformance in '23, are there any elements of conservatism in that overall '24 outlook either from a top or a bottom line standpoint?"", 'James Kehoe', ""I'll cover the free cash flow conversion. We had a tremendous year this year, but sometimes you're a victim of your own success. We drove massive benefits from Future Forward. And mostly with -- when you capture benefits on free cash flow, they're onetime in nature. So the question is, what can we achieve in Future Forward next year? We would probably say that if you take out all the noise, the continuing ops cash flow was in the high 80s to low 90s percent on -- in 2023. And we would forecast somewhere in the region of 85% to 90% free cash flow conversion.So we're taking it up compared to the ingoing position in 2023 of 80%. Now we're looking at 85% to 90%. And depending on how we can manage our net working capital going forward, the long-term outlook could even be a little bit better than that. So we're just -- bear in mind, we just spun off part of the company. We're working through how much cash do we need in the business. We're working through working capital programs. So 85% and 90% for 2024 and it's probably closer to the 90% if you look into '25 and '26. And the second part of your question was?"", 'Stephanie L. Ferris', ""CapEx and Guidance. Yes. I think on the CapEx side -- yes. On the CapEx side, I think we feel really good. We brought it down, as you know, from a high at one point of 10%. Last year, I think we brought it down to 9%. We're expecting it to come down 1 point. Probably sits in the 7% to 8% range as we think about continuing to invest in the business.With respect to guidance, I think what we would say, Jason, is we're thrilled with our ability to hit and become just much more consistent in terms of what we guide and meeting expectations. We thought it was really important, and we're thrilled to be able to talk about an acceleration of revenue from 2023 to 2024. And we're guiding consistently with how we have historically and continue to be transparent and credible."", 'Operator', 'One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Dan Dolev with Mizuho.', 'Dan Dolev', ""Great to see the guiding for acceleration in '24. Nice job. A quick question, like -- a question on backlog, like it was negative, flat, positive, negative. How do we connect it with the organic growth guide? Is there like a good sort of mapping that we can do to make sense out of it?"", 'Stephanie L. Ferris', ""Yes. Great question. So look, I think in terms of backlog, it came in about $23 billion in fourth quarter, accelerating out of September or the third quarter of $22.2 billion. So I felt really good about that. Flat with December of 2022, so $23 billion to $23 billion.I think as we come into Investor Day, we're going to look to give you better KPIs than this backlog number. As you know, it's a fairly complicated accounting number. I think what we would say is it's consistent, it's large and it's durable and supportive of the adjusted growth rate revenues we've been giving you. But we would look to give you something a little bit more aligned and helping you understand how it compares specifically to the guide. We've been stuck with this backlog number, as you know, from historical pieces. And there's just a lot that goes into it as it's a technical accounting number.But I would say broadly, again, thinking about it, came in around the $23 billion number accelerating off of September, the third quarter. And so feeling very good about it as it goes into 2024. But we'd love to give you something different and a little bit more meaningful as we come in at Investor Day."", 'Dan Dolev', ""That's super helpful. And maybe, Stephanie, quick follow-up for you. On FedNow, you mentioned that we're kind of maybe 6 months in, like have you seen any changes or beginning of changes and meaningful behavior changes in how FedNow is implemented?"", 'Stephanie L. Ferris', ""Yes. I think -- as I said, we're seeing a large amount of pipeline. There's a large demand from FIs and banks across the universe for it. I think the challenge for it is how it becomes adopted downmarket in the underlying customers of those banks. But the banks are definitely focused on enabling it and having it in their quiver in terms of things that they can offer in terms of money movement. TBD in terms of the underlying business moves and whether it becomes adopted faster than other ways to move money in the ecosystem. I think that remains to be played out."", 'Operator', 'One moment for our next question. And that will come from the line of Vasu Govil with KBW.', 'Vasundhara Govil', ""I guess as my first one, Stephanie, you talked a little bit about the new sales momentum. Maybe you could talk a little bit more about where you're seeing traction between the 2 segments and then within the segments, whether it's more core wins, more cross-sells. Just some more color there would be super helpful."", 'Stephanie L. Ferris', ""Yes. No, happy to. So I think in the new sales momentum, we're -- as you know, we shifted specifically the team so that they would sell more of our technology-enabled solutions. So where I'm seeing momentum is really in the digital space and in the money movement space. So as you think about what banks are focused on doing, in order for them to deliver their products and solutions, the digital capabilities they have, whether it's mobile, online, teller, et cetera, all need to be in sync and refreshed and there's a lot of demand there.So seeing a lot of demand for our Digital One Studio, our Digital One business capabilities as banks are really looking to gather deposits. So the digital capabilities are in high demand. And then as banks think about really want be the primary deposit account for those loans they've gathered over the last 10 years, they want -- they need to make sure that they have the right money movement capabilities to deliver to be that primary bank. And so we are seeing a lot of demand in digital and payments.I would say in Capital Markets, and spent a little bit of time talking about this in the prepared remarks, I think we're seeing demand really across all 3 of our subsegments. Thinking about securities and processing, we've talked about our clear derivative solution. It continues to be a market-leading solution even outside the traditional broker dealers. So that's been in high demand.Our commercial lending technology solutions really are getting adopted even outside the traditional financial institutions. So if you're a sophisticated financial services corporate, so we talked a lot about auto dealers and other large sophisticated financial services, they need a lot of capabilities. They are seeing high demand there. And then treasury. Our treasury solution is best-of-breed, and we see folks adopting that across the corporate landscape.And then the other place that we're seeing a ton of demand is in overall ESG. We have a fantastic ESG product. Every company that's an SEC registrant company needs to have some sort of ESG reporting capability to see a lot of demand there."", 'Vasundhara Govil', ""That's super helpful. And then just a quick follow-up for James. I think normalized EPS, if you exclude dissynergies, is roughly low teens. Is that a good way to think about the future trend line, all else equal? And if you could also give us something on just the timing of how we should model these dissynergies to flow through the year."", 'James Kehoe', ""Well, I think we said it's 5% to 7%, but it's absorbing a significant dissynergy impact. The reason why -- so I wouldn't necessarily add the 2 together to project forward because we've really ramped up Future Forward this year to help offset the dissynergies. And I think the level of -- obviously, next year, there's no year-on-year dissynergy, but the level of contribution from Future Forward will go down from current levels.Let's just wait until the Investor Day. We want to bring you through a detailed walk on the earnings power of each business, the revenue growth, total addressable markets, the margin potential and we'll come up with the algorithms together in a short couple of months."", 'Operator', 'And we do have time for one final question, and that will come from the line of Ashwin Shirvaikar with Citi.', 'Ashwin Vassant Shirvaikar', 'Stephanie, James, good to hear from you. Stephanie, it was good to see you on stage with Charles Drucker...', 'Stephanie L. Ferris', 'Thanks, Ashwin.', 'Ashwin Vassant Shirvaikar', ""Yes, sales conference. I guess speaking of sales conference, right, you've mentioned in your comments, the direction of the sales force towards higher-yielding products and such. Is it primarily redirection? Or are you adding to the sales force? Could you give us some flavor of what's going on with sales count, sales quarters and so on?"", 'Stephanie L. Ferris', ""Yes. No, so it's really all of the above. So we took a look at how we were compensating the sales force at the beginning of last year and all dollars at that point were considered equal. And so what we did was change the incentive comp sales so that the higher-margin products will be compensated higher and specifically with respect to recurring revenue. That took hold in the beginning of last year, and we're seeing the transition of those sales from the lower margin to the higher margin. In fact, I think over time, from '22 to '23, we saw an 80 basis point increase in the mix of low margin to high margin. So we're definitely seeing it.I think the other thing that we did at the beginning of last year was really look at productivity across our sales teams and did a pretty significant look at how we wanted -- what the sales productivity metrics we were expecting. Again, in the back -- from the beginning, the first half of '23 to the back half of '23, saw some pretty significant increases in productivity.In terms of overall number of salespeople, I think that in general, we would say they're the same number, but I think we are seeing better output because of productivity and then as well as a result of higher margins. So that's what giving us some confidence as we think about the back half of '24 and '25 as those sales start to come in and get delivered into the P&L."", 'Ashwin Vassant Shirvaikar', 'Got it. Got it. And then, James, just more granularity on cadence by segment. You provided obviously, on the Cap Market side, but on both Banking and how we should model out the equity line with regard to just sort of quarter-over-quarter as we think of the 4 quarters, that would be helpful from a modeling perspective.', 'James Kehoe', ""Yes. As I said, the revenue on Capital Markets will be pretty consistent each of the quarters. And Banking is on an upward trend as the sales pick up in the second half based on second half '23 performance. As you look at the NCI contribution, bear in mind that the first quarter was the lowest quarter, and it's only got 2 months in there. And we actually called out that 1 month in the first quarter is equivalent to $0.06. So you could kind of work out the first quarter.I think in terms of the build go forward, I think the only guidance I could give you is maybe to treat the other quarters pretty equally. I'm not really now prepared. We don't want to give guidance beyond the first quarter."", 'Operator', ""Thank you all for participating. This concludes today's program. You may now disconnect.""]"

Therefore the company's full-year revenue of $25.5 billion is substantially lower than its systemwide sales of $130 billion."", ""Investors who dig a little deeper into its financial statements will find one further nuance to the numbers for McDonald's: In 2023, the company generated revenue of over $9.8 billion -- a whopping 38% of its total revenue -- from something that has nothing to do with its food."", ""Franchisees for McDonald's are required to pay ongoing royalties and franchise fees for operating a McDonald's restaurant.

That mantra is part of Buffett\'s long-term investment philosophy of investing in high-quality businesses run by strong management teams. ', ""While Buffett would love to hold all his stock forever, few stand the test of time. However, one stock Buffett sees as a potential forever holding is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Here's a look at what Buffett had to say about the oil stock\xa0in Berkshire's latest annual letter to shareholders, as he likened it to his company's stakes in Coca-Cola and American Express."", 'Buffett wrote in his latest shareholder letter: ', 'This year, I would like to describe two other investments that we expect to maintain indefinitely. Like Coke and AmEx, these commitments are not huge relative to our resources. They are worthwhile, however, and we were able to increase both positions during 2023. ', ""Occidental was one of those investments Berkshire's investment in five very large Japanese companies was the other. "", 'In discussing Occidental, Buffett noted that Berkshire owned 27.8% of its outstanding shares at the end of last year. In addition, it owns warrants for five more years that give it ""the option to materially increase our ownership at a fixed price."" Berkshire received those warrants when it made a $10 billion preferred investment in Occidental in 2019 to help fund its purchase of rival Anadarko Petroleum. ', ""Buffett's company has received regulatory approval to buy up to half of Occidental Petroleum. That approval, combined with Berkshire's massive and growing cash position, has led to a lot of speculation that it might seek to buy the oil company. "", 'However, Buffett wrote, ""Though we very much like our ownership, as well as the option, Berkshire has no interest in purchasing or managing Occidental."" Instead of buying the whole company, Berkshire will probably continue adding to its Occidental position when it trades at an attractive price to steadily increase its ownership, potentially up to the 50% it has the approval to own. ', 'Buffett then highlighted the three factors driving his view that Occidental could be an indefinite holding: ""We particularly like its vast oil and gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives, though the economic feasibility of this technique has yet to be proven. Both of these activities are very much in our country\'s interest.""', 'He noted that it wasn\'t that long ago that the U.S. was ""woefully dependent on foreign oil."" However, thanks to a significant improvement in the economics of shale drilling, the U.S. is now a major oil producer. That means OPEC isn\'t the dominant force it once was in the oil market, and Occidental is playing a key role. It has become a major oil producer, which is good for the country. ', ""Buffett also highlighted Occidental's leadership in carbon capture. The oil company has a long history of using carbon dioxide to coax more oil out of legacy fields by injecting it into oil reservoirs to increase pressure and production through a process known as enhanced oil recovery. It's now leveraging its expertise in injecting carbon dioxide to capitalize on the massive carbon capture and sequestration opportunity. It's developing a decarbonization business by building direct air capture facilities that pull the greenhouse gas out of the air. It's commercializing the technology, which, like its oil production, is good for the country (and the environment). "", ""While it's not an economically proven technology yet, it could be very good for Occidetnal's bottom line. Its CEO, Vicki Hollub, believes carbon capture and sequestration could become a $3 trillion to $5 trillion global market. That drives her belief that it could eventually make as much money from the technology as it currently does from producing oil and gas. "", ""Finally, Buffett highlighted Occidental's management team:"", ""Under Vicki Hollub's leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both its country and its owners. No one knows what oil prices will do over the next month, year, or decade. But Vicki does know how to separate oil from rock, and that's an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country."", 'Buffett loves to invest in well-managed companies. That describes Occidental under the leadership of Vicki Hollub. She has been a good steward of the company, its oil resources that are crucial to the country, and now the environment by helping spearhead the commercialization of carbon capture technology.', ""Buffett's company has built a large position in Occidental Petroleum. While he has no plans to buy the entire company, he expects to hold the oil stock indefinitely because of its importance to the country and strong leadership. Occidental's large oil business and emerging carbon capture platform position it to grow value for shareholders, including Berkshire, in the future under the adept leadership of Vicki Hollub.

Buffett just revealed the eight stocks that he thinks Berkshire Hathaway will likely hold forever -- and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) wasn't one of them."", 'In his letter written to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year, Buffett discussed two long-term holdings -- American Express (NYSE: AXP) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO). He noted that Berkshire completed building big positions in both stocks in the mid-1990s after several years of buying.', 'American Express and Coca-Cola have been massive winners for Buffett and Berkshire. In his letter written last year, he used them to make an important point: ""The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders.""', 'Buffett mentioned AmEx and Coca-Cola again in his most recent letter to Berkshire shareholders, which was released on Saturday. He emphasized the lesson from these two purchases: ""When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it.""', 'In his latest shareholder letter, Buffett added other stocks that he said Berkshire ""expect[s] to maintain indefinitely."" The first new addition to the list was Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY).', ""Berkshire has been buying Occidental shares hand over fist. At the end of 2023, the conglomerate's stake in the company stood at 27.8%. It's now the sixth-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio."", 'Buffett stressed that Berkshire doesn\'t have any intention of fully acquiring Occidental or gaining control of the oil and gas producer. However, he said that ""we very much like our ownership,"" along with the option to increase Berkshire\'s position.', 'There are two things about Occidental that Buffett especially likes. First, the company has extensive oil and gas operations in the U.S. Second, Occidental is a leader in carbon capture.', 'Although Buffett acknowledged that the technology is still unproven, he argued that it, along with Occidental\'s large oil and gas holdings, ""are very much in our country\'s interest.""', ""Buffett discussed the other five stocks that he believes Berkshire will hold practically forever as a group, rather than individually. They're the five huge Japanese trading houses:"", 'Itochu (OTC: ITOCF) (OTC: ITOCY)', 'Marubeni (OTC: MARUY)', 'Mitsui (OTC: MITSF) (OTC: MITSY)', 'Mitsubishi (OTC: MSBHF)', 'Sumitomo (OTC: SSUM.F) (OTC: SSUM.Y)', ""Berkshire currently owns stakes of roughly 9% in each of these Japanese companies. Buffett noted that the conglomerate has committed that it wouldn't increase its ownership in any of them beyond 9.9%."", 'What does Buffett like about these five companies? For one thing, he mentioned that each of them ""operates in a highly diversified manner somewhat similar to the way Berkshire itself is run."" He likes the Japanese companies\' policies that are beneficial to shareholders, including smart stock buybacks. Buffett also stated that the investments could open the door for Berkshire to partner with the companies down the road.', ""Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, by far. Buffett didn't list the tech giant in his list of stocks that Berkshire would hold forever. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Berkshire even trimmed its position in Apple."", ""Does this mean that Buffett doesn't view Apple as a forever kind of stock? I don't think so."", ""For one thing, it's important to remember that Buffett only focuses on a small number of specific Berkshire holdings in each shareholder letter. He didn't discuss Occidental (except for one brief mention), Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, or Sumitomo in last year's letter, even though Berkshire owned all of these stocks then."", 'In May 2023 at Berkshire\'s shareholder meeting, Buffett stated that Apple ""is a better business than any we own."" Again, all eight of the stocks that he indicated he thinks Berkshire will own indefinitely were in Berkshire\'s portfolio when he made that statement.', ""The bottom line is that we shouldn't assume that there aren't other stocks in addition to American Express, Coca-Cola, Occidental, and the five Japanese trading-house stocks that Berkshire will hold for decades to come.

It would be more accurate to describe its business model as the management of perks and rewards programs that just happen to revolve around charge cards."", ""Individuals and business alike will pay as much as $695 per year for the right to use an American Express card simply because cardholders receive credit toward air travel tickets, rebates on certain forms of at-home entertainment, spendable credits at a handful of retailers, bonus hotel-stay time, cash back on grocery purchases, and more. Other card companies offer perks, but none of those rival programs hold a candle to American Express'."", 'The company not only generates fee-based revenue each and every year, of course, but also collects interest payments as well as a small portion of each card-based transaction it facilitates. This is why the company has been such a reliable grower for years now despite plenty of competition.', ""It's also worth noting that American Express' clientele tends to be more affluent than average, which means its customers are less likely to become delinquent on their payments or outright default on their loans."", ""In this vein, while higher interest rates and a challenging economy are now leading lenders to report bigger write-downs, American Express' past-dues and write-offs are holding more or less level. Ironically, this stock could be a relative safe haven should the economy continue to weaken."", ""Berkshire Hathaway is holding nearly 152 million shares of American Express, by the way -- a position it's been sitting on since 2006. It's also Berkshire's third-biggest holding, if that tells you anything."", ""American Express may account for a significant chunk of the Berkshire Hathaway stock portfolio, but it's a distant third to the fund's single-biggest position. That honor belongs to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). This $174 billion trade makes up half of Berkshire's holdings in publicly traded companies."", ""There's no denying the iPhone maker's very best days may be in the rearview mirror. Last quarter's top line was up a modest 2% year over year, bouncing back only a bit from the 3% revenue lull reported for the fiscal year ended in September. iPhone revenue remains relatively stagnant, and IDC reports that unit sales of iPhones have actually been declining for over a year now. Given that the popular smartphone makes up over half of Apple's business, this trend is more than a little concerning."", ""The company is pivoting, though. Take its services arm as an example. Sales of apps and digital content are now the organization's second-biggest business. And, while still miles behind the iPhone in terms of the total amount of operating profit it produces, Apple's operating profit margins on its services business are ridiculously high at 70% of its revenue. Indeed, this division now accounts for roughly one-third of the company's bottom line. As this services unit grows, it's going to make an oversized impact on Apple's overall net income."", ""It's not just the ongoing growth of its services business keeping Buffett and his acolytes on board with Apple. The company's finally venturing into other businesses lines that mesh well with its existing technologies. For instance, it's reinventing its voice-activated assistant Siri now that artificial intelligence is making such tools wildly useful. Its recently launched Vision Pro goggles represent the next step in the evolution of augmented reality as well, even if it's not yet perfectly clear how this tech can be best monetized."", ""The point is, Apple's got several different levers it can pull here even if the iPhone itself has peaked."", 'Last but not least, add The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks you may want to consider buying for yourself.', ""It's not a complicated, sexy pick. But that's kind of the point. When you own a stake in Coca-Cola, you own a piece of a cash-generating juggernaut that's easy to defend. This cash is then turned into dividends, which have not only been paid like clockwork every quarter for decades, but have now been raised in each of the past 62 years. There are only a handful of companies out there that can make the same (or better) claim."", ""The secret to Coca-Cola's success? There are three of them actually, although they're not exactly secrets. The first of these is Coca-Cola's ability to build and maintain brands that consumers love and purchase without even thinking about it. More than mere marketing, Coca-Cola is part of a lifestyle, and even part of the global culture."", ""The second pillar of The Coca-Cola Company's consistent success is its business model. It's not quite what you may think it is. It's never actually bottled all of its products, and in recent years it's done very little of its own bottling. Rather, its core business is selling concentrated flavor syrups to bottlers that then take on the burden -- and the inconsistent costs -- of producing the products you find placed in stores."", 'This model is a much more consistent one than bottling itself, since the cost of creating and handling these syrups is minimal compared to the labor-intensive and input-intensive process of creating the final products that consumers buy.', ""Finally, while you certainly know the company's namesake cola, The Coca-Cola Company is far more diversified than you might realize. In addition to familiar sodas like Sprite and Fanta, Coca-Cola is also the name behind Powerade sports drinks, Minute Made juices, Gold Peak tea, Dasani water, and more. It's got something to sell to everyone at any given time."", ""The 400 million shares of Coca-Cola Berkshire Hathaway's been holding since 2006 are worth a total of nearly $24 billion, by the way. That makes it Berkshire's fourth-biggest holding."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer cyclical sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Invest In.\xa0', 'Consumer cyclical companies produce goods and services that are considered non-essential or discretionary, meaning consumers are more likely to purchase them when they have extra income or feel confident about their financial situation. Consumer cyclical stocks include companies in sectors such as retail, automotive, travel and leisure, entertainment, and luxury goods.', ""Over the past year, we've seen clear evidence that consumers have remained strong despite challenges like high inflation, increasing interest rates, and greater recession concerns. This resilience notably buoyed the performance of stocks within the consumer discretionary sector, which includes businesses offering non-essential products and services such as apparel, automobiles, and accommodations. The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index ended 2023 with a total return of 42.41%, reporting one of its best years on record. In addition to the support from a strong consumer base, the stocks in this sector also gained from broader market trends that propelled the overall stock market higher in 2023. These trends included relief as the Federal Reserve signaled the potential end of its rate-hiking cycle as the year progressed. Furthermore, sector-level performance was boosted by specific issues affecting some of the largest companies within it. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), the two largest companies in the sector by a significant margin, have both seen remarkable gains in the past year, driven by the surge in mega-cap, tech-related stocks. Additionally, both companies are considered potential investment opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence."", ""After experiencing robust performance in 2023, analysts are also showing a preference for the sector in the current year. Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, stated that consumers' willingness to sustain moderate spending growth has been crucial for the economy. He suggested that this could be attributed, at least in part, to the robust labor market and notable wage increases. Based on a Fidelity report, the performance of sectors is expected to be influenced by broader economic factors in 2024. If inflation remains low and the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates, it could be advantageous for the sector, as consumers may be more inclined to buy expensive items like cars or homes. An even more positive scenario would be if the economy avoids a recession and job markets stay robust, which would particularly benefit this sector."", ""The report highlighted that following the sector's strong performance in 2023, stock valuations are not as low as they were previously. However, there are still segments of the market where the firm has identified robust long-term growth prospects, and where stocks are trading at attractive prices. One ongoing area of opportunity includes certain retailers. These companies possess defensive characteristics within their business models, offering some protection in case of a deteriorating economic outlook."", 'Another factor contributing to the positive outlook for the sector is that certain companies within it opt to distribute dividends when they maintain a steady cash flow and have a track record of sharing profits with shareholders. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) are some of the best consumer cyclical dividend stocks among others that are discussed below.', 'Image by Steve Buissinne from Pixabay', 'Our Methodology:', 'For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of Q4 2023 and selected consumer cyclical dividend stocks from the entertainment, technology, retail, housing, materials, and automotive industries.

Buffett does not believe in changing his investing strategies based on short-term market movements. Buffett said Berkshire\'s goal remains owning entire or parts of businesses which ""enjoy good economics that are fundamental and enduring.""', 'What caught the market\'s attention was Buffett\'s revelation that Berkshire\'s cash pile has soared to about $167.6 billion as of the end of 2023. But what was alarming in this figure was the reason why Buffett, who is always a fan of letting the money do the work, is not deploying this cash. Buffett said that there remain ""only a handful"" of companies that impress Berkshire in the US and outside the country there are ""essentially no candidates"" for capital deployment opportunities for Berkshire.', 'Buffett said to think that investors have gotten wiser over time would be a mistake. The billionaire said the constant availability of financial news and trading platforms have only made the investors ""active"" because of the ""casino-like"" behavior of the markets.', 'In his latest letter, Warren Buffett talked about how he likes to view ""market seizures"" as investing opportunities:', '""Occasionally, markets and/or the economy will cause stocks and bonds of some large and fundamentally good businesses to be strikingly mispriced. Indeed, markets can – and will – unpredictably seize up or even vanish as they did for four months in 1914 and for a few days in 2001. If you believe that American investors are now more stable than in the past, think back to September 2008. Speed of communication and the wonders of technology facilitate instant worldwide paralysis, and we have come a long way since smoke signals. Such instant panics won’t happen often – but they will happen. Berkshire’s ability to immediately respond to market seizures with both huge sums and certainty of performance may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity. Though the stock market is massively larger than it was in our early years, today’s active participants are neither more emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school. For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young.

That mantra is part of Buffett\'s long-term investment philosophy of investing in high-quality businesses run by strong management teams. ', ""While Buffett would love to hold all his stock forever, few stand the test of time. However, one stock Buffett sees as a potential forever holding is Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY). Here's a look at what Buffett had to say about the oil stock\xa0in Berkshire's latest annual letter to shareholders, as he likened it to his company's stakes in Coca-Cola and American Express."", 'Buffett wrote in his latest shareholder letter: ', 'This year, I would like to describe two other investments that we expect to maintain indefinitely. Like Coke and AmEx, these commitments are not huge relative to our resources. They are worthwhile, however, and we were able to increase both positions during 2023. ', ""Occidental was one of those investments Berkshire's investment in five very large Japanese companies was the other. "", 'In discussing Occidental, Buffett noted that Berkshire owned 27.8% of its outstanding shares at the end of last year. In addition, it owns warrants for five more years that give it ""the option to materially increase our ownership at a fixed price."" Berkshire received those warrants when it made a $10 billion preferred investment in Occidental in 2019 to help fund its purchase of rival Anadarko Petroleum. ', ""Buffett's company has received regulatory approval to buy up to half of Occidental Petroleum. That approval, combined with Berkshire's massive and growing cash position, has led to a lot of speculation that it might seek to buy the oil company. "", 'However, Buffett wrote, ""Though we very much like our ownership, as well as the option, Berkshire has no interest in purchasing or managing Occidental."" Instead of buying the whole company, Berkshire will probably continue adding to its Occidental position when it trades at an attractive price to steadily increase its ownership, potentially up to the 50% it has the approval to own. ', 'Buffett then highlighted the three factors driving his view that Occidental could be an indefinite holding: ""We particularly like its vast oil and gas holdings in the United States, as well as its leadership in carbon-capture initiatives, though the economic feasibility of this technique has yet to be proven. Both of these activities are very much in our country\'s interest.""', 'He noted that it wasn\'t that long ago that the U.S. was ""woefully dependent on foreign oil."" However, thanks to a significant improvement in the economics of shale drilling, the U.S. is now a major oil producer. That means OPEC isn\'t the dominant force it once was in the oil market, and Occidental is playing a key role. It has become a major oil producer, which is good for the country. ', ""Buffett also highlighted Occidental's leadership in carbon capture. The oil company has a long history of using carbon dioxide to coax more oil out of legacy fields by injecting it into oil reservoirs to increase pressure and production through a process known as enhanced oil recovery. It's now leveraging its expertise in injecting carbon dioxide to capitalize on the massive carbon capture and sequestration opportunity. It's developing a decarbonization business by building direct air capture facilities that pull the greenhouse gas out of the air. It's commercializing the technology, which, like its oil production, is good for the country (and the environment). "", ""While it's not an economically proven technology yet, it could be very good for Occidetnal's bottom line. Its CEO, Vicki Hollub, believes carbon capture and sequestration could become a $3 trillion to $5 trillion global market. That drives her belief that it could eventually make as much money from the technology as it currently does from producing oil and gas. "", ""Finally, Buffett highlighted Occidental's management team:"", ""Under Vicki Hollub's leadership, Occidental is doing the right things for both its country and its owners. No one knows what oil prices will do over the next month, year, or decade. But Vicki does know how to separate oil from rock, and that's an uncommon talent, valuable to her shareholders and to her country."", 'Buffett loves to invest in well-managed companies. That describes Occidental under the leadership of Vicki Hollub. She has been a good steward of the company, its oil resources that are crucial to the country, and now the environment by helping spearhead the commercialization of carbon capture technology.', ""Buffett's company has built a large position in Occidental Petroleum. While he has no plans to buy the entire company, he expects to hold the oil stock indefinitely because of its importance to the country and strong leadership. Occidental's large oil business and emerging carbon capture platform position it to grow value for shareholders, including Berkshire, in the future under the adept leadership of Vicki Hollub.

Over the past year, Vertex stock has climbed almost 50%. Now you may be wondering if, after those gains, it's too late to get in on this exciting biotech story. Well, I've got good news for you: It isn't. In fact, there are three reasons to load up on Vertex shares right now."", ""Vertex isn't done expanding beyond its CF specialty area. The biotech recently reported positive pivotal trial data on VX-548, a candidate to treat one of the most common problems around: pain. Vertex aims to file a regulatory submission by midyear, so if all goes smoothly, we could be looking at a new -- and significant -- revenue opportunity in the near term."", ""VX-548 is a non-opioid pain candidate, acting on a sodium channel that plays a key role in pain signaling. This potential treatment could be big because, today, pain treatment options are limited. Over-the-counter medications often aren't strong enough, and prescription opioids carry the risk of addiction. VX-548 could fill the gap, offering patients a compelling option -- and eventually reach peak annual revenue of at least $5 billion, according to analyst forecasts."", 'Vertex hopes to win regulatory approval with a broad moderate-to-severe acute pain label and in the future gain approval in chronic pain, too. So, this could be a key growth product for the biotech.', 'Vertex sells a portfolio of therapies that have improved the quality of life and extended the lives of CF patients. And this portfolio is led by blockbuster Trikafta, which helped Vertex generate more than $9.8 billion in revenue last year.', 'But there may be competition ahead, and this competition comes right out of Vertex\'s laboratories. The company recently reported pivotal trial data for a candidate known as ""the vanza triple,"" a therapy that tops even the superstar Trikafta. In trials, it did a better job than Trikafta at lowering sweat chloride levels in CF patients. These levels are typically high in those with CF because these patients have trouble clearing chloride from the cells.', 'The vanza triple is a once-daily pill compared to the twice-daily Trikafta regimen, making it a more attractive option.', ""Trikafta's patent implies CF dominance through 2037, but if the vanza triple wins regulatory approval, investors could expect an even longer period of leadership in this billion-dollar market. Vertex plans to file for regulatory review by the middle of this year."", ""As mentioned above, Vertex shares have climbed, even touching a record high in recent weeks. In spite of the gains, though, Vertex's valuation still looks reasonable -- the stock trades for 25x forward earnings estimates -- considering its near-term revenue growth drivers, mentioned above, and long-term prospects."", ""It's important to remember the new potential products for pain and CF, as well as Casgevy, could drive significant revenue growth for a number of years. And today's valuation, even based on forward earnings estimates, doesn't take all of that into account."", 'As for the coming five years, Wall Street predicts the company will deliver double-digit annual growth.', ""All of this means that right now, even after the stock's gains and even as it trades close to record high levels, Vertex remains a bargain for the long-term investor. And that's a great reason to buy this top biotech like there's no tomorrow."", 'Where to invest $1,000 right now', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

The company recently earned approval for its first product, Casgevy, a gene-editing therapy for a couple of rare blood diseases. Developed in collaboration with biotech giant Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Casgevy should have massive commercial success. CRISPR and Vertex estimate a total patient population of at least 35,000, and the treatment costs $2.2 million per patient in the U.S. Even grabbing just 30% of that target market would mean billions of dollars in revenue. There aren't many competitors to contend with, either, so things are looking good for CRISPR and Vertex."", ""CRISPR Therapeutics gained substantial prominence thanks to this regulatory nod, because the biotech focuses on developing CRISPR-based therapies.

Last year, Axsome Therapeutics' revenue came in at about $270 million, much better than the roughly $50 million reported in 2022."", ""Meanwhile, Auvelity is being tested in Alzheimer's disease agitation (aggressive and restless symptoms) and should soon start a pivotal study in smoking cessation. Sunosi will soon kick off late-stage studies in depression, binge eating disorder, and shift work sleep disorder (disruptions in sleep rhythms caused by unconventional working hours); it has an ongoing late-stage study targeting ADHD."", ""And there's more good news: Axsome has a rich late-stage pipeline that should yield more clinical and regulatory wins in the next few years.

However, the drugmaker has been dealing with slow or nonexistent revenue growth due to competition.', ""The biotech has a plan to turn things around. It's developing new therapies, and this includes the highly promising weight-loss area. Sales of anti-obesity drugs are projected to skyrocket in the coming years, and Amgen hopes to capture a piece of this market. Amgen also acquired Horizon Therapeutics for $28 billion last year, a move that significantly expanded its lineup and pipeline."", ""Furthermore, the drugmaker has been making a push in the biosimilars market, another promising industry considering that most people think prescription drugs are too expensive.

The key themes of Buffett\'s letter were similar to what they are every year, and understandably so. Buffett does not believe in changing his investing strategies based on short-term market movements. Buffett said Berkshire\'s goal remains owning entire or parts of businesses which ""enjoy good economics that are fundamental and enduring.""', 'What caught the market\'s attention was Buffett\'s revelation that Berkshire\'s cash pile has soared to about $167.6 billion as of the end of 2023. But what was alarming in this figure was the reason why Buffett, who is always a fan of letting the money do the work, is not deploying this cash. Buffett said that there remain ""only a handful"" of companies that impress Berkshire in the US and outside the country there are ""essentially no candidates"" for capital deployment opportunities for Berkshire.', 'Buffett said to think that investors have gotten wiser over time would be a mistake.

Indeed, markets can – and will – unpredictably seize up or even vanish as they did for four months in 1914 and for a few days in 2001. If you believe that American investors are now more stable than in the past, think back to September 2008. Speed of communication and the wonders of technology facilitate instant worldwide paralysis, and we have come a long way since smoke signals. Such instant panics won’t happen often – but they will happen. Berkshire’s ability to immediately respond to market seizures with both huge sums and certainty of performance may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity. Though the stock market is massively larger than it was in our early years, today’s active participants are neither more emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school. For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young.

He once stated, ""When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.""', ""However, Buffett doesn't hold forever every stock he buys. There's a good bit of churn in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. But the legendary investor has identified a handful of Berkshire's holdings that he believes are forever stocks. Buffett just revealed the eight stocks that he thinks Berkshire Hathaway will likely hold forever -- and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) wasn't one of them."", 'In his letter written to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year, Buffett discussed two long-term holdings -- American Express (NYSE: AXP) and The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO). He noted that Berkshire completed building big positions in both stocks in the mid-1990s after several years of buying.', 'American Express and Coca-Cola have been massive winners for Buffett and Berkshire. In his letter written last year, he used them to make an important point: ""The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders.""', 'Buffett mentioned AmEx and Coca-Cola again in his most recent letter to Berkshire shareholders, which was released on Saturday. He emphasized the lesson from these two purchases: ""When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it.""', 'In his latest shareholder letter, Buffett added other stocks that he said Berkshire ""expect[s] to maintain indefinitely."" The first new addition to the list was Occidental Petroleum (NYSE: OXY).', ""Berkshire has been buying Occidental shares hand over fist. At the end of 2023, the conglomerate's stake in the company stood at 27.8%. It's now the sixth-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio."", 'Buffett stressed that Berkshire doesn\'t have any intention of fully acquiring Occidental or gaining control of the oil and gas producer. However, he said that ""we very much like our ownership,"" along with the option to increase Berkshire\'s position.', 'There are two things about Occidental that Buffett especially likes. First, the company has extensive oil and gas operations in the U.S. Second, Occidental is a leader in carbon capture.', 'Although Buffett acknowledged that the technology is still unproven, he argued that it, along with Occidental\'s large oil and gas holdings, ""are very much in our country\'s interest.""', ""Buffett discussed the other five stocks that he believes Berkshire will hold practically forever as a group, rather than individually. They're the five huge Japanese trading houses:"", 'Itochu (OTC: ITOCF) (OTC: ITOCY)', 'Marubeni (OTC: MARUY)', 'Mitsui (OTC: MITSF) (OTC: MITSY)', 'Mitsubishi (OTC: MSBHF)', 'Sumitomo (OTC: SSUM.F) (OTC: SSUM.Y)', ""Berkshire currently owns stakes of roughly 9% in each of these Japanese companies. Buffett noted that the conglomerate has committed that it wouldn't increase its ownership in any of them beyond 9.9%."", 'What does Buffett like about these five companies? For one thing, he mentioned that each of them ""operates in a highly diversified manner somewhat similar to the way Berkshire itself is run."" He likes the Japanese companies\' policies that are beneficial to shareholders, including smart stock buybacks. Buffett also stated that the investments could open the door for Berkshire to partner with the companies down the road.', ""Apple remains Berkshire's largest holding, by far. Buffett didn't list the tech giant in his list of stocks that Berkshire would hold forever. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Berkshire even trimmed its position in Apple."", ""Does this mean that Buffett doesn't view Apple as a forever kind of stock? I don't think so."", ""For one thing, it's important to remember that Buffett only focuses on a small number of specific Berkshire holdings in each shareholder letter. He didn't discuss Occidental (except for one brief mention), Itochu, Marubeni, Mitsui, Mitsubishi, or Sumitomo in last year's letter, even though Berkshire owned all of these stocks then."", 'In May 2023 at Berkshire\'s shareholder meeting, Buffett stated that Apple ""is a better business than any we own."" Again, all eight of the stocks that he indicated he thinks Berkshire will own indefinitely were in Berkshire\'s portfolio when he made that statement.', ""The bottom line is that we shouldn't assume that there aren't other stocks in addition to American Express, Coca-Cola, Occidental, and the five Japanese trading-house stocks that Berkshire will hold for decades to come. I'd bet that if Buffett were asked to name the full list, Apple would be on it -- and probably several other stocks, too."", 'Should you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?', 'Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO)."", 'Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.', ' View our latest analysis for Coca-Cola ', 'Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:', ""Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity"", 'So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Coca-Cola is:', '39% = US$11b ÷ US$27b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.39 in profit."", ""By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. As is clear from the image below, Coca-Cola has a better ROE than the average (16%) in the Beverage industry."", ""That's what we like to see. With that said, a high ROE doesn't always indicate high profitability. Aside from changes in net income, a high ROE can also be the outcome of high debt relative to equity, which indicates risk."", ""Virtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from issuing shares, retained earnings, or debt. In the case of the first and second options, the ROE will reflect this use of cash, for growth. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same."", ""Coca-Cola does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.57. There's no doubt the ROE is impressive, but it's worth keeping in mind that the metric could have been lower if the company were to reduce its debt. Investors should think carefully about how a company might perform if it was unable to borrow so easily, because credit markets do change over time."", ""Return on equity is one way we can compare its business quality of different companies. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE."", 'But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.', 'If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.', 'Have feedback on this article?

More often than not, you can buy a stock owned by Berkshire and safely plan on staying in the position for years on end."", ""To this end, here's a rundown of three stocks Warren Buffett has steered Berkshire Hathaway into that would also be at home in most investors' portfolios."", 'Credit card company Capital One is planning on acquiring rival Discover. If the merger is allowed to happen, it certainly seems to pose a threat to American Express (NYSE: AXP). But that potential threat may not be anywhere near as dire as it seems to be on the surface.', ""While American Express is a credit card company, it's dramatically different than its credit card peers. It would be more accurate to describe its business model as the management of perks and rewards programs that just happen to revolve around charge cards."", ""Individuals and business alike will pay as much as $695 per year for the right to use an American Express card simply because cardholders receive credit toward air travel tickets, rebates on certain forms of at-home entertainment, spendable credits at a handful of retailers, bonus hotel-stay time, cash back on grocery purchases, and more. Other card companies offer perks, but none of those rival programs hold a candle to American Express'."", 'The company not only generates fee-based revenue each and every year, of course, but also collects interest payments as well as a small portion of each card-based transaction it facilitates. This is why the company has been such a reliable grower for years now despite plenty of competition.', ""It's also worth noting that American Express' clientele tends to be more affluent than average, which means its customers are less likely to become delinquent on their payments or outright default on their loans."", ""In this vein, while higher interest rates and a challenging economy are now leading lenders to report bigger write-downs, American Express' past-dues and write-offs are holding more or less level. Ironically, this stock could be a relative safe haven should the economy continue to weaken."", ""Berkshire Hathaway is holding nearly 152 million shares of American Express, by the way -- a position it's been sitting on since 2006. It's also Berkshire's third-biggest holding, if that tells you anything."", ""American Express may account for a significant chunk of the Berkshire Hathaway stock portfolio, but it's a distant third to the fund's single-biggest position. That honor belongs to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). This $174 billion trade makes up half of Berkshire's holdings in publicly traded companies."", ""There's no denying the iPhone maker's very best days may be in the rearview mirror. Last quarter's top line was up a modest 2% year over year, bouncing back only a bit from the 3% revenue lull reported for the fiscal year ended in September. iPhone revenue remains relatively stagnant, and IDC reports that unit sales of iPhones have actually been declining for over a year now. Given that the popular smartphone makes up over half of Apple's business, this trend is more than a little concerning."", ""The company is pivoting, though. Take its services arm as an example. Sales of apps and digital content are now the organization's second-biggest business. And, while still miles behind the iPhone in terms of the total amount of operating profit it produces, Apple's operating profit margins on its services business are ridiculously high at 70% of its revenue. Indeed, this division now accounts for roughly one-third of the company's bottom line. As this services unit grows, it's going to make an oversized impact on Apple's overall net income."", ""It's not just the ongoing growth of its services business keeping Buffett and his acolytes on board with Apple. The company's finally venturing into other businesses lines that mesh well with its existing technologies. For instance, it's reinventing its voice-activated assistant Siri now that artificial intelligence is making such tools wildly useful. Its recently launched Vision Pro goggles represent the next step in the evolution of augmented reality as well, even if it's not yet perfectly clear how this tech can be best monetized."", ""The point is, Apple's got several different levers it can pull here even if the iPhone itself has peaked."", 'Last but not least, add The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE: KO) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks you may want to consider buying for yourself.', ""It's not a complicated, sexy pick. But that's kind of the point. When you own a stake in Coca-Cola, you own a piece of a cash-generating juggernaut that's easy to defend. This cash is then turned into dividends, which have not only been paid like clockwork every quarter for decades, but have now been raised in each of the past 62 years. There are only a handful of companies out there that can make the same (or better) claim."", ""The secret to Coca-Cola's success? There are three of them actually, although they're not exactly secrets. The first of these is Coca-Cola's ability to build and maintain brands that consumers love and purchase without even thinking about it. More than mere marketing, Coca-Cola is part of a lifestyle, and even part of the global culture."", ""The second pillar of The Coca-Cola Company's consistent success is its business model. It's not quite what you may think it is. It's never actually bottled all of its products, and in recent years it's done very little of its own bottling. Rather, its core business is selling concentrated flavor syrups to bottlers that then take on the burden -- and the inconsistent costs -- of producing the products you find placed in stores."", 'This model is a much more consistent one than bottling itself, since the cost of creating and handling these syrups is minimal compared to the labor-intensive and input-intensive process of creating the final products that consumers buy.', ""Finally, while you certainly know the company's namesake cola, The Coca-Cola Company is far more diversified than you might realize. In addition to familiar sodas like Sprite and Fanta, Coca-Cola is also the name behind Powerade sports drinks, Minute Made juices, Gold Peak tea, Dasani water, and more. It's got something to sell to everyone at any given time."", ""The 400 million shares of Coca-Cola Berkshire Hathaway's been holding since 2006 are worth a total of nearly $24 billion, by the way.

Despite the unpleasant nature of dirty work, research suggests that job satisfaction can thrive even in these environments. Deery, Kolar, and Walsh delved into the mechanisms behind this phenomenon, revealing that reframing the meaning of work, autonomy, relationships among workers, and task variety play pivotal roles. Workers redefine their roles positively, finding pride in their abilities and the meaningful connections forged with colleagues. Autonomy, particularly at the group level, fosters a sense of control and satisfaction, while strong work relationships offer support and security, transcending the workplace into personal life.\xa0', 'This study prompts organizations to reconsider their approach to job satisfaction, especially in socially marginalized work contexts. It focuses on the active role workers play in shaping their environment and highlights the significance of supportive structures within workplaces.\xa0', 'Nevertheless, the transition from ""dirty"" jobs to green ones in the United States has shown promising growth, with a tenfold increase observed between 2005 and 2021. Despite this progress, less than 1% of workers leaving carbon-intensive industries shift to low-carbon sector roles like renewable energy production or electric vehicle manufacturing. Data from the National Bureau of Economic Research highlights that most workers transitioning from dirty jobs end up in similar roles, perpetuating carbon-intensive practices. The study, analyzing over 130 million job profiles, underscores the challenge of effecting widespread change in the labor market amid climate concerns.To read more about green jobs, see the Fastest Growing Green Jobs in the World.', ""Certain demographics exhibit higher propensities for transitioning to green jobs, notably younger workers and those with bachelor's degrees.

In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period.

In this calculation we've used 6.7%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.962. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole.

The key themes of Buffett\'s letter were similar to what they are every year, and understandably so. Buffett does not believe in changing his investing strategies based on short-term market movements. Buffett said Berkshire\'s goal remains owning entire or parts of businesses which ""enjoy good economics that are fundamental and enduring.""', 'What caught the market\'s attention was Buffett\'s revelation that Berkshire\'s cash pile has soared to about $167.6 billion as of the end of 2023. But what was alarming in this figure was the reason why Buffett, who is always a fan of letting the money do the work, is not deploying this cash. Buffett said that there remain ""only a handful"" of companies that impress Berkshire in the US and outside the country there are ""essentially no candidates"" for capital deployment opportunities for Berkshire.', 'Buffett said to think that investors have gotten wiser over time would be a mistake. The billionaire said the constant availability of financial news and trading platforms have only made the investors ""active"" because of the ""casino-like"" behavior of the markets.', 'In his latest letter, Warren Buffett talked about how he likes to view ""market seizures"" as investing opportunities:', '""Occasionally, markets and/or the economy will cause stocks and bonds of some large and fundamentally good businesses to be strikingly mispriced. Indeed, markets can – and will – unpredictably seize up or even vanish as they did for four months in 1914 and for a few days in 2001. If you believe that American investors are now more stable than in the past, think back to September 2008. Speed of communication and the wonders of technology facilitate instant worldwide paralysis, and we have come a long way since smoke signals. Such instant panics won’t happen often – but they will happen. Berkshire’s ability to immediately respond to market seizures with both huge sums and certainty of performance may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity. Though the stock market is massively larger than it was in our early years, today’s active participants are neither more emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school. For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young. The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants.""', 'Methodology', ""For this article we scanned Warren Buffett's Q4'2023 portfolio and chose his top 12 stock picks.

The key themes of Buffett\'s letter were similar to what they are every year, and understandably so. Buffett does not believe in changing his investing strategies based on short-term market movements. Buffett said Berkshire\'s goal remains owning entire or parts of businesses which ""enjoy good economics that are fundamental and enduring.""', 'What caught the market\'s attention was Buffett\'s revelation that Berkshire\'s cash pile has soared to about $167.6 billion as of the end of 2023. But what was alarming in this figure was the reason why Buffett, who is always a fan of letting the money do the work, is not deploying this cash. Buffett said that there remain ""only a handful"" of companies that impress Berkshire in the US and outside the country there are ""essentially no candidates"" for capital deployment opportunities for Berkshire.', 'Buffett said to think that investors have gotten wiser over time would be a mistake. The billionaire said the constant availability of financial news and trading platforms have only made the investors ""active"" because of the ""casino-like"" behavior of the markets.', 'In his latest letter, Warren Buffett talked about how he likes to view ""market seizures"" as investing opportunities:', '""Occasionally, markets and/or the economy will cause stocks and bonds of some large and fundamentally good businesses to be strikingly mispriced. Indeed, markets can – and will – unpredictably seize up or even vanish as they did for four months in 1914 and for a few days in 2001. If you believe that American investors are now more stable than in the past, think back to September 2008. Speed of communication and the wonders of technology facilitate instant worldwide paralysis, and we have come a long way since smoke signals. Such instant panics won’t happen often – but they will happen. Berkshire’s ability to immediately respond to market seizures with both huge sums and certainty of performance may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity. Though the stock market is massively larger than it was in our early years, today’s active participants are neither more emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school. For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young. The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants.""', 'Methodology', ""For this article we scanned Warren Buffett's Q4'2023 portfolio and chose his top 12 stock picks.

In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook.

The utilities might have been affected due to warmer-than-normal weather patterns in most of the fourth quarter. However, new utility rates implemented in the service territories and customer growth are likely to have boosted profits.', ""Utilities continue to make prudent capital expenditures that reduce operating, fuel, maintenance and upkeep expenses. As a result, customers benefit from saving money on their utility costs. Utilities have reduced costs while simultaneously improving overall operations and efficiency through digital technology investments, crucial system connections and data-driven decision-making.Various positive aspects, such as new electric tariffs, customer additions, cost control and the execution of energy-efficiency initiatives, continue to benefit utilities. Also, the ongoing investments to further improve the resiliency of electric infrastructure against extreme weather conditions and the transition to cost-effective, renewable energy sources to produce electricity are expected to have benefited the power industry.Most of the utility companies have pledged to deliver 100% clean energy and achieve the zero-emission target in the coming years. As a result, these companies have been reducing their use of coal and other polluting sources in their generating portfolios and increasing the use of clean, renewable energy sources in their production portfolios.Still-high interest rate environment that remained in the United States during the fourth quarter is likely to have caused higher borrowing expenses for the capital-intensive utilities. As a result, increased interest expenses might have had a negative impact on the sector's profitability.Fourth-quarter weather patterns were warmer than normal for most of the fourth quarter across the service territories, with below-average precipitation. In November, some of the regions experienced snowfall. Overall, the weather is expected to have had a moderate effect on utilities' fourth-quarter top-line performance."", ""According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings beat.

GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with CINF.', ""On February 26, 2024, Cincinnati Financial Corp (NASDAQ:CINF) filed its annual 10-K report, revealing a comprehensive overview of its operations and financial health. As a property and casualty insurance company, CINF has demonstrated a strong financial performance, with a solid market capitalization of approximately $14.99 billion as of June 30, 2023. The company's insurance operations, including commercial lines, personal lines, and excess and surplus lines, along with life insurance and investments, have contributed to a diversified revenue stream. The financial tables within the filing indicate a robust balance sheet, with a fixed-maturity portfolio valued at $13.791 billion and an equity portfolio of $10.989 billion as of December 31, 2023. This financial overview sets the stage for a detailed SWOT analysis, providing investors with a clear picture of CINF's strategic positioning."", ""Financial Stability and Capital Management: Cincinnati Financial Corp's financial stability is a cornerstone of its competitive advantage. The company's insurer financial strength ratings reflect a strong capital and surplus position, which instills confidence among policyholders, agents, and shareholders. With a diversified investment portfolio, CINF maintains a fixed-maturity portfolio that exceeds total insurance reserves, showcasing an average rating of A2/A. This financial prudence is further evidenced by a debt-to-total-capital ratio of a mere 6.3% at year-end 2023, indicating a conservative approach to leveraging and a strong liquidity position with $4.907 billion held at the parent-company level."", ""Agency-Centric Business Model: CINF's commitment to its professional independent insurance agencies is a significant strength. The company's business model focuses on supporting the success of these agencies, which in turn actively market CINF's insurance products within their communities. This approach has allowed CINF to establish a 4.6% share of the standard lines property casualty insurance market through its reporting agency locations, according to 2022 data. The model promotes localized decision-making and superior service, particularly in claims, which enhances customer satisfaction and loyalty."", ""Technological Advancements: While CINF has made strides in implementing technology and analytics to improve pricing accuracy and underwriting profit, there is an ongoing need to further develop and integrate cutting-edge technology. The insurance industry is rapidly evolving with the advent of insurtech and digital platforms, and CINF's future competitiveness will depend on its ability to keep pace with these technological advancements and meet the changing expectations of consumers and agents."", ""Market Diversification: Although CINF has a strong presence in the property and casualty insurance market, there is a potential weakness in the concentration of its business lines. Expanding into new markets or diversifying product offerings could mitigate risks associated with market fluctuations and regulatory changes. Additionally, the company's reliance on independent agencies, while a strength, could also pose a risk if market trends shift towards direct-to-consumer models or if there is significant consolidation within the agency market."", 'Product and Service Expansion: CINF has the opportunity to expand its product lines and services to meet emerging market demands. For instance, the growing cyber insurance market presents a potential area for growth, given the increasing prevalence of cyber threats. By leveraging its financial strength and agency relationships, CINF can develop and offer new insurance products that cater to evolving risks, thereby capturing additional market share.', ""Strategic Partnerships and Acquisitions: The company's solid financial position enables it to pursue strategic partnerships or acquisitions that can enhance its market presence and operational capabilities. Collaborations with insurtech firms or acquisitions of specialized underwriters could provide CINF with access to innovative technologies and expertise, further strengthening its competitive position in the market."", ""Economic and Regulatory Challenges: CINF operates in a highly regulated industry that is sensitive to economic cycles. Economic downturns, elevated inflation, or changes in regulatory environments could impact the demand for insurance products and affect the company's profitability. Additionally, legislative changes or increased regulatory scrutiny could impose new obligations that increase expenses or restrict business practices."", 'Competitive Landscape: The insurance industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid innovation. CINF faces the threat of losing market share to competitors that may offer more advanced technological solutions or more aggressive pricing strategies. The company must continuously innovate and adapt to maintain its competitive advantages and market position.', 'In conclusion, Cincinnati Financial Corp (NASDAQ:CINF) exhibits a strong financial foundation and a unique agency-centric business model that positions it well within the insurance industry. However, the company must address its technological advancements and market diversification to stay competitive. Opportunities for growth through product expansion and strategic initiatives are abundant, but CINF must navigate economic uncertainties and a dynamic competitive landscape.

Wind energy projects struggled with rising costs for materials, labor, and capital, as well as delays in interconnection, permits, and transmission. However, there was some relief in the supply chain as new clean energy and climate laws came into effect. Federal investments in clean energy and increasing demand for decarbonization from both public and private sectors are driving forces for renewables. These factors are expected to help renewables overcome obstacles in 2024 to meet climate targets, as per Deloitte. 2024 is expected to see varying speeds of growth across renewable technologies, industries, and markets.

Onshore wind will see significant investment as well, although at a slower growth rate.

Solar and battery costs have already dropped significantly since 2022 and are expected to fall below 2020 levels in 2024. While solar and battery manufacturers have enjoyed healthy margins, they are expected to face lower margins in the coming years. Downstream players, such as distributors and installers, may face challenges due to high inventories and declining prices. The oversupply and decreasing raw material prices in solar modules and batteries led to a price war in the second half of 2023, with further market consolidation expected in 2024. The global wind turbine supply market is historically divided between Chinese manufacturers serving the domestic market and Western firms catering to the rest of the world.\xa0', ""On a more positive note, one of the key commitments from COP28 is to triple global renewables capacity by 2030 to 11 terawatts.

Furthermore, the company's entry into homeowners insurance through acquisition demonstrates its proactive approach to expanding its product offerings and tapping into new revenue streams."", ""Operational Complexity: As Progressive Corp grows and diversifies its offerings, managing operational complexity becomes a challenge. The company's reliance on third-party systems, including cloud computing environments, increases the risk of system failures or data breaches. Additionally, the complexity of insurance products and the need for continuous innovation can strain resources and potentially lead to inefficiencies. Progressive must navigate these complexities to maintain its competitive advantage and ensure the delivery of high-quality products and customer experiences."", ""Dependence on Economic Conditions: The insurance industry is sensitive to economic conditions, and Progressive Corp is no exception. Factors such as unemployment rates and vehicle sales directly impact the demand for insurance products.

Progressive Corp faces competition from both traditional insurers and new entrants, including insurtech startups that may offer innovative products or lower prices. To maintain its competitive position, Progressive must continuously invest in marketing, technology, and product development, which can strain financial resources and impact profitability.', ""Regulatory Changes: Insurance companies operate in a heavily regulated environment, and Progressive Corp is subject to various federal and state regulations. Changes in laws or regulations can have a significant impact on the company's operations, requiring adjustments to business practices and potentially leading to increased costs. Moreover, any non-compliance with regulatory requirements can result in fines, reputational damage, and legal challenges, posing a threat to Progressive's business."", ""In conclusion, Progressive Corp (NYSE:PGR) exhibits a strong market position with a well-recognized brand and a diverse product portfolio, which are key strengths in the competitive insurance industry. However, the company must navigate operational complexities and remain vigilant to economic fluctuations that could impact its business. Opportunities for growth through technological innovation and market expansion present exciting prospects for Progressive. Nevertheless, the company must be strategic in addressing competitive pressures and regulatory changes that pose potential threats. Overall, Progressive's strategic initiatives and robust financial foundation position it to leverage its strengths and capitalize on opportunities while effectively managing its weaknesses and threats."", 'This article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

The dividend payout ratio provides insights into the portion of earnings the company distributes as dividends.

Traders are enthusiastic, but some analysts are warning of a potential market bubble. In fact, if the Federal Reserve fails to deliver anticipated rate cuts, the market could be in for a significant correction. But fear not. For investors with a greater time horizon, there are still plenty of great opportunities at present. These seven long-term stocks to buy off solid value and are set to outperform the market.', 'That’s not just me saying it. All seven of these leading long-term stocks are Morningstar 5-star stock selections, meaning they are among the most undervalued stocks that the firm’s analysts see in the marketplace. Let’s dive into these top long-term stocks to own right now.', 'Source: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com', 'JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) has almost entirely missed out in the recovery so far.', 'InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips', 'Many American tech and e-commerce companies are back at or near their all-time highs. Meanwhile, JD shares are going for around $25 each, which is more than 75% below the highs set back during the pandemic-era online shopping boom. Indeed, JD stock is trading back around its IPO price from a decade ago.', 'Despite the collapse in its share value, however, JD’s business is stronger than ever. Revenues have nearly doubled since 2019 and profits are up a lot more as the company has focused on efficiency. In fact, shares are going for around eight times forward earnings and offers an agreeable 2.6% dividend yield as well. And recent quarterly results have maintained the positive momentum.', 'It’s easy to come up with a laundry list of risk factors for the Chinese economy and tech sector right now. But if and when things do go right for the local economy, JD shares should skyrocket.', 'Source: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com', 'Another one of the top long-term stocks to own, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) has seen an unceremonious collapse in its share price. The pharma giant’s stock plunged from a peak of $60 in 2021 to less than half that now. Today, PFE stock sells for far less than it did in January 2020, long before anyone had started thinking about COVID-19 vaccines.', 'And sure, the vaccines aren’t generating the sorts of revenues now that they did in 2021 and 2022.', 'But Pfizer’s revenues are still far higher today than they were before the pandemic. Pfizer has reinvested a chunk of its vaccine windfall into its pipeline, and has a variety of other potential blockbuster drugs on the way.', 'Morningstar’s Damien Conover sees tremendous value in PFE stock; he believes shares are worth $42 each compared to their $27 share price at present. In addition, the stock yields more than 6%, making PFE shares a great long-term growth and income pick.', 'Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com', 'PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a formative part of the worldwide e-commerce landscape. Since the early days of online shopping, PayPal has been a trusted check-out option and provider of various services to online merchants.', 'Over the years, PayPal has gone into adjacent fields such as shopping apps and mobile wallets. While there is plenty of competition emerging, PayPal has done an admirable job of building out its ecosystem to react to the changing consumer landscape.', 'Regardless, investors have dumped most of the payment stocks, PayPal included. Shares trade for a mere fraction of where they were back in 2021 during the e-commerce boom. Yet, PayPal’s profits and revenues continue to grow. At less than 12 times forward earnings, PYPL stock is a steal and is another one of the top long-term stocks to own.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) is associated with the cigarette business. And cigarettes are understandably in dramatic long-term decline due to their considerable negative health impacts.', 'However, British American Tobacco isn’t sitting idly by. The company has invested more heavily than almost all other tobacco companies to reinvent itself from the inside. British American now aims to be the worldwide leader in nicotine in any form, be it heated not burned products, vaping, or other such safer delivery platforms.', 'British American Tobacco recently took a $31.5 billion writedown on its cigarette business. That shouldn’t be too surprising, as the value of those brands does in fact seem to be impaired. However, the future is in BTI’s safer nicotine alternatives. Meanwhile, the overall business is dirt cheap at less than seven times forward earnings while giving off a 9.5% dividend yield.', 'Source: Shutterstock', 'Realty Income (NYSE:O) is a\xa0triple net lease\xa0REIT, which is a type of rental arrangement where the tenants — rather than the landlord — pay for key expenses such as maintenance and utilities. This arrangement has served Realty Income well during the recent inflationary period as it is sheltered from some rising costs that have plagued other landlords.', 'Regardless, most REITs, including Realty Income, have underperformed amid the current macroeconomic situation. Higher interest rates are a double whammy for REITs; it costs more to pay debt on the REIT’s buildings, and investors demand higher yields from their dividend stocks as the rates on risk-free alternatives rise.', 'All this has led O stock to fall well below fair value. Morningstar’s Kevin Brown believes the stock is worth $76/share today, whereas O stock currently trades for just $52. Brown believes Realty Income’s property portfolio is undervalued and that the REIT continues to have promising opportunities to acquire more buildings and expand its portfolio.', 'Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.com', 'Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) is one of the world’s leading cosmetic companies. It sells a vast array of beauty products around the globe and has marketing channels across various demographics and price points.', 'Normally, Estee Lauder has shown steady strong growth throughout the years. However, the firm’s results have lost their shine over the past 24 months.', 'There have been rapid changes in consumer demand in the cosmetics space as a result of the pandemic. Demand initially topped expectations as the global economy reopened.', 'But this demand proved short-lived and retailed ended up with too much unwanted inventory. A brutal downturn in the Asian market has hit Estee Lauder especially hard. At one point, EL stock was down close to 75% from its all-time highs as investors feared the absolute worst.', 'However, EL stock is now on the mend. The company’s most recent earnings report was well ahead of expectations and shares are rallying. Still, the stock is down by more than half from its 2021 peak, making this a great entry point for a leading long-term stock to own.', 'Source: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com', 'JD.com isn’t the only Chinese stock offering deep value today. In fact, there are quite a few Chinese names selling far below their apparent fair values.', 'Of the bunch, Yum China (NYSE:YUMC) offers the most compelling outlook today. That’s because Yum China is not overly tied to the economy or political developments. It is the Chinese franchisor for fast food brands including KFC, Taco Bell, and Pizza Hut. Geopolitical challenges should have less impact on the fast-food market as compared to say real estate, e-commerce, or technology firms.', 'Regardless, due to broader macroeconomic concerns, YUMC stock has fallen more than 30% over the past year. This has pushed the company down to just 19 times forward earnings. That is a bargain for a company that is growing both revenues and earnings per share around 10% annually even during this Chinese economic slump.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks in the S&P 500 and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks To Invest In 2024.\xa0', 'In 2023, despite the presence of higher interest rates, consumers remained unfazed, and investors displayed more optimism than apprehension, largely fueled by the excitement surrounding advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Consequently, the S&P 500 experienced a remarkable surge, gaining over 24% last year. This surge was primarily attributed to the dominance of what has been dubbed the ""Magnificent Seven."" These seven major companies, which include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), played a pivotal role in driving the S&P 500\'s performance, contributing significantly to its overall returns. On the flip side, a staggering 72% of stocks failed to match the performance of the S&P 500 index, setting a new record for underperformance. Additionally, dividend-paying stocks experienced a downturn in 2023, paving the way for the dominance of technology equities. Despite this, the stock market returns throughout the year were both exceptional and notably robust in comparison to historical trends.', 'Despite their recent lackluster performance, dividends remain a crucial aspect of returns for equity investors and have garnered considerable attention in capital markets research. The appeal of dividend-paying stocks is substantial, and rightfully so as they have the potential to significantly enhance long-term investment outcomes. This general observation has been well-documented across various periods and global markets. For instance, one study analyzed the components contributing to total equity returns of U.S. stocks spanning from 1802 to 2002. It revealed that dividends, along with real growth in dividends, constituted a substantial portion, accounting for 5.8% of the total annualized return of 7.9% over 200 years. Another study, conducted from a global perspective by researchers at the London Business School, examined data from 1900 to 2005 across 17 countries. It found that the real return averaged around 5%, with an average dividend yield of 4.5% during that timeframe. These findings provide compelling evidence for the significance of dividends for long-term investors.', ""Yet another report from S&P Dow Jones Indices provided insight into the enduring impact of dividend-paying equities over the long term. This report emphasized that since 1926, dividends have played a significant role, contributing roughly 32% of the total return for the S&P 500, with capital appreciations making up the remaining 68%. Hence, both sustainable dividend income and the potential for capital appreciation are key considerations for forming expectations regarding total returns. Furthermore, the growth of dividends proves to be beneficial for investors. Over an extended period, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which monitors the performance of companies with 25 or more consecutive years of dividend growth, has surpassed the S&P 500 index while exhibiting lower volatility, indicating higher risk-adjusted returns. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats' ability to mitigate losses can be observed through its upside and downside capture ratios. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, it has outperformed the S&P 500 in down months 69.34% of the time and in up months 43.61% of the time from December 29, 1989, to July 31, 2023. Additionally, it's worth noting that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats experienced lower drawdown levels compared to the benchmark index."", ""Considering these points, let's explore some of the top S&P 500 dividend-paying stocks."", 'Image by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay', 'Our Methodology: ', 'To create this list, we first examined the S&P 500 stocks based on their weight in the index and picked the top 25 stocks that consistently distribute dividends to their shareholders.

If you want to skip and jump directly to the top countries on our list, you can go to 5 countries with declining birth rates in 2024.', 'The global birth rate issue is a critical concern impacting countries worldwide. Over the past 70 years, there has been a significant decrease in birth rates across the nations. This trend is particularly evident in countries like China and South Korea, where birth rates have plummeted by over 80% since 1950. The decline in birth rates is a complex phenomenon with both positive and negative implications.', 'On the positive side, it signifies progress in socio-economic development. As countries advance and living standards improve, societal norms shift towards prioritizing education, career, and personal goals over starting families. This shift is empowered by factors such as enhanced opportunities for women, urbanization, and access to family planning services.', 'However, the downside of declining birth rates cannot be ignored. One of the significant consequences is the rapidly aging population. With fewer children being born, the proportion of elderly individuals increases, straining social welfare systems, healthcare, and pension schemes. Additionally, a shrinking workforce due to declining birth rates may lead to labor shortages, skill gaps, and reduced economic productivity. It is evident that declining birth rates have far-reaching implications, impacting not only demographics but also the labor market and global economy. Urgent action and strategic planning are needed to address these challenges and ensure sustainable development in the face of a changing population landscape.', 'By the end of this century, a worrying trend of declining populations may affect nearly every country worldwide. While advancements in healthcare and reduced poverty levels have resulted in increased life spans, the number of births per woman has significantly decreased. In the last five decades, the global fertility rate has dwindled by half to 2.3. In advanced economies, this rate falls below the critical replacement level of 2.1, necessary for population maintenance across generations. Developing nations are also witnessing a parallel decline in fertility rates. Immediate attention and action are imperative to understand and mitigate the implications of this demographic shift.', 'On the other hand, in the United States, the birth rate has been steadily declining since the onset of the Great Recession, plunging by nearly 23% from 2007 to 2022. Presently, the typical American woman gives birth to approximately 1.6 children, a stark drop from the three children per woman in 1950 and well below the crucial ""replacement rate"" of 2.1 children required to maintain a stable population. Immediate attention is essential to grasp the implications of this concerning demographic shift.', 'Let’s now look at some of the companies which are keeping their eyes on the birth rate trend globally, and adjusting their operations accordingly.

PepsiCo’s products are available in more than 200 countries and territories around the world.', '“Immersing ourselves in local food culture is absolutely critical to our food business. It’s one of the biggest priorities,” Mustafa Shamseldin, PepsiCo’s category growth officer and chief marketing officer for international foods, said in an interview. “We want to double down further.”', ""In the company's biggest regions, convenient foods are often responsible for more sales than PepsiCo’s beverages, according to a regulatory filing. In Latin America, these items make up 90% of sales; Africa, Middle East and South Asia, 70%; and Europe, 50%."", 'Brittany Quatrochi, an analyst at Edward Jones, said PepsiCo has done a good job understanding the nuances of consumers in different areas in which they operate — a process that not all companies have been able to successfully master. ', 'With emerging countries tending to grow faster than already established ones, a deeper presence can be lucrative for PepsiCo whose Frito-Lay division gets about 40% of its sales outside North America, she said.', ""PepsiCo’s Frito-Lay has ”done a good job with [localizing a brand] and they'll continue to do more of that over time,” Quatrochi said. “International is definitely a big piece of the growth story.”"", 'PepsiCo’s move to take a brand and give it local flavor is a strategy other snacking companies also have capitalized on.', 'Kellanova, for example, said while sales for its Pringles chip brand are typically anchored around flavors like its original salted and sour cream and onion, its ancillary flavors tend to differ by region and by market.', 'Pringles, which is available in more than 50 countries, has developed a ketchup flavor in Canada and recently co-created Tangy Tomato Twist in India with a local celebrity chef.', 'The snack offering already has more than $3 billion in net sales, but David Lawlor, president of Kellanova Europe, told analysts last week that the brand is still in its “early innings” of growth, particularly as it expands its reach in emerging markets.', 'In some regions such as Latin America and Asia, the increased demand for Pringles is outpacing supply. Kellanova recently started construction on new plans to help meet consumer interest.', '“This ability to adapt to local taste is one of the things that makes the brand so much fun and makes future penetration so attractive and so doable,” Lawlor said.', 'While a product like a chip is popular globally, there are changes companies make to the flavor, texture and even size of the offering that helps it resonate with consumers and give it a more localized appeal.', 'PepsiCo’s Lays, the best-selling snack brand in the world, according to the company, is available in dozens of flavors, including Falafel with pickled lemon in Egypt, cucumber and seaweed options in China, cheese and onion in the U.K. and Sabritas Adobadas (savory spices like red pepper and paprika with a slight tang of tomato and lime) in Mexico.', 'Lays has made similar tweaks to its Magic Masala flavoring in Asia. In India. Magic Masala contains dried mango powder, while in Pakistan the product lists tomato powder. ', 'The cheese flavor for Lays can be lighter in certain regions, favor a white instead of yellow cheese in others, or have a slight tanginess in some places. Shamseldin estimated PepsiCo has created dozens of different cheese flavors for Lays, only a small fraction of which are being used today. ', 'He added that more than any other brand in PepsiCo’s snacking portfolio, flavor is “absolutely critical” for Lays to succeed in a certain location. ', 'PepsiCo’s popular Flamin’ Hot flavor, which is incorporated into several brands such as Doritos, Cheetos, Lays and Ruffles, also can have its spiciness level varied to the point where it could be viewed as really hot in one place and sweet and savory in another.', '“The idea of having a very spicy flavor was so powerful that we took it and wrote that across the world,” Shamseldin recalled.', 'For some brands in PepsiCo’s snacking portfolio, the company turns to other attributes to resonate with local shoppers. In Doritos, PepsiCo can adjust the pressure needed to bite into the chip, while in Cheetos it may alter the size of each corn puff.', 'To help it develop recipes tailored to area food cultures and local flavors, PepsiCo has culinary teams situated in kitchens around the globe. They are responsible for assessing food trends in local regions, including how consumers eat, textures they crave, their emotional connection to food and what is being served at restaurants — all things that could hint at a bigger trend about to break through.', 'PepsiCo also works closely with its insights team to gather trends and observations of food culture across several markets.', '“We are investing in getting closer to the culinary hubs across the world and building capabilities locally to be closer to these markets and to be able to innovate and create content and engage with content at the local level,” Shamseldin said.', 'This story was originally published on Food Dive.
