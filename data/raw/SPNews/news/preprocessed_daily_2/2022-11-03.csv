The revenue decline was primarily due to the sale of the environmental health and safety business (3E), and Verisk Financial Services.Segmental PerformanceThe Insurance segment’s revenues totaled $610.1 million, up 9.4% year over year on a reported basis and 5.3% on an organic cc basis.Within the segment, underwriting and rating revenues of $436.2 million rose 11.7% on a reported basis and 6.5% on an organic cc basis.

1,73fd1ea7-caf1-3777-a0f8-c94a2344f507,SCHW,2022-11-03,"After losing 4.3% in the past year, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) institutional owners must be relieved by the recent gain",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/losing-4-3-past-charles-130023715.html,1667480423,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Every investor in The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 69% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Institutional investors would probably welcome last week's 8.2% increase in share prices after a year of 4.3% losses as a sign that returns are likely to begin trending higher.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Charles Schwab, beginning with the chart below. Check out our latest analysis for Charles Schwab ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Charles Schwab?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Charles Schwab already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Charles Schwab's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInstitutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Charles Schwab is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Toronto-Dominion Bank is the largest shareholder with 12% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 6.2% of common stock, and Charles Schwab holds about 5.9% of the company stock. Charles Schwab, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Co-Chairman of the Board.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 14 have the combined ownership of 51% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too.Insider Ownership Of Charles SchwabThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Shareholders would probably be interested to learn that insiders own shares in The Charles Schwab Corporation. It is a very large company, and board members collectively own US$9.3b worth of shares (at current prices). It is good to see this level of investment. You can check here to see if those insiders have been buying recently. General Public OwnershipWith a 13% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Charles Schwab. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Public Company OwnershipWe can see that public companies hold 12% of the Charles Schwab shares on issue. This may be a strategic interest and the two companies may have related business interests. It could be that they have de-merged. This holding is probably worth investigating further.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. For instance, we've identified   2 warning signs for Charles Schwab  that you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink.

2,306ce922-b739-3543-8a5b-c49410f47fd2,SCHW,2022-11-03,Should Schwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF (FNDX) Be on Your Investing Radar?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/schwab-fundamental-u-large-company-102010002.html,1667470810,STORY,['SCHW'],"[Looking for broad exposure to the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market? You should consider the Schwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF (FNDX), a passively managed exchange traded fund launched on 08/13/2013.The fund is sponsored by Charles Schwab. It has amassed assets over $9.52 billion, making it one of the larger ETFs attempting to match the Large Cap Value segment of the US equity market.Why Large Cap ValueLarge cap companies typically have a market capitalization above $10 billion. Overall, they are usually a stable option, with less risk and more sure-fire cash flows than mid and small cap companies.Value stocks are known for their lower than average price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, but investors should also note their lower than average sales and earnings growth rates. Considering long-term performance, value stocks have outperformed growth stocks in almost all markets; however, they are more likely to underperform growth stocks in strong bull markets.CostsInvestors should also pay attention to an ETF's expense ratio. Lower cost products will produce better results than those with a higher cost, assuming all other metrics remain the same.Annual operating expenses for this ETF are 0.25%, putting it on par with most peer products in the space.It has a 12-month trailing dividend yield of 2.08%.Sector Exposure and Top HoldingsEven though ETFs offer diversified exposure that minimizes single stock risk, investors should also look at the actual holdings inside the fund. Luckily, most ETFs are very transparent products that disclose their holdings on a daily basis.This ETF has heaviest allocation to the Information Technology sector--about 15.50% of the portfolio. Financials and Healthcare round out the top three.Looking at individual holdings, Apple Inc (AAPL) accounts for about 4.39% of total assets, followed by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM) and Microsoft Corp (MSFT).The top 10 holdings account for about 19.55% of total assets under management.Story continuesPerformance and RiskFNDX seeks to match the performance of the Russell RAFI US Large Co. Index before fees and expenses. The Russell RAFI US Large Company Index measures the performance of the large company size segment by fundamental overall company scores.The ETF has lost about -10.13% so far this year and is down about -6.89% in the last one year (as of 11/03/2022). In the past 52-week period, it has traded between $47.76 and $59.90.The ETF has a beta of 1.01 and standard deviation of 25.06% for the trailing three-year period, making it a medium risk choice in the space. With about 729 holdings, it effectively diversifies company-specific risk.AlternativesSchwab Fundamental U.S. Large Company Index ETF holds a Zacks ETF Rank of 2 (Buy), which is based on expected asset class return, expense ratio, and momentum, among other factors. Because of this, FNDX is a great option for investors seeking exposure to the Style Box - Large Cap Value segment of the market. There are other additional ETFs in the space that investors could consider as well.The iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF (IWD) and the Vanguard Value ETF (VTV) track a similar index. While iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF has $52.34 billion in assets, Vanguard Value ETF has $99.57 billion. IWD has an expense ratio of 0.18% and VTV charges 0.04%.Bottom-LineAn increasingly popular option among retail and institutional investors, passively managed ETFs offer low costs, transparency, flexibility, and tax efficiency; they are also excellent vehicles for long term investors.To learn more about this product and other ETFs, screen for products that match your investment objectives and read articles on latest developments in the ETF investing universe, please visit Zacks ETF Center.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

4,f0fc7645-da4c-3454-9489-aab238e35f7f,SCHW,2022-11-03,17 Biggest Finance Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/17-biggest-finance-companies-world-150523288.html,1667401523,STORY,"['GSBD', 'SCHW', 'AXP']","[In this article, we will take a look at 17 of the biggest finance companies by market cap. If you want to see more of the biggest finance companies by market cap, go directly to 5 Biggest Finance Companies in the World.When most people think of finance companies, they think of banks. In terms of banks, there are several types of banks. Traditional community banks take deposits and make loans to individuals. Corporate banks take deposits from generally bigger corporations and make loans to bigger corporations. Lastly, capital market banks help companies and governments issue bonds and stocks in the capital market. In addition to banks, some of the world's biggest financial companies help operate payment networks that help merchants accept payments from their customers.Given their growth, many of today's biggest modern banks offer community banking, corporate banking, capital market services, and other services such as asset management.Economically ImportantFinancial companies operate at the center of modern economies.If the banks do a good job in terms of making quality loans, a country's economy can expand and growth can be faster than it would have otherwise. The banks themselves could potentially make more money in the long run.If banks don't do as good of a job in terms of making quality loans, a country's growth rate might not be as fast as it could have been. The bank's earnings might not be as high as it could be in the long run.Given their importance, many of the world's leading financial institutions are actually considered systematically important and are more regulated as a result.Leading Financial CompaniesGiven the size of the United States economy, many of the world's leading financial companies are based in the United States. With that the U.S. dollar is used as a reserve currency in many nations around the world, many of the leading U.S. financial companies have global operations too.With the growth of the Chinese economy in the past few decades, China's economy is now the second largest economy in the world. As a result, several of the leading Chinese banks rank among the world's largest financial companies. Given the Chinese government plays a much bigger role in the economy than Western governments do, Chinese banks are often run in the interest of the Chinese state rather than in the interest of shareholders at times. As a result, their financial performances may not match that of Western banks even if the economy of China is growing faster.Story continuesGiven its huge population and rapidly growing economy, one Indian bank also ranks among the most valuable financial companies in the world.2022Given the high inflation this year, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates five times already in 2022 and many analysts think the central bank will likely raise rates even further by the end of the year.As a result of the interest rate hikes, many leading financial companies have faced headwinds.Although higher interest rates can benefit traditional community banks by making it easier for them to earn more in net interest income, too rapid of interest rate hikes or too high of interest rates can slow economic activity, which can increase write-offs and lower overall earnings. Given the decline in some bank stocks this year, it seems the market thinks that the write-offs from the potential recession next year might outweigh the positives of higher net interest income, at least in the near term.The higher interest rates have caused markets to decline in value, which hasn't been good for the asset management businesses of some banks. Lastly, the higher interest rates have caused the U.S dollar to strengthen, which isn't good in U.S. dollar terms for some international companies that do business with major financial institutions.Given the uncertainty, it can be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 17 Biggest Finance Companies in the World, we took the 17 largest companies by market capitalization from companiesmarketcap.com's Largest financial service companies by market cap list as of 10/30.17 Biggest Finance Companies in the World17.

The campaign articulates why many investors, as they explore their options, owe it to themselves to understand what makes independent investment advisors stand apart from other financial professionals.The campaign has generated more than 2 billion ad impressions and attracted over 3 million visitors to FindYourIndependentAdvisor.com, Schwab’s independent advisor education center, where investors can learn about the RIA model and how to make an informed choice when choosing an advisor.""We firmly believe independent RIAs play a vital role in providing trusted financial advice that helps investors achieve their life goals, which is why we’ve been champions of the RIA model for more than 30 years,"" said Bernie Clark, head of Schwab Advisor Services. ""As the leading custodian to independent advisors, we’re proud to dedicate our energy and resources to raise awareness of the independent difference.""Directory adds advisors who custody with TD AmeritradeThe website also hosts an advisor directory of more than 2,300 RIA firms, through which visitors can conduct a zip code search to find independent advisors in their community. Since the directory was launched in 2013, investors have conducted more than 300,000 searches, of which 65 percent led to a phone call, website click or email to an advisory firm.Story continuesAnd even before Schwab completes its integration with Ameritrade, the Independent Difference campaign this year profiles some independent investment advisors that use Ameritrade’s custody services and has added some Ameritrade firms to the advisor directory.Schwab’s ad campaign and educational website have helped elevate investor awareness about the many benefits of working with independent RIAs, including customized guidance, competitive fee structures and the opportunity to build deeply personal and trusted relationships. And by walking through key questions investors should ask when seeking an advisor who is right for them, the program has helped shine a positive light on the broader RIA community.""When we first launched this campaign, many investors were unfamiliar with the difference between independent advisors and traditional brokers, so we put our education and advertising muscle to work on behalf of our RIA clients. We are passionate about this work,"" said Susan Forman, head of marketing for Schwab Advisor Services. ""Our ads and educational website showcase how independent advice can make a positive difference for high-net-worth investors.""Investing in ads that celebrate RIAsSchwab began educating investors on the independent difference in 2011 when it introduced the ""RIA Stands for You"" campaign, putting actual advisors front and center while highlighting the values and standards they uphold. The campaign, rebranded ""Independent Difference"" in 2016, has continued to evolve and expand over time. The first national TV ads debuted in 2017, for example, while today Schwab reaches high-net-worth investors through social media channels and interactive digital experiences.""When investors choose an advisor, it’s critical to understand how they’re compensated, the standards they uphold, and whether their financial interests are truly aligned,"" said Thomas Meyer of Meyer Capital Group, a Marlton, New Jersey, advisor who is an advocate for the fiduciary approach. ""A lot of financial professionals these days claim to be client-first, but that may not always be the case, which can create confusion for investors.""To learn more, visit FindYourIndependentAdvisor.com.

8,8e4c92cf-f8e4-39ea-80d9-82adc578bbce,WDC,2022-11-03,Should You Think About Buying Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC) Now?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/think-buying-western-digital-corporation-150819214.html,1667401699,STORY,['WDC'],"[Let's talk about the popular Western Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:WDC). The company's shares saw a double-digit share price rise of over 10% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s examine Western Digital’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. Check out our latest analysis for Western Digital What's The Opportunity In Western Digital?Good news, investors! Western Digital is still a bargain right now. My valuation model shows that the intrinsic value for the stock is $47.80, but it is currently trading at US$35.70 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. Although, there may be another chance to buy again in the future. This is because Western Digital’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market. If the market is bearish, the company's shares will likely fall by more than the rest of the market, providing a prime buying opportunity.What does the future of Western Digital look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 73% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Western Digital. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Since WDC is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. With an optimistic outlook on the horizon, it seems like this growth has not yet been fully factored into the share price. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on WDC for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its prosperous future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy WDC. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.Keep in mind, when it comes to analysing a stock it's worth noting the risks involved.

Carey (WPC) This Earnings Season?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-store-w-p-carey-145002945.html,1667400602,STORY,"['WPC', 'PLD', 'ARE', 'DEI']","[W. P. Carey Inc. WPC is set to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 4 before market open. Both its quarterly revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are likely to have witnessed year-over-year growth.In the last reported quarter, this New York-based net lease REIT delivered a surprise of 1.55% for the adjusted FFO per share.  Over the trailing four quarters, W. P. Carey’s adjusted FFO per share surpassed estimates on three occasions and missed the same on the other, the average surprise being 2.36%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:W.P. Carey Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseW.P. Carey Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseW.P. Carey Inc. price-eps-surprise | W.P. Carey Inc. QuoteThis diversified net lease REIT specializes in sale-leasebacks, build-to-suits and the acquisition of single-tenant net lease properties. WPC focuses on investing in high-quality single-tenant industrial, warehouse, office, retail and self-storage properties, mainly in the United States and Northern and Western Europe.W. P. Carey is poised to benefit from its portfolio of operationally-critical commercial real estate, which it leases back to creditworthy tenants on a long-term basis with built-in rent escalators. Having contractual rent escalators covering nearly the entire portfolio is a saving grace in the current inflationary environment and indicates credit strength.WPC is also focused on capitalizing on accretive investment opportunities. These investments come as part of the company’s external growth strategy and diversified approach.The third quarter has been notable for the company, with W. P. Carey completing the $2.7 billion merger with Corporate Property Associates 18 - Global Incorporated (""CPA:18""). For WPC, the move added a well-diversified and high-quality net lease portfolio, aiding certain portfolio metrics. Per the company, this merger was immediately accretive to the real estate adjusted FFO per share, offsetting the pre-merger income earned from managing CPA:18.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $378.91 million, indicating a 16.32% increase from the prior-year quarter.The consensus estimate for lease revenues for the third quarter is currently pegged at $346.74 million, ahead of the prior-year quarter figure of $314.19 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from real estate ownership is presently pegged at $374.89 million, up from the $320.84 reported in the year-ago quarter. However, the consensus estimate for asset management revenues stands at $1.40 million, lower than the prior-year period’s reported figure of $3.87 million.However, the choppiness in the economy and the rising geopolitical tension and its impact on economic activity might affect the demand for several real estate, and W. P. Carey’s portfolio is not immune to such impacts. Hence, while WPC’s third-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from its high-quality diversified portfolio and strategic investments, choppiness in certain real estate categories is likely to have been a concern.W. P. Carey’s activities during the quarter under review were not adequate to secure analysts’ confidence. The consensus estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has remained unrevised at $1.29 in a month. However, it suggests a 4.03% increase year over year.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for W. P. Carey this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an FFO beat. However, that’s not the case here.W. P. Carey currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Performance of Notable REITsPrologis, Inc. PLD reported a third-quarter 2022 core FFO per share of $1.73, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure jumped a whopping 66.4% from the year-ago quarter’s $1.04. Prologis' results reflected healthy leasing activity with solid rent growth. The bottom line also improved.Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. ARE reported a third-quarter 2022 adjusted FFO per share of $2.13, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The reported figure also compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s $1.95. Alexandria Real Estate Equities' results reflected decent leasing activity and rental rate growth during the quarter.Upcoming ReleaseHere is a stock from the REIT sector — Douglas Emmett, Inc. DEI — that you may want to consider as our model shows that this has the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.Douglas Emmett, scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Nov 3, currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.65% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

Each of these non-GAAP financial measures is either adjusted from GAAP results to exclude certain expenses or derived from multiple GAAP measures, which are outlined in the “Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures” tables, attached, and the “Additional Selected Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Reconciliations” tables, attached.In managing Qorvo's business on a consolidated basis, management develops an annual operating plan, which is approved by our Board of Directors, using non-GAAP financial measures. In developing and monitoring performance against this plan, management considers the actual or potential impacts on these non-GAAP financial measures from actions taken to reduce costs with the goal of increasing gross margin and operating margin. In addition, management relies upon these non-GAAP financial measures to assess whether research and development efforts are at an appropriate level, and when making decisions about product spending, administrative budgets, and other operating expenses. Also, we believe that non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors and enable investors to analyze the results of operations in the same way as management. We have chosen to provide this supplemental information to enable investors to perform additional comparisons of our operating results, to assess our liquidity and capital position and to analyze financial performance excluding the effect of expenses unrelated to operations, certain non-cash expenses and stock-based compensation expense, which may obscure trends in Qorvo's underlying performance.We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures offer an additional view of Qorvo's operations that, when coupled with the GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide a more complete understanding of Qorvo's results of operations and the factors and trends affecting Qorvo's business. However, these non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as a supplement to, and not as a substitute for, or superior to, the corresponding measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.Our rationale for using these non-GAAP financial measures, as well as their impact on the presentation of Qorvo's operations, are outlined below:Non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin.  Non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin exclude amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and certain non-cash expenses. We believe that exclusion of these costs in presenting non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical performance and projected costs and the potential for realizing cost efficiencies.We view amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets, such as the amortization of the cost associated with an acquired company’s research and development efforts, trade names, and customer relationships, as items arising from pre-acquisition activities, determined at the time of an acquisition, rather than ongoing costs of operating Qorvo’s business. While these intangible assets are continually evaluated for impairment, amortization of the cost of purchased intangible assets is a static expense, which is not typically affected by operations during any particular period. Although we exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets from these non-GAAP financial measures, management believes that it is important for investors to understand that such intangible assets were recorded as part of purchase price accounting and contribute to revenue generation.We believe that presentation of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and other non-GAAP financial measures that exclude the impact of stock-based compensation expense assists management and investors in evaluating the period-over-period performance of Qorvo's ongoing operations because (i) the expenses are non-cash in nature, and (ii) although the size of the grants is within our control, the amount of expense varies depending on factors such as short-term fluctuations in stock price volatility and prevailing interest rates, which can be unrelated to the operational performance of Qorvo during the period in which the expense is incurred and generally are outside the control of management. Moreover, we believe that the exclusion of stock-based compensation expense in presenting non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and other non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors to understand the impact of the expensing of stock-based compensation to Qorvo's gross profit and gross margins and other financial measures in comparison to prior periods. We also believe that the adjustments to profit and margin related to certain non-cash expenses do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore the exclusion of these items provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual revenue and actual costs required to generate revenues over time and facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin has economic substance because the excluded expenses do not represent continuing cash expenditures and, as described above, we have little control over the timing and amount of the expenses in question.For the three months ended July 2, 2022, non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin also exclude charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement. Unprecedented disruption resulting from measures taken in China to control the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine have negatively impacted demand for 5G handsets in China and EMEA within a short period of time. As a result of these extraordinary circumstances, we did not meet the minimum purchase commitments under a long-term capacity reservation agreement with a foundry supplier. This resulted in shortfall charges that have been recorded in our cost of goods sold. We believe these charges are not reflective of the performance of our ongoing business as they were the result of unprecedented disruption resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict in Ukraine.Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin. Non-GAAP operating income and operating margin exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration related costs, gain or loss on assets, asset impairments, start-up costs, restructuring related charges, charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement and certain non-cash expenses. We believe that presentation of a measure of operating income and operating margin that excludes amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense is useful to both management and investors for the same reasons as described above with respect to our use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin. We believe that acquisition and integration related costs, gain or loss on assets, asset impairments, start-up costs, restructuring related charges, charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement and certain non-cash expenses do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore, the exclusion of these costs provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual costs required to generate revenues over time and facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP operating income and operating margin has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures.Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share. Non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share exclude the effects of stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets, acquisition and integration related costs, gain or loss on assets, asset impairments, start-up costs, restructuring related charges, charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement, certain non-cash expenses, gain or loss on investments, other expense (income) and also reflect an adjustment of income taxes. The income tax adjustment primarily represents the use of research and development tax credit carryforwards, deferred tax expense (benefit) items not affecting taxes payable, adjustments related to the deemed and actual repatriation of historical foreign earnings, non-cash expense (benefit) related to uncertain tax positions and other items unrelated to the current fiscal year or that are not indicative of our ongoing business operations. We believe that presentation of measures of net income and net income per diluted share that exclude these items is useful to both management and investors for the reasons described above with respect to non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin and non-GAAP operating income and operating margin. We believe disclosure of non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP net income per diluted share has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures.Non-GAAP operating expenses (research and development and selling, general and administrative). Non-GAAP research and development and selling, general and administrative expenses exclude stock-based compensation expense, amortization of intangible assets and certain non-cash expenses (primarily acquisition and integration related costs). We believe that presentation of measures of these operating expenses that exclude amortization of intangible assets and stock-based compensation expense is useful to both management and investors for the same reasons as described above with respect to our use of non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin. We believe that acquisition and integration related costs and certain non-cash expenses do not constitute part of Qorvo's ongoing operations and therefore, the exclusion of these costs provides management and investors with better visibility into the actual costs required to generate revenues over time and facilitates a useful evaluation of our historical and projected performance. We believe disclosure of these non-GAAP operating expenses has economic substance because the excluded expenses are either unrelated to ongoing operations or do not represent current cash expenditures.Free cash flow. Qorvo defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities during the period minus property and equipment expenditures made during the period, and free cash flow margin is calculated as free cash flow as a percentage of revenue. We use free cash flow as a supplemental financial measure in our evaluation of liquidity and financial strength. Management believes that this measure is useful as an indicator of our ability to service our debt, meet other payment obligations and make strategic investments. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income as a measure of our performance and net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Additionally, our definition of free cash flow is limited, in that it does not represent residual cash flows available for discretionary expenditures due to the fact that the measure does not deduct the payments required for debt service and other contractual obligations. Therefore, we believe it is important to view free cash flow as a measure that provides supplemental information to our entire statement of cash flows.EBITDA. Qorvo adjusts GAAP net income for interest expense, interest income, income tax expense (benefit), depreciation and intangible amortization expense, stock-based compensation and other charges that are not representative of Qorvo's ongoing operations (including asset impairments, investment activity, acquisition-related costs, certain charges associated with a long-term capacity reservation agreement and restructuring-related costs) when presenting EBITDA. Management believes that this measure is useful to evaluate our ongoing operations and as a general indicator of our operating cash flow (in conjunction with a cash flow statement which also includes among other items, changes in working capital and the effect of non-cash charges).Non-GAAP ROIC. Return on invested capital (ROIC) is a non-GAAP financial measure that management believes provides useful supplemental information for management and the investor by measuring the effectiveness of our operations' use of invested capital to generate profits. We use ROIC to track how much value we are creating for our shareholders. Non-GAAP ROIC is calculated by dividing annualized non-GAAP operating income, net of an adjustment for income taxes (as described above), by average invested capital. Average invested capital is calculated by subtracting the average of the beginning balance and the ending balance of equity plus net debt, less certain goodwill.Net debt or positive net cash. Net debt or positive net cash is defined as unrestricted cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments minus any borrowings under our credit facility and the principal balance of our senior unsecured notes. Management believes that net debt or positive net cash provides useful information regarding the level of Qorvo's indebtedness by reflecting cash and investments that could be used to repay debt.Inventory days on hand. Inventory days on hand is defined as (a) average net inventory for the period, divided by (b) the result of non-GAAP cost of goods sold for the period divided by the number of days in the period.Forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures.  Our earnings release contains forward-looking free cash flow, gross margin, income tax rate and diluted earnings per share. We provide these non-GAAP measures to investors on a prospective basis for the same reasons (set forth above) that we provide them to investors on a historical basis. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of the forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable forward-looking GAAP financial measures without unreasonable effort due to variability and difficulty in making accurate projections for items that would be required to be included in the GAAP measures, such as stock-based compensation, acquisition and integration related costs, restructuring related charges, gain or loss on assets, asset impairments, gain or loss on investments and the provision for income taxes. We believe such reconciliations would imply a degree of precision that would be confusing or misleading to investors.Limitations of non-GAAP financial measures. The primary material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool compared to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures are these non-GAAP financial measures (i) may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies in our industry, and (ii) exclude financial information that some may consider important in evaluating our performance, thus limiting their usefulness as a comparative tool. We compensate for these limitations by providing full disclosure of the differences between these non-GAAP financial measures and the corresponding GAAP financial measures, including a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the corresponding GAAP financial measures, to enable investors to perform their own analysis of our gross profit and gross margin, operating expenses, operating income, net income, net income per diluted share and net cash provided by operating activities. We further compensate for the limitations of our use of non-GAAP financial measures by presenting the corresponding GAAP measures more prominently.Qorvo will conduct a conference call at 5:00 p.m. ET today to discuss today’s press release.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Dividend Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks By Hedge Funds. High bond yields have been a positive addition to the portfolios of income investors after years of nominal fixed-income returns. However, dividend stocks still provide essential balance and additional income to an asset portfolio, and they help combat the high inflation effectively. Jenny Harrington, CEO of Gilman Hill Asset Management, told Barron’s on October 29:“You need capital appreciation of the share price and growth of the dividend in an inflationary environment.”Dividend stocks have comparatively outperformed in the market selloff this year. Dividend-paying entities in the S&amp;P 500 have dropped 11%, compared to the 19% decline in the S&amp;P 500 benchmark and the 23% drop in non-dividend stocks so far this year. Income stocks are attractive amid market volatility since they protect investors against plummeting share prices. Stephanie Link, the chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors, advised investors to focus on dividend growth prospects rather than high yields alone. She further said:“If companies are going to continue to increase their dividends, then I feel good about them.”Similarly, David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Advisors, noted that although Treasury yield has risen which means that bond payout is attractive at about 4%, dividend stocks provide the potential for increasing payouts while bond payments remain fixed. Some of the best entities for a dividend stock portfolio include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology We selected the following dividend stocks based on their popularity among elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022. We have also mentioned the latest analyst coverage, underlying business fundamentals, and recent dividend payouts by the companies for additional context for readers. The dividend yields are mentioned as of November 2. Story continuesDividend Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks By Hedge FundsPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashDividend Stock Portfolio: Top Stock Picks By Hedge Funds10. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Dividend Yield as of November 2: 1.08%S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is a New York-based provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, data analytics, and workflow solutions in the global capital and commodity markets. The company operates through six divisions – S&amp;P Global Ratings, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, S&amp;P Global Mobility, and S&amp;P Global Engineering Solutions. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) declared on September 28 a $0.85 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 12, to shareholders of record on November 18. As of October 27, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) has completed $11 billion of its $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program year-to-date, and it expects to launch the remaining $1 billion of the authorized repurchase units in December.Argus analyst John Eade on November 1 maintained a Buy recommendation on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) but lowered the price target on the shares to $365 from $420. The company has almost concluded a multi-year restructuring and is now focused on its rapidly growing financial businesses, including the lucrative and not very competitive business of rating bonds, the analyst told investors in a research note. The analyst also added that he believes S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) management can pull through the tough inflation and high interest rate environment.According to Insider Monkey’s database, 84 hedge funds were bullish on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) at the end of June 2022, compared to 97 funds in the prior quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 8.76 million shares worth nearly $3 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is one of the top picks of elite investors for a dividend stock portfolio. Here is what Baron Durable Advantage Fund has to say about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”9. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Dividend Yield as of November 2: 0.12%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the American multinational technology and semiconductor firm, is one of the most popular picks of hedge funds for a dividend stock portfolio. At the end of October, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock gained as investors turned their attention towards the semiconductor industry in the midst of the Intel and Mobileye spin-off. On October 24, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis maintained an Overweight rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but lowered the price target on the shares to $140 from $190. The analyst is ""actively looking for a bottom to get more positive"" on the semiconductor sector and sees it closer in some end markets than others, but still believes ""it is too early to pull the trigger across the board."" According to Insider Monkey’s data, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was part of 84 hedge fund portfolios at the end of June 2022, compared to 102 in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 7.6 million shares worth $1.15 billion.  Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below.During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”8.

(NYSE:TMO) is a Massachusetts-based provider of life sciences solutions, analytical instruments, specialty diagnostics, and laboratory products and services worldwide. As per elite hedge funds, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is one of the premier picks for a dividend stock portfolio. On October 31, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.

Shares fell due to the rotation out of life sciences tools stocks, driven by concerns about a possible global recession, foreign currency exposure, COVID-related lockdowns in China, and reduced levels of biotechnology funding. We continue to believe Thermo Fisher has a strong long-term growth outlook given a large and growing addressable market coupled with its industry-leading scale, commercial infrastructure, e-commerce platform, supply-chain capabilities, and R&amp;D investment.”6. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Dividend Yield as of November 2: 2.42%Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is an American multinational company that provides banking and financial products and services. The bank operates through Consumer Banking, Global Wealth &amp; Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets segments. On October 17, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) reported earnings for the third quarter of 2022, announcing earnings per share of $0.81 and a revenue of $24.50 billion, topping market estimates by $0.04 and $1.05 billion, respectively. On October 19, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 30, to shareholders of record on December 2. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) delivers a dividend yield of 2.42% as of November 2. BMO Capital analyst James Fotheringham raised the price target on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) on October 18 to $42 from $41 but kept a Market Perform rating on the shares. The analyst cited Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)’s ""impressive"" Q3 top-line beat and ""meaningful"" operating leverage as its pre-provision net revenue grew 24% compared to Q2 2022. However, the analyst added that it remains too early to purchase bank stocks, and he believes that Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stock will struggle until the economic backdrop stabilizes.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 99 funds were bullish on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) at the end of Q2 2022, with collective stakes worth $36 billion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with more than 1 billion shares worth $31.4 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is one of the premier stocks to consider for a robust dividend stock portfolio. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We made only one new purchase during the quarter, initiating a position in Bank of America (BAC). As one of America’s largest banks, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is second only to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in size and is probably its closest peer. Both are well-run banks, but compared to JPM, since the GFC, BAC has retired more shares, grown EPS faster and currently has more capital and a lower dividend payout. We are attracted to BAC’s strong capital base, high capital generation capacity, large loan loss reserve, low (~50%) loan/deposit ratio, short duration investment securities book, and low dividend payout that provides financial flexibility. BAC has a less volatile earnings stream than JPM with lower capital market sensitive exposures. Additionally, BAC is rigorously stress tested by the Fed every year in quantitative and qualitative fashion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which we hold in the portfolio, owns 12% of BAC. He petitioned the Fed to own more than 10%, so he clearly likes it. Bank stocks were strong gainers in 2021 on the prospects of higher rates boosting net interest margins, but the stocks pulled back in the first half of 2022 on economic concerns. We believe BAC has massive scale advantages, should benefit from increasing interest rates, particularly in the 2-year part of the yield curve, and should grow over time with the economy. The economic environment is highly uncertain, but current consensus includes the provision for losses more than doubling and capital markets activity slowing. Against that backdrop, our purchase price equated to about 8.5X our estimates of “mid-cycle” earnings. With leading businesses, a double-digit ROE, a prudent capital return strategy and a strong balance sheet, we believe this entry point offers a solid long-term value.” Click to continue reading and see Dividend Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks By Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Infrastructure Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Bank Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

""The conditions that have supported nitrogen prices for the last year - reduced global supply availability from lower operating rates due to high energy costs for marginal production in Europe and Asia - show no signs of abating. As a result, we expect the global nitrogen supply-demand balance to remain tight with attractive margin opportunities for low-cost producers further into the future.""Story continuesNitrogen Market OutlookManagement expects the global nitrogen supply-demand balance will remain tight into 2025 due to agriculture-led demand and forward energy curves that point to persistently high energy prices in Europe and Asia.The need to replenish global grains stocks, which has supported high prices for corn, wheat and canola, continues to drive global nitrogen demand. Below-trend yields are expected in key growing regions, including the U.S., due to unfavorable weather during 2022, preventing any meaningful increase to global grains stocks this year. Management believes that it will take at least two more seasons at trend yield to fully replenish global grains stocks, supporting strong grains plantings and incentivizing nitrogen fertilizer application over this time period.North America: High crop futures prices, along with healthy farm economics, are projected to support high corn and wheat planted acreage in 2023.India: Management expects that India will tender for urea throughout the remainder of the year and into 2023 to fully meet increased demand as farmers maximize grain production.Europe: Ammonia and upgraded fertilizer production curtailments in Europe have led to significantly higher nitrogen imports to the region in the second half of 2022. Imports of urea into Europe are well-above their typical pace in part to replace lower nitrate supply.Global nitrogen supply availability remains constrained as high energy prices in Europe and Asia have led to substantial curtailments of ammonia production in these regions. During the third quarter of 2022, an estimated 60% of ammonia capacity in Europe did not operate. For facilities able to do so, production economics continue to favor importing ammonia to manufacture upgraded products.China: Urea exports from China remain lower than prior years due to measures the Chinese government has implemented to promote availability and affordability of fertilizers domestically. Management continues to expect that full year urea exports from China will be in the range of 1.5-2 million metric tons, well below the three-year average.Russia: Exports of ammonia from Russia are significantly lower in 2022 compared to prior years due to geopolitical disruptions arising from Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and related logistics bottlenecks. In contrast, exports of other nitrogen products from the country are at near-normal levels.Forward energy curves suggest that production economics in Europe and Asia are likely to remain challenged for at least the next two years. Additionally, the forward curves point to an extended period of wide energy differentials between Europe and Asia and low-cost regions. As a result, the Company believes the global nitrogen cost curve will be steeper for longer, supporting increased margin opportunities for low-cost North American producers.Operations OverviewThe Company continues to operate safely and efficiently across its network. As of September 30, 2022, the 12-month rolling average recordable incident rate was 0.29 incidents per 200,000 work hours, significantly better than industry benchmarks.Gross ammonia production for the first nine months and third quarter of 2022 was approximately 7.4 million tons and 2.3 million tons, respectively. The Company expects that gross ammonia production for 2022 will be in the range of 9.5 to 10.0 million tons.Financial Results OverviewFirst Nine Months 2022 Financial ResultsFor the first nine months of 2022, net earnings attributable to common stockholders were $2.49 billion, or $12.04 per diluted share, and EBITDA was $4.30 billion, which include the impact of pre-tax impairment and restructuring charges of $257 million related to the Company’s UK operations; adjusted EBITDA was $4.58 billion. These results compare to the first nine months of 2021 net earnings attributable to common stockholders of $212 million, or $0.98 per diluted share and EBITDA of $984 million, which included the impact of pre-tax impairment charges of $495 million related to the Company’s UK operations; and adjusted EBITDA of $1.49 billion.Net sales in the first nine months of 2022 were $8.58 billion compared to $4.00 billion in the first nine months of 2021. Average selling prices for the first nine months of 2022 were higher than the first nine months of 2021 across all segments due to decreased global supply availability, as higher global energy costs reduced global operating rates and geopolitical factors disrupted the global fertilizer supply chain. Sales volumes in the first nine months of 2022 were higher than the first nine months of 2021 due to greater supply availability from higher production in 2022 compared to 2021.Cost of sales for the first nine months of 2022 was higher compared to the first nine months of 2021 due primarily to higher natural gas costs.In the first nine months of 2022, the average cost of natural gas reflected in the Company’s cost of sales was $7.28 per MMBtu compared to the average cost of natural gas in cost of sales of $3.51 per MMBtu in the first nine months of 2021.Third Quarter 2022 Financial Results OverviewFor the third quarter of 2022, net earnings attributable to common stockholders were $438 million, or $2.18 per diluted share, and EBITDA was $826 million, which include the impact of pre-tax impairment and restructuring charges of $95 million related to the Company’s UK operations; and adjusted EBITDA was $983 million.

Average selling prices for 2022 were higher than 2021 across all segments due to decreased global supply availability, as higher global energy costs reduced global operating rates and geopolitical factors disrupted the global fertilizer supply chain. Sales volumes in the third quarter of 2022 were higher than 2021 due to greater supply availability from higher production as well as higher starting inventories in the third quarter of 2022 compared to 2021.Cost of sales for the third quarter of 2022 was higher compared to 2021 primarily due to higher natural gas costs.In the third quarter of 2022, the average cost of natural gas reflected in the Company’s cost of sales was $8.35 per MMBtu compared to the average cost of natural gas in cost of sales of $4.21 per MMBtu in 2021.Capital ManagementCapital ExpendituresCapital expenditures in the third quarter and first nine months of 2022 were $190 million and $319 million, respectively, which incorporates expenditures related to the Company’s clean energy initiatives, including the purchase of property on the west bank of Ascension Parish, Louisiana, to facilitate potential growth of blue ammonia production capacity.

The estimate of the partnership distribution earned by CHS, but not yet declared, for the third quarter of 2022 is $106 million.Clean Energy InitiativesCF Industries continues to advance its plans to support the global hydrogen and clean fuel economy, which is expected to grow significantly over the next decade, through the production of blue ammonia (ammonia produced with the corresponding CO2 byproduct removed through carbon capture and sequestration) and green ammonia (ammonia produced from carbon-free sources).Joint Venture with Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd.CF Industries and Mitsui &amp; Co., Ltd. have initiated a front-end engineering and design (FEED) study for their proposed joint venture to construct an export-oriented greenfield blue ammonia facility in Ascension Parish, Louisiana. The companies had previously signed a joint development agreement that provides the framework for the FEED study.CF Industries and Mitsui have signed an agreement with thyssenkrupp UHDE to conduct the FEED study. Additionally, CF Industries acquired land during the third quarter of 2022 on the west bank of Ascension Parish, Louisiana, on which the proposed facility would be constructed should the companies agree to move forward. CF Industries and Mitsui expect to make a final investment decision on the proposed facility in the second half of 2023. Construction and commissioning of a new world-scale capacity ammonia plant typically takes approximately 4 years from that point.Carbon Capture and Sequestration Agreement to Enable Blue Ammonia Production at Donaldsonville ComplexCF Industries has entered into the largest-of-its-kind commercial agreement with ExxonMobil to capture and permanently store up to 2 million tons of CO2 emissions annually from its Donaldsonville Complex in Louisiana. As previously announced, CF Industries is investing $200 million to build a CO2 dehydration and compression unit at the facility to enable captured CO2 to be transported and stored. Under the agreement, ExxonMobil will then transport and permanently store the captured CO2 in secure geologic storage it owns in Vermilion Parish, Louisiana. As part of the project, ExxonMobil has signed an agreement with EnLink Midstream to use EnLink’s transportation network to deliver CO2 to permanent geologic storage. Start-up for the project is scheduled for early 2025.Donaldsonville Green Ammonia ProjectThe Donaldsonville green ammonia project, which involves installing an electrolysis system at Donaldsonville to generate carbon-free hydrogen from water that will then be supplied to an existing ammonia plant to produce green ammonia, continues to progress. Major equipment is being fabricated and site work has begun for installation of the new electrolyzer unit and integration into Donaldsonville’s existing operations. Once complete, the project will enable the Company to produce approximately 20,000 tons of green ammonia per year.___________________________________________________(1)Certain items recognized during the first nine months and third quarter of 2022 impacted our financial results and their comparability to the prior year period.

A reconciliation of adjusted gross margin, adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales and adjusted gross margin per product ton and per nutrient ton to gross margin, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, is provided in the table above. See ""Note Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" in this release.Comparison of 2022 to 2021 first nine months periods:Ammonia sales volume for the first nine months of 2022 was similar to the first nine months of 2021.Ammonia average selling prices increased for the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021 due to decreased global supply availability, as higher global energy costs reduced global operating rates and geopolitical factors disrupted the global fertilizer supply chain.Ammonia adjusted gross margin per ton increased for the first nine months of 2022 compared to 2021 due to higher average selling prices, partially offset by higher realized natural gas costs.Granular Urea SegmentCF Industries’ granular urea segment produces granular urea, which contains 46 percent nitrogen. Produced from ammonia and carbon dioxide, it has the highest nitrogen content of any of the Company’s solid nitrogen products.Three months endedSeptember 30,Nine months endedSeptember 30,2022202120222021(dollars in millions,except per ton amounts)Net sales$689$386$2,287$1,218Cost of sales3942001,024705Gross margin$295$186$1,263$513Gross margin percentage42.8%48.2%55.2%42.1%Sales volume by product tons (000s)1,2628603,5393,272Sales volume by nutrient tons (000s)(1)5803961,6281,505Average selling price per product ton$546$449$646$372Average selling price per nutrient ton(1)1,1889751,405809Adjusted gross margin(2):Gross margin$295$186$1,263$513Depreciation and amortization7958213179Unrealized net mark-to-market loss (gain) on natural gas derivatives4(3)(4)(5)Adjusted gross margin$378$241$1,472$687Adjusted gross margin as a percent of net sales54.9%62.4%64.4%56.4%Gross margin per product ton$234$216$357$157Gross margin per nutrient ton(1)509470776341Adjusted gross margin per product ton300280]"

The report outlines that machine learning, cloud computing, and 3G and 4G connectivity will drive this growth - as sellers use the advanced technologies to optimize their customer offerings and the connectivity platforms enable more people to connect to the Internet.Another report, this time from Spherical Insights, places an even more optimistic CAGR of 14.3% on the e-commerce sector. It wagers that the industry was worth $810 billion last year and will grow through the aforementioned CAGR to sit at a whopping $1.9 trillion by the end of 2030.

In addition, we have been impressed with the operational progress this management team has made since taking the helm in 2017.

Here is what the fund said:In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”Along with Amazon.com, Inc.

Neither company admitted wrongdoing. Walmart has agreed to pay $3.1 billion, mostly up front, according to two people familiar with the matter.Paul Geller, one of the lawyers who negotiated for the governments, said that settlements with pharmacies ""will bring billions of additional dollars to communities that are desperate for funds to combat the epidemic"" of opioid addiction.""We know that reckless, profit-driven dispensing practices fueled the crisis; but we know just as surely that with better systems in place and proper heeding of red flag warnings, pharmacies can play a direct role in reducing opioid abuse and in saving lives,"" Geller said.CVS general counsel Thomas Moriarty said in a statement the company was pleased to resolve the claims and the deal was ""in the best interest of all parties, as well as our customers, colleagues and shareholders.""Walgreens in a statement said: ""As one of the largest pharmacy chains in the nation, we remain committed to being a part of the solution, and this settlement framework will allow us to keep our focus on the health and wellbeing of our customers and patients, while making positive contributions to address the opioid crisis.""Both CVS and Walgreens said their agreements would not be final until certain non-monetary terms were worked out, and that the total amount could be reduced if not enough government plaintiffs sign on.Story continuesWalmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The proposed settlement, which would be the first nationwide deal with retail pharmacy companies, follows nationwide opioid settlements with drugmakers and distributors totaling more than $33 billion.HUMAN AND ECONOMIC TOLLIn more than 3,300 lawsuits, beginning in 2017, state, local and Native American tribal governments accused drugmakers of downplaying the risks of their opioid pain medicines, and distributors and pharmacies of ignoring red flags that prescriptions were being diverted into illegal trafficking.They said the resulting human toll, as well as strain on public health services and law enforcement, was a public nuisance that the companies must pay to fix.CVS, Walgreens and Walmart are the three largest retail pharmacies in the country by market share. If their settlement becomes final, it will put much of the sprawling, years-long litigation over opioids to rest, though cases are still pending against smaller, more regionally focused pharmacy operators including Rite Aid Corp and Kroger Co.Plaintiffs had scored some significant trial victories against pharmacy chains, including a $650.6 million judgment in favor of two Ohio counties against CVS, Walgreens and Walmart, and a ruling that Walgreens contributed to San Francisco's opioid epidemic.San Francisco is not included in the national settlement, and is scheduled to begin a second trial against Walgreens next week to determine how much the company must pay.State and local authorities have said they will use the money from the settlements to combat the opioid crisis, which according to federal government data has caused nearly 650,000 overdose deaths since 1999 and is continuing to worsen.Prescriptions for opioids rose sharply in the 1990s as companies aggressively promoted the drugs, long used primarily in cancer patients, as a safe way to treat all kinds of chronic pain.Overdoses involving opioids, including prescription pills and heroin, surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing 38% in 2020 over the previous year and another 15% in 2021, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.The agency has attributed much of the recent rise in overdose cases to illegally manufactured fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid.A congressional report last month put the economic toll of the opioid crisis in 2020 alone at $1.5 trillion.(Reporting by Baranjot Kaur in Bengaluru, Brendan Pierson in New York and Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi, Mark Potter and Bill Berkrot)]"

Currency-neutral revenue is expected to be up at a mid-single-digit percentage rate compared to the previous expectation of 7 to 9 percent growth.Gross margin remains unchanged from the previous outlook of a 375 to 425 basis point decline.Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses are expected to be down slightly against the prior year as the company manages costs amid uncertain market conditions.Operating income is expected to reach $270 to $290 million compared to the previous range of $300 to $325 million. Excluding an expense related to ongoing litigation matters, adjusted operating income is expected to reach $290 to $310 million compared to the previous range of $310 to $335 million.Diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.56 to $0.60 compared to the previous expectation of $0.61 to $0.67.

Currency-neutral financial information is calculated to exclude changes in foreign currency exchange rates. References to adjusted financial measures exclude the effect of legal expenses related to ongoing litigation matters, the company's 2020 restructuring plan, and related impairment charges, including goodwill and related tax effects. Where applicable, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted income (loss) per share exclude the non-cash amortization of debt discount on the company's convertible senior notes, any gain or loss on extinguishing the company's convertible senior notes, and related tax effects, and any gain or loss from divestitures (including associated earn-outs and expenses) and related tax effects. Management believes these adjustments are not core to the company's operations. The reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated according to GAAP is presented in supplemental financial information furnished with this release. All per-share amounts are reported on a diluted basis. In addition, in connection with its change in fiscal year-end from December 31 to March 31, Under Armour is presenting select non-GAAP financial measures for the twelve months beginning on April 1, 2021, and ending March 31, 2022, to provide comparable reference periods against the company's new fiscal 2023 year, which began April 1, 2022, and ends on March 31, 2023.

They should be contemplated in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the company's reported results prepared per GAAP.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $1,555 million, indicating a marginal increase of about 0.6% from the prior-year period’s reported figure.The bottom line of this developer, marketer and distributor of apparel, footwear and accessories is expected to decrease from the prior-year quarter’s reading. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents for earnings per share in the second quarter has been stable over the past 30 days. The figure suggests a sharp decline from the earnings of 31 cents reported in the year-ago period.This Baltimore, MD-based player has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 28.8%, on average.Key Things to NoteThe second quarter of fiscal 2023 might have been another soft one for Under Armour, at least consensus numbers say so. A competitive landscape, supply-chain issues and higher shipping costs might have hurt the company’s performance. Also, a highly promotional environment and adverse foreign currency might have been added deterrents.On its last earnings call, Under Armour guided second-quarter revenues to be flat to up marginally on a reported basis and rise at a low-to-mid-single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis. This includes about five percentage points of headwinds from proactive reductions and cancellations to order books due to pandemic-related supply constraints.Management projected a gross margin contraction of approximately 550 to 600 basis points for the second quarter due to an adverse impact of elevated promotional activities, higher freight expenses, shifts and a channel mix and increasing pressures from changes in foreign currency.The company guided the second-quarter operating income between $105 million and $115 million, down from the adjusted operating income of $188.8 million in the year-ago period. It envisions earnings in the band of 15 cents-17 cents a share, down from the adjusted earnings of 31 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.On the flip side, Under Armour’s robust operating model, strength in the direct-to-consumer business and investments in products and marketing might have cushioned its quarterly performance. The company’s strategy to focus on improving sales through product innovation, investments in its stores and acceleration of e-commerce capabilities and selling more inventory at a full price bodes well.Story continuesUnder Armour, Inc.

Buying under-rated businesses is one path to excess returns. For example, the Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, Inc. (NYSE:MMC) share price is up 93% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 38% (ignoring dividends).With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. See our latest analysis for Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Over half a decade, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies managed to grow its earnings per share at 13% a year. This EPS growth is reasonably close to the 14% average annual increase in the share price. That suggests that the market sentiment around the company hasn't changed much over that time. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Even so, future earnings will be far more important to whether current shareholders make money. This free interactive report on Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies, it has a TSR of 110% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile it's never nice to take a loss, Marsh &amp; McLennan Companies shareholders can take comfort that , including dividends,their trailing twelve month loss of 0.8% wasn't as bad as the market loss of around 25%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 16%, each year, over five years. In the best case scenario the last year is just a temporary blip on the journey to a brighter future. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

MetLife believes that these non-GAAP financial measures enhance the understanding for MetLife and its investors of MetLife's performance by highlighting the results of operations and the underlying profitability drivers of the business. Segment-specific financial measures are calculated using only the portion of consolidated results attributable to that specific segment.The following non-GAAP financial measures should not be viewed as substitutes for the most directly comparable financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP:Non-GAAP financial measures:Comparable GAAP financial measures:(i)total adjusted revenues;(i)total revenues;(ii)total adjusted expenses;(ii)total expenses;(iii)adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues;(iii)premiums, fees and other revenues;(iv)adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding PRT;(iv)premiums, fees and other revenues;(v)adjusted net investment income;(v)net investment income;(vi)adjusted capitalization of deferred policy acquisition costs (DAC);(vi)capitalization of DAC;(vii)adjusted earnings available to common shareholders;(vii)net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders;(viii)adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items;(viii)net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders;(ix)adjusted earnings available to common shareholders per diluted common share;(ix)net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders per diluted common share;(x)adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items, per diluted common share;(x)net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders per diluted common share;(xi)adjusted return on equity;(xi)return on equity;(xii)adjusted return on equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA;(xii)return on equity;(xiii)adjusted return on equity, excluding total notable items (excludes AOCI other than FCTA);(xiii)return on equity;(xiv)adjusted tangible return on equity;(xiv)return on equity;(xv)investment portfolio gains (losses);(xv)net investment gains (losses);(xvi)derivative gains (losses);(xvi)net derivative gains (losses);(xvii)total MetLife, Inc.’s tangible common stockholders’ equity;(xvii)total MetLife, Inc.’s stockholders’ equity;(xviii)total MetLife, Inc.’s tangible common stockholders’ equity, excluding total notable items;(xviii)total MetLife, Inc.’s stockholders’ equity;(xix)total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA;(xix)total MetLife, Inc.’s stockholders’ equity;(xx)total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding total notable items (excludes AOCI other than FCTA);(xx)total MetLife, Inc.’s stockholders’ equity;(xxi)book value per common share, excluding AOCI other than FCTA;(xxi)book value per common share;(xxii)book value per common share - tangible common stockholders' equity;(xxii)book value per common share;(xxiii)free cash flow of all holding companies;(xxiii)MetLife, Inc.

Consistent with GAAP guidance for segment reporting, adjusted earnings and components of, or other financial measures based on, adjusted earnings are also MetLife’s GAAP measures of segment performance. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings are also the measures by which MetLife senior management’s and many other employees’ performance is evaluated for the purposes of determining their compensation under applicable compensation plans. Adjusted earnings and other financial measures based on adjusted earnings allow analysis of MetLife's performance relative to its business plan and facilitate comparisons to industry results.Adjusted earnings is defined as adjusted revenues less adjusted expenses, net of income tax. Adjusted loss is defined as negative adjusted earnings. Adjusted earnings available to common shareholders is defined as adjusted earnings less preferred stock dividends.Adjusted revenues and adjusted expensesThese financial measures, along with the related adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, focus on our primary businesses principally by excluding the impact of market volatility, which could distort trends, and revenues and costs related to non-core products and certain entities required to be consolidated under GAAP. Also, these measures exclude results of discontinued operations under GAAP and other businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife but do not meet the discontinued operations criteria under GAAP and are referred to as divested businesses. Divested businesses also include the net impact of transactions with exited businesses that have been eliminated in consolidation under GAAP and costs relating to businesses that have been or will be sold or exited by MetLife that do not meet the criteria to be included in results of discontinued operations under GAAP.Adjusted revenues also excludes net investment gains (losses) (NIGL) and net derivative gains (losses) (NDGL). Adjusted expenses also excludes goodwill impairments.The following additional adjustments are made to revenues, in the line items indicated, in calculating adjusted revenues:Universal life and investment-type product policy fees excludes the amortization of unearned revenue related to NIGL and NDGL (Unearned revenue adjustments) and certain variable annuity guaranteed minimum income benefits (GMIB) fees (GMIB fees);Net investment income: (i) includes adjustments for earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of investments or that are used to replicate certain investments, but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment (Investment hedge adjustments), (ii) excludes post-tax adjusted earnings adjustments relating to insurance joint ventures accounted for under the equity method (Operating joint venture adjustments), (iii) excludes certain amounts related to contractholder-directed equity securities (Unit-linked contract income), (iv) excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are variable interest entities (VIEs) consolidated under GAAP (Securitization entities income); and (v) includes distributions of profits from certain other limited partnership interests that were previously accounted for under the cost method, but are now accounted for at estimated fair value, where the change in estimated fair value is recognized in NIGL under GAAP (Certain partnership distributions); andOther revenues is adjusted for settlements of foreign currency earnings hedges and excludes fees received in association with services provided under transition service agreements (TSA fees).The following additional adjustments are made to expenses, in the line items indicated, in calculating adjusted expenses:Policyholder benefits and claims and policyholder dividends excludes: (i) amortization of basis adjustments associated with de-designated fair value hedges of future policy benefits (PBC hedge adjustments), (ii) changes in the policyholder dividend obligation related to NIGL and NDGL (PDO adjustments), (iii) inflation-indexed benefit adjustments associated with contracts backed by inflation-indexed investments and amounts associated with periodic crediting rate adjustments based on the total return of a contractually referenced pool of assets and other pass-through adjustments (Inflation and pass-through adjustments), (iv) benefits and hedging costs related to GMIBs (GMIB costs), and (v) market value adjustments associated with surrenders or terminations of contracts (Market value adjustments);Interest credited to policyholder account balances includes adjustments for earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives that are hedges of policyholder account balances but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment (PAB hedge adjustments) and excludes certain amounts related to net investment income earned on contractholder-directed equity securities (Unit-linked contract costs);Amortization of DAC and value of business acquired (VOBA) excludes amounts related to: (i) NIGL and NDGL, (ii) GMIB fees and GMIB costs and (iii) Market value adjustments;Amortization of negative VOBA excludes amounts related to Market value adjustments;Interest expense on debt excludes certain amounts related to securitization entities that are VIEs consolidated under GAAP (Securitization entities debt expense); andOther expenses excludes: (i) noncontrolling interests, (ii) implementation of new insurance regulatory requirements costs (Regulatory implementation costs), and (iii) acquisition, integration and other costs. Other expenses includes TSA fees.Adjusted earnings also excludes the recognition of certain contingent assets and liabilities that could not be recognized at acquisition or adjusted for during the measurement period under GAAP business combination accounting guidance.The tax impact of the adjustments mentioned above are calculated net of the U.S. or foreign statutory tax rate, which could differ from MetLife’s effective tax rate. Additionally, the provision for income tax (expense) benefit also includes the impact related to the timing of certain tax credits, as well as certain tax reforms.In addition, adjusted earnings available to common shareholders excludes the impact of preferred stock redemption premium, which is reported as a reduction to net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders.Investment portfolio gains (losses) and derivative gains (losses)These are measures of investment and hedging activity. Investment portfolio gains (losses) principally excludes amounts that are reported within net investment gains (losses) but do not relate to the performance of the investment portfolio, such as gains (losses) on sales and divestitures of businesses, as well as investment portfolio gains (losses) of divested businesses. Derivative gains (losses) principally excludes earned income on derivatives and amortization of premium on derivatives, where such derivatives are either hedges of investments or are used to replicate certain investments, and where such derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting. This earned income and amortization of premium is reported within adjusted earnings and not within derivative gains (losses).Return on equity, allocated equity, tangible equity and related measuresTotal MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA: total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding net unrealized investment gains (losses) and defined benefit plans adjustment components of AOCI, net of income tax.Total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding total notable items (excludes AOCI other than FCTA): total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding net unrealized investment gains (losses), defined benefit plans adjustment components of AOCI and total notable items, net of income tax.Return on MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity: net income (loss) available to MetLife, Inc.’s common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.’s average common stockholders’ equity.Adjusted return on MetLife, Inc.'s common stockholders' equity: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.'s average common stockholders' equity.Adjusted return on MetLife, Inc.'s common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders divided by MetLife, Inc.'s average common stockholders' equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA.Adjusted return on MetLife, Inc.'s common stockholders' equity, excluding total notable items (excludes AOCI other than FCTA): adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding total notable items, divided by MetLife, Inc.'s average common stockholders' equity, excluding total notable items (excludes AOCI other than FCTA).Allocated equity: portion of MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity that management allocates to each of its segments and sub-segments based on local capital requirements and economic capital. Economic capital is an internally developed risk capital model, the purpose of which is to measure the risk in the business and to provide a basis upon which capital is deployed. MetLife management periodically reviews this model to ensure that it remains consistent with emerging industry practice standards and the local capital requirements; allocated equity may be adjusted if warranted by such review. Allocated equity excludes the impact of AOCI other than FCTA.Adjusted return on allocated equity: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders divided by allocated equity. The above measures represent a level of equity consistent with the view that, in the ordinary course of business, MetLife does not plan to sell most investments for the sole purpose of realizing gains or losses.Total MetLife, Inc.’s tangible common stockholders’ equity or tangible equity: total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, reduced by the impact of goodwill, value of distribution agreements acquired (VODA) and value of customer relationships acquired (VOCRA), all net of income tax.Total MetLife, Inc.’s tangible common stockholders’ equity, adjusted for total notable items: total MetLife, Inc.’s common stockholders’ equity, excluding AOCI other than FCTA, reduced by the impact of goodwill, VODA, VOCRA and total notable items, all net of income tax.Adjusted return on MetLife, Inc.'s tangible common stockholders' equity: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding amortization of VODA and VOCRA, net of income tax, divided by MetLife, Inc.'s average tangible common stockholders' equity.Allocated tangible equity: allocated equity reduced by the impact of goodwill, VODA and VOCRA, all net of income tax.Adjusted return on allocated tangible equity: adjusted earnings available to common shareholders, excluding amortization of VODA and VOCRA, net of income tax, divided by allocated tangible equity.The above measures are, when considered in conjunction with regulatory capital ratios, a measure of capital adequacy.Expense ratio, direct expense ratio, adjusted expense ratio and related measuresExpense ratio: other expenses, net of capitalization of DAC, divided by premiums, fees and other revenues.Direct expense ratio: adjusted direct expenses, divided by adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues.Direct expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses and PRT: adjusted direct expenses, excluding total notable items related to direct expenses, divided by adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding PRT.Adjusted expense ratio: adjusted other expenses, net of adjusted capitalization of DAC, divided by adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues.Adjusted expense ratio, excluding total notable items related to adjusted other expenses and PRT: adjusted other expenses, net of adjusted capitalization of DAC, excluding total notable items related to adjusted other expenses, divided by adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues, excluding PRT.Asia General account (GA) assets under management (GA AUM) and related measuresAsia GA AUM is used by MetLife to describe assets in its Asia GA investment portfolio which are actively managed and stated at estimated fair value. Asia GA AUM is comprised of Asia GA total investments and cash and cash equivalents, excluding policy loans, contractholder-directed equity securities, fair value option securities and certain other invested assets, as substantially all of these assets are not actively managed in MetLife’s Asia GA investment portfolio. Mortgage loans (including commercial, agricultural and residential) and real estate and real estate joint ventures included in Asia GA AUM (at net asset value, net of deduction for encumbering debt) have been adjusted from carrying value to estimated fair value. At the segment level, intersegment balances (intercompany activity, primarily related to investments in subsidiaries, that eliminate at the MetLife consolidated level) are excluded from Asia GA AUM.Asia GA AUM (at amortized cost) excludes the following adjustments: (i) unrealized gain (loss) on investments carried at estimated fair value and (ii) adjustments from carrying value to estimated fair value on mortgage loans (including commercial, agricultural and residential) and real estate and real estate joint ventures. Asia GA AUM (at amortized cost) is presented net of related allowance for credit loss.Statistical sales information:U.S.:Group Benefits: calculated using 10% of single premium deposits and 100% of annualized full-year premiums and fees from recurring premium policy sales of all products.Retirement and Income Solutions: calculated using 10% of single premium deposits and 100% of annualized full-year premiums and fees only from recurring premium policy sales of specialized benefit resources and corporate-owned life insurance.Latin America, Asia and EMEA: calculated using 10% of single-premium deposits (mainly from retirement products such as variable annuity, fixed annuity and pensions), 20% of single-premium deposits from credit insurance and 100% of annualized full-year premiums and fees from recurring-premium policy sales of all products (mainly from risk and protection products such as individual life, accident &amp; health and group).Sales statistics do not correspond to revenues under GAAP, but are used as relevant measures of business activity.The following additional information is relevant to an understanding of MetLife’s performance results and outlook:Volume growth, as discussed in the context of business growth, is the period over period percentage change in adjusted earnings available to common shareholders attributable to adjusted premiums, fees and other revenues and assets under management levels, applying a model in which certain margins and factors are held constant. The most significant of such items are underwriting margins, investment margins, changes in equity market performance, expense margins and the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates.Holding company cash and liquid assets are held by MetLife, Inc. collectively with other MetLife holding companies and include cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and publicly traded securities excluding assets that are pledged or otherwise committed. Assets pledged or otherwise committed include amounts received in connection with securities lending, repurchase agreements, derivatives, regulatory deposits, the collateral financing arrangement, funding agreements and secured borrowings, as well as amounts held in the closed block.MetLife uses a measure of free cash flow to facilitate an understanding of its ability to generate cash for reinvestment into its businesses or use in non-mandatory capital actions. MetLife defines free cash flow as the sum of cash available at MetLife’s holding companies from dividends from operating subsidiaries, expenses and other net flows of the holding companies (including capital contributions to subsidiaries), and net contributions from debt to be at or below target leverage ratios. This measure of free cash flow is prior to capital actions, such as common stock dividends and repurchases, debt reduction and mergers and acquisitions. Free cash flow should not be viewed as a substitute for net cash provided by (used in) operating activities calculated in accordance with GAAP. The free cash flow ratio is typically expressed as a percentage of annual adjusted earnings available to common shareholders.Notable items reflect the unexpected impact of events that affect MetLife’s results, but that were unknown and that MetLife could not anticipate when it devised its business plan. Notable items also include certain items regardless of the extent anticipated in the business plan, to help investors have a better understanding of MetLife's results and to evaluate and forecast those results. Notable items represent a positive (negative) impact to adjusted earnings available to common shareholders.We refer to observable forward yield curves as of a particular date in connection with making our estimates for future results. The observable forward yield curves at a given time are based on implied future interest rates along a range of interest rate durations. This includes the 10-year U.S. Treasury rate which we use as a benchmark rate to describe longer-term interest rates used in our estimates for future results.Not Meaningful (NM) indicates a percentage change in a financial metric over a specified period of time and reflects changes in factors that are subject to volatility, and should not, accordingly be viewed as representative of a reasonable trend currently or in the future.

[EIA/S]That sent the dollar higher on Thursday, with Powell indicating that U.S. rates are likely to peak above current investor expectations.A strong dollar reduces demand for oil by making it more expensive for buyers using other currencies.""Oil is battling both a weakening global economic outlook and a surging dollar. It seems these bearish drivers won't be easing up anytime soon,"" said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at data and analytics firm OANDA.The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits unexpectedly fell last week, suggesting the labor market remains strong despite slowing domestic demand amid the Fed's hefty rate hikes to tame inflation.The United States is not the only country tightening policy.The Bank of England raised interest rates by the most since 1989 but also warned Britain faced a long recession.""Rising anxiety about stalling growth will inevitably impact global oil demand and another downward revision in the next set of forecasts is not a far-fetched idea,"" said PVM Oil analyst Tamas Varga.STRICT COVID CONTAINMENTIn China, meanwhile, COVID-19 cases hit their highest level in two and a half months after the health authority stuck by its strict containment policy, dampening investor hopes for an easing of curbs battering the world's second-largest economy.Story continuesIn addition, China's natural gas consumption may post the first decline in 2022 in two decades amid a struggling economy, with demand this winter set to rise more modestly than in previous years, state energy officials said.Chinese policymakers pledged on Wednesday that growth was still a priority.Oil price losses, however, were limited by expectations the market is set to tighten in the coming months.The European Union's (EU) embargo on Russian oil over its invasion of Ukraine is set to start on Dec. 5 and will be followed by a halt on oil product imports in February.Lower output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) also lent price support, with a Reuters survey finding the producer group's output fell in October for the first time since June.OPEC and its allies including Russia, known collectively as OPEC+, decided in early October to cut targeted output by 2 million barrels per day from this month.(Additional reporting by Arpan Varghese and Muyu Xu in Singapore, and Ahmad Ghaddar in London; Editing by David Goodman, Mark Potter and Paul Simao)]"

But lack of official word on the matter swiftly reversed this.Slowing crude demand in China weighed on oil prices this year, as a series of COVID lockdowns ground local economic activity to a halt. China's crude imports have fallen steadily this year, with the country also increasing its oil export quotas on weakening local demand.Brent oil futures fell 0.4% to $95.79 a barrel after clearing $96 in the prior session, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell 0.6% to $89.44 a barrel by 22:35 ET (02:35 GMT). Both contracts rallied in the prior session as data showed a bigger-than-expected draw in U.S. inventories.But offsetting this, the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates sharply on Wednesday, with Chairman Jerome Powell warning that rates will likely be higher than initially expected, due to stubborn inflation.Strength in the U.S. economy, which has so far kept oil demand steady, also gives the Fed more economic headroom to keep raising rates.Elsewhere, the Bank of England is also set to hike rates by at least 75 basis points later on Thursday.Rising interest rates were the biggest weight on oil prices this year, as markets feared that a global recession will severely crimp crude demand. Higher U.S. interest rates also boosted the dollar, making commodities priced in the greenback more expensive and hurting import demand.Story continuesBut oil prices regained some lost ground in recent months on the prospect of tightening supply.In addition to the U.S. inventory data, rising geopolitical tensions in the Middle East also benefited crude prices, after a report suggested that Iran plans to attack major oil producer Saudi Arabia. Such a scenario is likely to disrupt oil supply.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, which recently cut production, has also vowed to support crude prices with more supply cuts if necessary. The cartel recently hiked its medium to long-term demand outlook, stating that a global transition away from fossil fuels will take much longer than anticipated.Related ArticlesOil Falls on Weak Chinese Data, Hawkish Fed Also WeighsUkraine grain export deal resumes days after Russia suspends involvementOil slips as dollar firms, but supply worries check losses]"

All declined to be named as the information is confidential.Some of the cuts will come from capital markets teams in Hong Kong and mainland China, and most of the rest are expected to be from other teams focusing on China business, both onshore and offshore, the third source said.One of the sources said the bank's 30-plus technology investment banking team in Asia Pacific will also be affected by the cuts.The cuts in Asia Pacific will be greater than the bank's annual staff losses from natural attrition in the region, the three sources said, adding that a final decision on the size of the cuts is yet to be taken.Global cuts will be made around the same time, they added.A fourth source said the bank has yet to make decisions about the scale or timing of any layoffs, adding that layoffs are not imminent. Any cuts would represent a low-single digit percentage of staff globally, this person said.Morgan Stanley, which had 81,567 employees globally at the end of the third quarter, according to a company filing, declined to comment for the story.With prospects for arranging and financing deals drying up, some investment banks are firming up plans to cut jobs.Goldman Sachs cut jobs in September after pausing the annual practice for two years during the pandemic, Reuters has reported. Deutsche Bank also cut staff last month in origination and advisory segments of its investment banking unit.CHINA IMPACTMorgan Stanley's headcount reduction plans in Asia come as China's strict COVID-19 restrictions are weighing on its economy, which has taken a toll on capital markets and merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) activity.Story continuesHong Kong, the preferred IPO venue for Chinese companies, has handled $10.77 billion of listings so far in 2022, the lowest level since 2017, compared with $37.7 billion at the same time last year, according to Refinitiv figures.M&amp;A transaction values involving China plunged by 35% year-on-year to $266 billion in the first nine months of the year, to the lowest level since 2013, Refinitiv data showed, although it remains Asia's largest deals market.Morgan Stanley last month reported a 30% slump in third-quarter profit, missing analysts' estimate as a slowdown in global dealmaking hurt its investment bank business. It hinted that some cost-cutting actions were on the radar.""We're looking at headcount,"" Chairman and Chief Executive James Gorman said in a conference call last month, without providing details.""You've got to take into account the rate of growth we've had in the last few years, and we've learned some things through COVID about how we can operate more efficiently.""Gorman is currently in Hong Kong at a high-profile financial summit aimed at re-opening the city to international investors after nearly three years of strict COVID restrictions.He said at a panel discussion Wednesday the biggest risk the world currently faced was the high level of inflation.Morgan Stanley has slipped four places to rank 14th in the Asia Pacific, excluding Japan, investment banking fee league table so far this year, raking in $329 million with a 1.4% market share, as per Refinitiv data.(Reporting by Kane Wu and Julie Zhu in Hong Kong, Scott Murdoch in Sydney and Lananh Nguyen in New York; Editing by Sumeet Chatterjee and Richard Pullin)]"

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the global and U.S. logistics industries and proceed to the top logistics companies in USA, you can go directly to Top 5 Logistics Companies in USA.The Logistics Industry: An AnalysisThe global logistics industry is responsible for the movement of goods around the world. It is a vital part of the global economy, and its success is dependent on the efficient and reliable transportation of goods. The industry has been growing in recent years, due to the increase in global trade. This has led to a demand for more efficient and reliable logistics services. The industry is expected to continue to grow in the future, as the global economy expands.The logistics industry is made up of a number of different players, from the giant multinational corporations that own the ships and planes, to the smaller companies that move goods around on the ground. In between these two extremes are the freight forwarders, who act as the middlemen, coordinating the movement of goods and ensuring that they arrive at their destination on time.According to an industry analysis report by a top-rated American market research company, Expert Market Research, the global logistics industry was valued at $9.5 trillion in 2021 and is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 5.7% through 2027, attaining a value of $13.3 trillion by the end of the forecasted period.There are a number of trends that are impacting the global logistics industry. One of the most notable is the rise of e-commerce and the corresponding increase in demand for last-mile delivery services. This has led to a number of new players entering the market, as well as a number of traditional logistics providers expanding their operations to include last-mile delivery services. Another trend that is having an impact on the logistics industry is the increasing focus on sustainability.

Despite the strong results over the past few quarters, the stock peaked back in November of 2021 as investors have begun trying to time the end of the economic cycle, using Landstar as a proxy for economic activity. We are less concerned about where we are in this particular macroeconomic cycle, not only because the market has already discounted a slowdown but also because the underinvestment in long-haul drivers has been a multi-decade phenomenon that will not likely be solved even if consumer demand normalizes over the next few quarters. We think Landstar should generate excess returns over time because it has been one of the few companies that has been steadily investing in drivers while there has not been a concomitant increase in competitive capacity.”7.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out George Soros Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Large-Cap Stock Picks. George Soros, a Hungarian-American businessman, founded Soros Fund Management in 1970. Soros Fund Management is a New York-based hedge fund which carved its place as one of the most profitable funds on Wall Street, however, it is now structured as a family office. The George Soros stock portfolio is worth $5.6 billion as of the second quarter of 2022, and the billionaire makes highly leveraged investments keeping in mind the currency movements and commodity prices, as well as fundamental macroeconomic and market analysis. The condition of the housing market also plays an important role in his investment decisions. Soros tends to invest in large-cap, small-cap, exchange traded funds, and both growth and value plays. Large-cap stocks are usually perceived as less risky. These tend to be companies that are very stable and dominate their respective sectors, with market capitalization ranging from $10 billion to $200 billion. These prominent firms have fortress balance sheets and the ability to withstand market volatility. Large-cap companies also usually return a percentage of their profits to shareholders as dividends, which helps investors navigate a downturn in the economy relatively better. Some of the best large-cap stocks in the George Soros stock portfolio are Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Our Methodology We selected the top large-cap stock picks from George Soros’ stock portfolio as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. George Soros Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Large-Cap Stock PicksGeorge Soros Stock Portfolio: Top Large-Cap Stock Picks10. Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) is a Colorado-based communications company that provides a range of wireless, data, video, voice, and managed services to residential customers, businesses, government entities, and educational and medical institutions. In Q2 2022, the George Soros stock portfolio had 1.75 million shares of Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA), worth $202.35 million and representing 3.6% of the total 13F securities. Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) has been part of the Soros portfolio since the second quarter of 2016. Story continuesOn May 10, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft maintained a Buy recommendation on Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $158 from $196.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) was part of 27 public stock portfolios, compared to 26 in the prior quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management held the leading position in the company, comprising 8.30 million shares worth $960.2 million. Like Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) is one of the top large-cap picks from the George Soros stock portfolio. Alphyn Capital made the following comment about Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In retrospect, I wish I had cut the position in Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) more aggressively last quarter. Fears of fixed wireless and fiber competition have weighed heavily on Charter and Liberty’s share prices. Tom Rutledge’s unexpected early retirement from the CEO role has not helped matters.I believe the sentiment is now overly pessimistic, and the valuation once again attractive. Revenue growth from broadband ads will likely stall as fixed wireless access programs take a bite out of cable subscribers over the next five years. 4 However, Charter has a fast-growing mobile phone business through an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Verizon. Given its cost-effective access to Verizon’s mobile telephony infrastructure, it provides a branded mobile phone service to retail customers at competitive rates. For example, Unlimited pricing starts at $29.99/month, including taxes and fees, vs. $35-55/month plus taxes and fees for Verizon’s plans.Wireless generates approximately $725m in revenues for Charter per quarter, around 6% of the total, and is growing 40% per year. Should this continue, Wireless could return Charter to mid-single-digit revenue growth and “drive meaningful EBITDA for Charter,” as revenues scale over a low cost base. With approximately 25m non-Charter potential wireless customers within the area it serves, there is plenty of room for growth.”9. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a California-based company that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles and related accessories. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is the largest holding in the George Soros stock portfolio, with 17.8 million shares worth $459 million, representing 8.17% of the total securities. Soros Fund Management added Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) to its portfolio in the last quarter of 2021. On October 11, after a conversation with the management, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh said that Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)’s vehicle recall is ""relatively minor"" and that its manufacturing lines have already been updated. He believes Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) has seen the issue on ""less than 1%"" of vehicles and the company forecasts the cost of fixing the recall to be ""minimal"". The analyst noted that the headlines are ""worse than reality"" and maintained a Buy rating on the shares with a $65 price target.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 35 funds reported owning stakes worth $1.6 billion in Rivian Automotive, Inc.

(NASDAQ:RIVN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Rivian Automotive, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells consumer and commercial electric vehicles. Shares of Rivian declined 48.2% in the second quarter as investors continued rotating out of long-duration assets and have become increasingly concerned about capital intensity and cash burn.At the same time, Rivian continues to be impacted by supply chain issues which are causing delays in its production ramp. Rivian is addressing those challenges by diversifying its supply chain to alleviate shortages while also consolidating the number of variants in development to reduce cash burn (the company guided that current cash will be enough to support the company’s future platform launch ‘R2’ in 2025). Rivian recently reported stronger-than-expected second quarter production numbers while reiterating its annual guidance of producing 25,000 units.As semiconductor shortages ease, we believe that the company will be able to rapidly ramp its production. We retain conviction in the shares given management’s vision, Rivian’s product positioning, the company’s relationship with Amazon.com, and its strong balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, Rivian had $17 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which will help it overcome the current challenges while taking advantage of the long-term opportunity as the market transitions to electric vehicles.”8. Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) was founded in 2011 and is based in Dublin, Ireland.

Aptiv provides a range of solutions for the auto industry, including autonomous driving technologies, safety technologies, components, and wiring. The large exposure of APTV to EVs should lead to long-term value as EVs continue their growth, boosted by their relative attractiveness as prices at the pump hit near-historic highs.”7. D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is a Texas-based homebuilding company that constructs and sells residential homes under the D.R.

(NYSE:DHI), worth $197 million and representing 3.5% of the total holdings. Raymond James analyst Buck Horne on October 21 downgraded D.R. Horton, Inc.

Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is the largest homebuilder in the US by volume (the company sold more than 90k homes in the past year) with a well-recognized focus on delivering quality product at the entry-level price point (its average selling price is less than $400k) and market-leading positions in key Sunbelt markets.While the near-term outlook for DR Horton remains uncertain given the adjustments occurring in the US residential markets, the medium-to-long-term prospects for volume-based homebuilders with super-strong balance sheets and scale advantages continue to be promising in Fund Management’s view. More specifically, (i) residential inventories remain around record-low levels in most major markets when gauged by aggregate units available (see chart below), (ii) demand for single-family residences seem to have multiple secular drivers as the largest generation in US history (the “millennial cohort”) enters its prime home buying years and desires more space not only due to “life events” but also “remote” and “hybrid” working arrangements, and (iii) significant inflation in rental rates for multi-family units in urban areas has left the rent-to-own proposition for single-family homes in suburban areas in a compelling range (particularly in the Sunbelt region which is experiencing outsized job growth and wage growth relative to broader national figures).In Fund Management’s view, the two industry participants that seem most likely to take part in this shift include DR Horton and Lennar Corp. (a long-held position in the Fund). In conjunction, these two “blue-chip builders” now account for approximately 10% of the Fund’s capital, as well as roughly one out of every five new homes built in the Sunbelt. They would also qualify under Third Avenue Founder Marty Whitman’s “Safe and Cheap” maxim as both companies are nearly “net-cash” (i.e., more cash than debt) with common stocks trading at less than five times trailing earnings, on average.”6.

This company, which is in the Zacks Computer - Software industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This customer-management software developer has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 11.02%.For the most recent quarter, Salesforce.com was expected to post earnings of $1.02 per share, but it reported $1.19 per share instead, representing a surprise of 16.67%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.93 per share, while it actually produced $0.98 per share, a surprise of 5.38%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Salesforce.com, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Salesforce.com has an Earnings ESP of +7.13% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.

However, October data suggests that fewer home shoppers could afford to take advantage of the rise in available inventory, with time on market continuing to climb amid still-high listing prices.""As the rapid runup in rates reshapes housing market dynamics this fall, both buyers and sellers are taking a step back to recalibrate their plans. Home shoppers are looking at a monthly mortgage payment that is roughly $1,000 higher than at this time last year, and incomes are rising but not by that much. Combined with asking prices that are still climbing at a double-digit yearly pace, the average American has taken a huge hit to their homebuying power,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""Still, our data indicates that some aspiring homeowners are finding ways to make the most of inventory conditions, such as by exploring relatively affordable metros. For buyers with the flexibility, relocating to a lower-priced market could help offset higher mortgage costs. There's also a takeaway for sellers in these areas – on a well-priced home, you could still see strong interest from these out-of-towners.""October 2022 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over Oct. 2021Change over Oct. 2020Change over Oct. 2019 Median listing price13.3% (to $425,000)21.8 %37.1 %Active listings33.5 %2.8 %-37.6 %New listings-15.9 %-23.1 %-16.3 %Median days on market6 days (to 51 days)5 days-18 days Share of active listingswith price reductions10.3 percentage points(to 20.9%)10.7 percentage points(from 10.2% in 2020)3.9 percentage points(from 17.0% in 2019)Inventory recovery accelerates amid higher rates and moderating demandIn October, the U.S. supply of active listings grew at a record-fast1 annual pace and surpassed 2020 levels for the first time, even as new sellers declined year-over-year for the fifth consecutive month. Additionally, pending listings, or homes under contract with a buyer, continued to drop. These trends indicate that October's accelerated inventory improvements were largely due to moderating buyer demand, fueled by mortgage costs that are rising at a faster pace than inflation and incomes. While some softening in seller participation is typical in the fall, this year's significant new listings declines reflect the impact of home shoppers' diminished buying power on seller sentiment. However, sellers may still see strong buyer competition for fewer options in some regions, with inventory still lagging October 2020 levels in the Northeast and Midwest, regions where home sales declines have also been more modest.Story continuesNationally, active inventory grew 33.5% year-over-year in October, reaching the highest level in 24 months. Meanwhile, both newly-listed homes (-15.9%) and pending listings (-30.0%) declined year-over-year.Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, 42 markets posted yearly active inventory gains in October, led by Phoenix (+173.9%), Raleigh, N.C. (+167.4%) and Nashville, Tenn. (+145.0%). The number of for-sale homes was still down year-over-year in the remaining eight markets, by the largest amounts in Hartford, Conn. (-25.7%), Virginia Beach, Va. (-11.0%) Milwaukee (-9.6%) and Chicago (-9.6%).On average across the 50 largest metros, no regions saw year-over-year new listing increases in October, with the greatest declines registered in the West (-20.6%), followed by the Northeast (-17.4%), Midwest (-15.0%) and South (-9.8%). Furthermore, newly-listed homes increased in just four markets: Nashville, Tenn. (+10.5%), New Orleans (+6.2%), Dallas (+5.6%) and San Antonio (+1.4%).Compared to October 2020, active inventory was higher in 32 of the 50 biggest markets, led by western (+33.9%) and southern metros (+7.2%): Phoenix (+132.0%), Austin, Texas (+120.8%), Riverside, Calif. (+67.2%), Memphis, Tenn. (+59.7%) and Nashville (+55.7%). Inventory remained lower than two years ago in the Northeast (-21.1%) and Midwest (-7.9%).Competition stalls as home listing prices and time on market hold steadyWith home sales activity declining along with affordability in October, national trends reflected a market in which competition continued at a cooler pace than during this year's summer peak. However, compared to last month, there was little change in both listing prices and time on market. This may be partly attributed to regional variations in supply and demand dynamics, with still-strong home shopper interest in relatively affordable markets balancing out the slowdown in other areas. In the Midwest and Northeast, where buyers saw relatively smaller inventory improvements in October, time on market and the share of homes with price reductions posted smaller year-over-year increases than in other regions.In October, national listing price trends were relatively unchanged from the prior month, with the median listing price dipping just $2,000 to $425,000. Additionally, annual home listing price growth decelerated just slightly, to 13.3% from 13.9% in September.On average across the 50 largest U.S. metros, yearly listing price growth entered single-digit territory in October (+9.2%). However, for-sale home prices continued to rise by double-digits year-over-year in 20 markets, led by Milwaukee (+34.5%), Miami (+25.1%) and Kansas City (+21.4%).The share of homes with price reductions was up 10.3 percentage points to 20.9% in October, well above 2017 (18.1%) and 2019 (17.0%) levels, but just under the 2018 share (21.2%). Western (+18.9 percentage points) and southern metros (+13.6 percentage points) posted the greatest increases in the share of price reductions: Phoenix (+35.9 percentage points), Austin (+31.2 percentage points) and Las Vegas (+24.4 percentage points).The typical home spent 51 days on the market in October, six days more than last year, but still 20 days faster than the typical 2017-2019 pace. The metros where homes spent longest on the market compared to October 2021 were Raleigh (+27 days), Austin (+26 days), Phoenix (+21 days) and Las Vegas (+21 days).Time on market declined year-over-year in October in 10 of the 50 largest metros, led by New Orleans (-21 days), where last year's pace was impacted by Hurricane Ida, followed by Richmond, Va. (-15 days) and Birmingham, Ala. (-6 days).Spotlight On: Higher housing costs fuel demand from out-of-town home shoppersSimilar to October's for-sale housing trends, the Realtor.com® Q3 Cross-Market Demand Report also released today highlights regional variations in homebuying activity. With rising rates pushing the typical monthly mortgage payment up 77.1% in October compared to a year ago, some buyers are potentially trying to add room in their budgets by searching further from where they live for lower-priced homes.Nationwide in Q3 2022, 60.7% of listings views on Realtor.com® came from users located outside of the listing's metro, compared to 56.9% during the prior quarter and 52.1% at the same time last year. Regionally, northeastern (69.0%) and western (65.7%) home shoppers were most likely to search out-of-market in Q3.

83,fda8f5cc-1de6-302d-aeeb-3c0c96ba765b,NWS,2022-11-03,An Intrinsic Calculation For News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) Suggests It's 48% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-news-corporation-nasdaq-165429909.html,1667408069.0,STORY,['NWSA'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for News The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$833.2mUS$900.1mUS$943.9mUS$1.11bUS$1.09bUS$1.08bUS$1.08bUS$1.09bUS$1.10bUS$1.11bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ -0.79%Est @ 0.04%Est @ 0.62%Est @ 1.03%Est @ 1.31% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$779US$788US$773US$851US$779US$723US$677US$637US$602US$571(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.2bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.0%) = US$23bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$23b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$12bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$19b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$17.0, the company appears quite undervalued at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at News as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.959. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

The transaction is subject to customary terms and conditions, including closing adjustments, and is expected to close by year-end 2022.(PRNewsfoto/Marathon Oil Corporation)HighlightsImmediate double-digit accretion to key financial metrics and shareholder distributions consistent with Return of Capital Framework; anticipate raising base dividend an additional 11% post-close Adds significant high return, high working interest inventory that immediately competes for capital and is accretive to Marathon Oil inventory lifeCompelling industrial logic that significantly increases Eagle Ford scale by nearly doubling Marathon Oil's Basin position with high working interest acreage adjacent to the Company's legacy positionExecuting transaction while maintaining low leverage and investment grade balance sheet""This acquisition in the core of the Eagle Ford satisfies every element of our exacting acquisition criteria, uniquely striking the right balance between immediate cash flow accretion and future development opportunity,"" said chairman, president, and CEO Lee Tillman. ""The transaction is immediately accretive to our key financial metrics; it will drive higher distributions to our shareholders consistent with our operating cash flow driven Return of Capital Framework; it's accretive to our inventory life with high rate-of-return locations that immediately compete for capital; and it offers compelling industrial logic by nearly doubling our position in a Basin where we have a tremendous track record of execution excellence. Importantly, we expect to execute this transaction while maintaining our investment grade balance sheet and while still delivering on our aggressive return of capital objectives in 2022 and beyond.""Story continuesStrategic RationaleSignificant Financial Accretion: The transaction is immediately and significantly accretive to Marathon Oil's key financial metrics, expected to drive a 17% increase to 2023 operating cash flow1 and a 15% increase to free cash flow1. The transaction was acquired at approximately 3.4x 2023 EBITDA1 and a 17% free cash flow yield1, accretive relative to Marathon Oil's 2023 stand-alone metrics at the same price deck (4.7x EV/EBITDA2, 13% FCF Yield2). Enhances Return of Capital Profile: As the transaction is accretive to Marathon Oil's cash flow profile, it will immediately enhance shareholder distributions, consistent with the Company's transparent Return of Capital Framework that is uniquely driven by operating cash flow and, in a $60/bbl WTI or higher price environment, calls for at least 40% of annual operating cash flow to be returned to equity holders. More specifically, Marathon Oil expects the transaction to increase 2023 shareholder distribution capacity by approximately 17%1. Additionally, due to the cash flow accretive nature of the transaction, Marathon Oil expects to raise its quarterly base dividend an additional 11% post transaction close to 10ct/sh. Importantly, for full year 2022, Marathon Oil still expects to meet its objective to return at least 50% of adjusted operating cash flow to shareholders, outperforming its 40% framework minimum.Compelling Industrial Logic Expands Scale and is Accretive to Inventory Life and Quality: The transaction significantly expands Marathon Oil's Eagle Ford position through the addition of 130,000 net acres with 97% working interest located primarily in the prolific condensate and wet gas phase windows of the play. The Company estimates it is acquiring more than 600 undrilled locations, representing an inventory life greater than 15 years, with inventory that immediately competes for capital in the Marathon Oil portfolio. The acreage is adjacent to Marathon Oil's existing Eagle Ford position, enabling the Company to further leverage its knowledge, experience, and operating strengths in the Basin, while materially increasing its Basin scale to 290,000 net acres and contributing to optimized supply chain accessibility and cost control in a tight service market. The acquisition also includes 700 existing wells, most of which were completed before 2015 with early generation completion designs. These existing locations offer upside redevelopment potential, none of which was considered in the Company's valuation of the asset or inventory count.Maintaining Investment Grade Balance Sheet: Marathon Oil expects to fund the transaction with a combination of cash on hand, borrowings on the company's revolving credit facility, and new prepayable debt. The Company does not expect the transaction to meaningfully affect its leverage profile, continuing to expect a net debt to EBITDA ratio of less than one3, and coupled with enhanced enterprise scale anticipates positive credit quality implications.Additional Transaction DetailsThe 130,000 net acres (99% operated, 97% working interest) Marathon Oil is acquiring from Ensign Natural Resources span Live Oak, Bee, Karnes, and Dewitt Counties across the condensate, wet gas, and dry gas phase windows of the Eagle Ford. Estimated fourth quarter 2022 oil equivalent production is 67,000 net boed (22,000 net bopd of oil). Marathon Oil believes it can hold fourth quarter production flat with approximately 1 rig and 35 to 40 wells to sales per year. The Company's valuation of the asset was based off this maintenance level program and does not include any synergy credits or upside redevelopment opportunity. The transaction is expected to close by year-end 2022 with an effective date of Oct. 1, 2022. Acquired tangible assets are eligible for full expensing for the purpose of income tax optimization.AdvisorsMorgan Stanley is serving as lead financial advisor to Marathon Oil and is providing committed financing to Marathon Oil with respect to a portion of the purchase price.

Adjusted net income was $832 million or $1.24 per diluted share. Net operating cash flow was $1,556 million or $1,440 million before changes in working capital (adjusted CFO).

""We returned a record $1.2 billion of capital to our shareholders during third quarter, clearly demonstrating our commitment to provide investors with the first call on cash flow through our unique percentage of operating cash flow framework. Since achieving our leverage objective in October 2021, we have reduced our share count by a peer-leading 20%, driving significant growth in our per share metrics while also funding our latest base dividend increase. We have also entered into a purchase agreement to acquire an Eagle Ford asset that will essentially double our net acreage, is immediately accretive to our key financial metrics and return of capital framework, and is accretive to inventory life with significant inventory that immediately competes for capital – all while maintaining very low leverage. Looking ahead to 2023, while the macro environment will likely remain volatile, our commitment to our Framework for Success is steadfast. Our case to beat is a maintenance capital program that integrates our recently announced Eagle Ford acquisition, as we will continue to prioritize strong corporate returns, sustainable free cash flow generation, significant return of capital to shareholders and ESG excellence.""Story continuesReturn of CapitalMarathon Oil's percentage of CFO framework provides clear visibility to significant return of capital to equity investors and ensures the shareholder gets the first call on cash flow generation. In a $60/bbl WTI or higher price environment, the Company targets returning a minimum of 40% of CFO to equity investors. For 2022 specifically, Marathon Oil expects to exceed 50% of CFO to shareholders.During third quarter, Marathon Oil returned 82% of adjusted CFO (over 100% of adjusted FCF) to equity investors. Third quarter return of capital totaled $1,176 million, a record for quarterly shareholder distributions, and included $1,122 million of share repurchases and $54 million base dividend. Over the trailing four quarters, the Company has consistently outperformed its minimum return of capital objective, with shareholder distributions accounting for 63%1 of adjusted CFO (83%2 of adjusted FCF). Similarly, Marathon Oil has returned 61% of adjusted CFO to shareholders through the first three quarters of 2022 (83% of adjusted FCF).Since achieving its leverage objective in Oct. 2021 and stepping up return of capital to equity investors, Marathon Oil has repurchased $3.4 billion of its common stock (157 million shares), driving a 20% reduction to its outstanding share count and contributing to significant growth in all per share metrics. The Board of Directors increased Marathon Oil's outstanding share repurchase authorization to $2.5 billion as of Nov. 2, underscoring the Company's ongoing commitment to its return of capital program.Marathon Oil also raised its quarterly base dividend by 13% to $0.09/sh, with the per share increase funded through the year-to-date share count reduction from the Company's stock buyback program. This represents the sixth base dividend increase in the last seven quarters for a cumulative increase of 200% since the beginning of 2021.3Q22 FinancialsCASH FLOW AND CAPEX: Net cash provided by operations was $1,556 million during third quarter or $1,440 million before changes in working capital. Third quarter cash additions to property, plant and equipment totaled $430 million, while capital expenditures (accrued) totaled $413 million.FREE CASH FLOW: Free cash flow was $1,126 million or $1,031 million of adjusted free cash flow before changes in working capital and including E.G. distributions.BALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY: Marathon Oil ended third quarter with $1,109 million in cash and cash equivalents, essentially flat with the prior quarter cash balance. In July, the Company extended its revolving credit facility by three years to 2027 and amended the capacity to $2.5 billion.ADJUSTMENTS TO NET INCOME: The adjustments to net income for third quarter increased net income by $15 million, primarily due to dry well expense and impairments associated with onshore exploration partly offset by the income impact associated with unrealized gains on derivative instruments.3Q22 OperationsUNITED STATES (U.S.): U.S. production averaged 295,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) for third quarter 2022. Oil production averaged 166,000 net barrels of oil per day (bopd). The Company brought a total of 70 gross Company-operated wells to sales during third quarter, in comparison to guidance for approximately 60 to 70 wells to sales. U.S. unit production costs increased to $6.40 per boe during third quarter due to inflation, including higher commodity prices, and an elevated level of high-return workover activity.Marathon Oil's third quarter production in the Eagle Ford averaged 90,000 net boed, including 61,000 net bopd of oil, with 48 gross Company-operated wells to sales, above guidance of 40 to 45 wells to sales. In the Bakken, production averaged 118,000 net boed, including 75,000 net bopd of oil, with 9 gross Company-operated wells to sales. In Oklahoma, production averaged 54,000 net boed, including 12,000 net bopd of oil. Northern Delaware production averaged 24,000 net boed, including 13,000 net bopd of oil, with 13 gross Company-operated wells to sales, the highest number of quarterly wells to sales for the asset since 2019. Third quarter Northern Delaware wells to sales included 8 extended laterals (~10,000 feet) with an average 30-day IP rate of 2,740 BOED (72% oil).INTERNATIONAL: Equatorial Guinea production averaged 57,000 net boed for third quarter 2022, including 10,000 net bopd of oil. Unit production costs averaged $3.55 per boe. Net income from equity method investees totaled $190 million and total cash distributions from equity method companies amounted to $150 million during third quarter in the form of dividends and return of capital.2022 GuidanceMarathon Oil raised its E.G. equity income guidance to $610 million at the midpoint from prior guidance of $540 million, due to strong operational performance and the Company's differentiated exposure to the increase in European natural gas pricing. The Company has raised its 2022 capital spending guidance to $1.4 billion from prior guidance of $1.3 billion, due to incremental inflation and targeted efforts to protect execution excellence and operational momentum into 2023. The Company forecasts a 2022 reinvestment rate of approximately 25%3 at recent forward curve commodity pricing, among the lowest in the E&amp;P sector.A slide deck and Quarterly Investor Packet will be posted to the Company's website following this release today, Nov. 2.

Our presentation of adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted net income (loss) is defined as net income (loss) adjusted for gains or losses on dispositions, impairments of proved and certain unproved properties, goodwill and equity method investments, changes in our valuation allowance, unrealized derivative gains or losses on commodity and interest rate derivative instruments, effects of pension settlements and curtailments and other items that could be considered ""non-operating"" or ""non-core"" in nature. Management believes this is useful to investors as another tool to meaningfully represent our operating performance and to compare Marathon to certain competitors. Adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted net income (loss) per share should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) or net income (loss) per share as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Our presentation of adjusted CFO is defined as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for changes in working capital and is a non-GAAP measure. Management believes this is useful to investors as an indicator of Marathon's ability to generate cash quarterly or year-to-date by eliminating differences caused by the timing of certain working capital items. Adjusted CFO should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Our presentation of free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure. Free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities and cash additions to property, plant and equipment. Management believes this is useful to investors as a measure of Marathon's ability to fund its capital expenditure programs, service debt, and fund other distributions to stockholders. Free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Our presentation of adjusted free cash flow is a non-GAAP measure. Adjusted free cash flow before dividend (""adjusted free cash flow"") is defined as adjusted CFO, capital expenditures (accrued), and EG return of capital and other. Management believes this is useful to investors as a measure of Marathon's ability to fund its capital expenditure programs, service debt, and fund other distributions to stockholders. Adjusted free cash flow should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net cash provided by operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Our presentation of capital expenditures (accrued) is a non-GAAP measure. Capital expenditures (accrued) is defined as cash additions to property, plant and equipment adjusted for the change in capital accrual and additions to other assets. Management believes this is useful to investors as an indicator of Marathon's commitment to capital expenditure discipline by eliminating differences caused by the timing of capital accrual and other items. Capital expenditures (accrued) should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, cash additions to property, plant and equipment as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.Our presentation of reinvestment rate is a non-GAAP measure. The reinvestment rate in the context of adjusted free cash flow is defined as capital expenditures (accrued) divided by adjusted CFO. The reinvestment rate in the context of free cash flow is defined as cash additions to property, plant and equipment divided by net cash provided by operating activities. Management believes the reinvestment rate is useful to investors to demonstrate the Company's commitment to generating cash for use towards investor-friendly purposes (which includes balance sheet enhancement, base dividend and other return of capital).These non-GAAP financial measures reflect an additional way of viewing aspects of the business that, when viewed with GAAP results may provide a more complete understanding of factors and trends affecting the business and are a useful tool to help management and investors make informed decisions about Marathon Oil's financial and operating performance. These measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our investor package on our website at https://ir.marathonoil.com/ and in the tables below.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Dividend Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks By Hedge Funds. High bond yields have been a positive addition to the portfolios of income investors after years of nominal fixed-income returns. However, dividend stocks still provide essential balance and additional income to an asset portfolio, and they help combat the high inflation effectively. Jenny Harrington, CEO of Gilman Hill Asset Management, told Barron’s on October 29:“You need capital appreciation of the share price and growth of the dividend in an inflationary environment.”Dividend stocks have comparatively outperformed in the market selloff this year. Dividend-paying entities in the S&amp;P 500 have dropped 11%, compared to the 19% decline in the S&amp;P 500 benchmark and the 23% drop in non-dividend stocks so far this year. Income stocks are attractive amid market volatility since they protect investors against plummeting share prices. Stephanie Link, the chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors, advised investors to focus on dividend growth prospects rather than high yields alone. She further said:“If companies are going to continue to increase their dividends, then I feel good about them.”Similarly, David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Advisors, noted that although Treasury yield has risen which means that bond payout is attractive at about 4%, dividend stocks provide the potential for increasing payouts while bond payments remain fixed. Some of the best entities for a dividend stock portfolio include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology We selected the following dividend stocks based on their popularity among elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022. We have also mentioned the latest analyst coverage, underlying business fundamentals, and recent dividend payouts by the companies for additional context for readers. The dividend yields are mentioned as of November 2. Story continuesDividend Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks By Hedge FundsPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashDividend Stock Portfolio: Top Stock Picks By Hedge Funds10. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Dividend Yield as of November 2: 1.08%S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is a New York-based provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, data analytics, and workflow solutions in the global capital and commodity markets. The company operates through six divisions – S&amp;P Global Ratings, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, S&amp;P Global Mobility, and S&amp;P Global Engineering Solutions. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) declared on September 28 a $0.85 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 12, to shareholders of record on November 18. As of October 27, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) has completed $11 billion of its $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program year-to-date, and it expects to launch the remaining $1 billion of the authorized repurchase units in December.Argus analyst John Eade on November 1 maintained a Buy recommendation on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) but lowered the price target on the shares to $365 from $420. The company has almost concluded a multi-year restructuring and is now focused on its rapidly growing financial businesses, including the lucrative and not very competitive business of rating bonds, the analyst told investors in a research note. The analyst also added that he believes S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) management can pull through the tough inflation and high interest rate environment.According to Insider Monkey’s database, 84 hedge funds were bullish on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) at the end of June 2022, compared to 97 funds in the prior quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 8.76 million shares worth nearly $3 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is one of the top picks of elite investors for a dividend stock portfolio. Here is what Baron Durable Advantage Fund has to say about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”9. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Dividend Yield as of November 2: 0.12%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the American multinational technology and semiconductor firm, is one of the most popular picks of hedge funds for a dividend stock portfolio. At the end of October, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock gained as investors turned their attention towards the semiconductor industry in the midst of the Intel and Mobileye spin-off. On October 24, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis maintained an Overweight rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but lowered the price target on the shares to $140 from $190. The analyst is ""actively looking for a bottom to get more positive"" on the semiconductor sector and sees it closer in some end markets than others, but still believes ""it is too early to pull the trigger across the board."" According to Insider Monkey’s data, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was part of 84 hedge fund portfolios at the end of June 2022, compared to 102 in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 7.6 million shares worth $1.15 billion.  Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below.During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”8. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Dividend Yield as of November 2: 1.20%UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) operates as a diversified health care company in the United States. The company specializes in health insurance, Medicaid plans, and healthcare programs. On October 14, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $5.79 and a revenue of $80.9 billion, outperforming market estimates by $0.35 and $360 million, respectively. There was a double digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare segments. The company raised its full-year 2022 net earnings outlook to $20.85 to $21.05 per share and adjusted net earnings to $21.85 to $22.05 per share, versus a consensus of $21.89 and prior view of $21.4 to $21.9. On October 18, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill raised the price target on UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) to $615 from $569 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The company reported robust Q3 results as membership growth remains resilient and value-based arrangements continue to expand, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 91 hedge funds were long UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) at the end of June 2022, compared to 103 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the largest position holder in the company, with 3.11 million shares worth $1.60 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Carillon Tower Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and United Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported solid quarterly results and raised 2022 guidance modestly. Additionally, managed care is another industry that is viewed as defensive in the current environment, which helped support UnitedHealth and its peer group.”7. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 93Dividend Yield as of November 2: 0.24%Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is a Massachusetts-based provider of life sciences solutions, analytical instruments, specialty diagnostics, and laboratory products and services worldwide. As per elite hedge funds, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is one of the premier picks for a dividend stock portfolio. On October 31, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) announced that it is acquiring the UK-based diagnostic products maker, The Binding Site, for $2.6 billion from private equity firm Nordic Capital in an all-cash transaction. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) also said that throughout Q4, it expects to execute a $1 billion share buyback program, bringing the total capital spent on buybacks in 2022 to $3 billion.Baird analyst Catherine Ramsey Schulte on November 1 reiterated an Outperform rating on Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) but lowered the price target on the shares to $665 from $695. The analyst noted that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)’s Specialty Diagnostics segment typically gets the least investor attention and interest, but she forecasts the deal to be accretive to both overall revenue growth and margins. She also updated her model to factor in the acquisition, Q4 and full-year buyback assumptions, and 2023 forex headwinds.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 93 hedge funds were bullish on Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) at the end of June 2022, compared to 101 funds in the prior quarter. Thomas Steyer’s Farallon Capital is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.2 million shares worth $675 million. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is the world’s largest life sciences tools company. Shares fell due to the rotation out of life sciences tools stocks, driven by concerns about a possible global recession, foreign currency exposure, COVID-related lockdowns in China, and reduced levels of biotechnology funding. We continue to believe Thermo Fisher has a strong long-term growth outlook given a large and growing addressable market coupled with its industry-leading scale, commercial infrastructure, e-commerce platform, supply-chain capabilities, and R&amp;D investment.”6. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Dividend Yield as of November 2: 2.42%Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is an American multinational company that provides banking and financial products and services. The bank operates through Consumer Banking, Global Wealth &amp; Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets segments. On October 17, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) reported earnings for the third quarter of 2022, announcing earnings per share of $0.81 and a revenue of $24.50 billion, topping market estimates by $0.04 and $1.05 billion, respectively. On October 19, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 30, to shareholders of record on December 2. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) delivers a dividend yield of 2.42% as of November 2. BMO Capital analyst James Fotheringham raised the price target on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) on October 18 to $42 from $41 but kept a Market Perform rating on the shares. The analyst cited Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)’s ""impressive"" Q3 top-line beat and ""meaningful"" operating leverage as its pre-provision net revenue grew 24% compared to Q2 2022. However, the analyst added that it remains too early to purchase bank stocks, and he believes that Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stock will struggle until the economic backdrop stabilizes.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 99 funds were bullish on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) at the end of Q2 2022, with collective stakes worth $36 billion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with more than 1 billion shares worth $31.4 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is one of the premier stocks to consider for a robust dividend stock portfolio. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We made only one new purchase during the quarter, initiating a position in Bank of America (BAC). As one of America’s largest banks, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is second only to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in size and is probably its closest peer. Both are well-run banks, but compared to JPM, since the GFC, BAC has retired more shares, grown EPS faster and currently has more capital and a lower dividend payout. We are attracted to BAC’s strong capital base, high capital generation capacity, large loan loss reserve, low (~50%) loan/deposit ratio, short duration investment securities book, and low dividend payout that provides financial flexibility. BAC has a less volatile earnings stream than JPM with lower capital market sensitive exposures. Additionally, BAC is rigorously stress tested by the Fed every year in quantitative and qualitative fashion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which we hold in the portfolio, owns 12% of BAC. He petitioned the Fed to own more than 10%, so he clearly likes it. Bank stocks were strong gainers in 2021 on the prospects of higher rates boosting net interest margins, but the stocks pulled back in the first half of 2022 on economic concerns. We believe BAC has massive scale advantages, should benefit from increasing interest rates, particularly in the 2-year part of the yield curve, and should grow over time with the economy. The economic environment is highly uncertain, but current consensus includes the provision for losses more than doubling and capital markets activity slowing. Against that backdrop, our purchase price equated to about 8.5X our estimates of “mid-cycle” earnings. With leading businesses, a double-digit ROE, a prudent capital return strategy and a strong balance sheet, we believe this entry point offers a solid long-term value.” Click to continue reading and see Dividend Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks By Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Infrastructure Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Bank Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

You can access the full report that contains detailed historical actual and estimates for the current and following periods, please click here&gt;&gt;&gt;Here are the key points:·        The picture emerging from the 2022 Q3 earnings season continues to run counter to pre-season fears of an impending earnings cliff. Overall corporate profitability isn't great, but it isn't bad either. That said, estimates for the coming periods are  steadily coming down, with the revisions trend accelerating in recent days.·        Looking at 2022 Q3 as a whole, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are currently expected to be up +2.0% from the same period last year on +10.7% higher revenues. Excluding contributions from the Energy sector, Q3 earnings for the rest of the index would be -5.6% below the year-earlier level.·        Looking at the calendar-year picture, total S&amp;P 500 earnings are expected to be up +5.7% in 2022 and +3.8% in 2023. On an ex-Energy basis, total 2022 index earnings would be down -1.2% (instead of +5.7%, with Energy).·        The widely held view that earnings estimates remain out of sync with the economic ground reality is erroneous as it looks at the aggregate picture at the index level where estimates for the Energy sector have consistently been positive.The focus lately has been on the disappointing results from the Tech sector, particularly the mega-cap operators Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Apple AAPL; we have been referring to this group as the 'Big 5 Tech Players'.Story continuesOf this group, Apple has fared a lot better, burnishing its leadership credentials and its 'Rock of Gibraltar' status in the eyes of its legion of supporters. That said, these results have forced us all to revisit our long-held assumptions about the sustainability of these technology leaders' earnings power.The market's immediate concerns appear to be centered on the outlook for Amazon and Meta, as Alphabet and Microsoft results weren't really that bad. Some of that differentiation was clear from the stock market reaction to the results as well, with Amazon and Meta shares really getting punished following their quarterly reports.The one thing that is becoming clear after results from these 'Big 5 Tech Players' is that none of these players' profitability is Teflon coated and immune from cyclical forces. Apple may be looking invincible in the afterglow of its quarterly report, but the consumer decision to purchase the company's pricey phones and other devices remains a discretionary choice and vulnerable to economic forces.Q3 earnings for the 'Big 5 Tech Players' in the aggregate are down -15.2% from the same period last year on +9.4% higher revenues.For 2022 as a whole, the group is expected to bring in -13.6% lower earnings on +5.5% higher revenues. But growth is expected to resume next year and accelerate the following year.A big driver of the group's current growth challenge is the all-around margin pressures, a function of their bulging payrolls, particularly for Amazon, Meta and Alphabet. Many in the market have been suspecting for some time now that these companies are significantly over-staffed, with Amazon even acknowledging the reality. One could say that if they move into the management mode of other blue chip operators by getting on top of their expenses, they can help strengthen their profitability.Amazon hired a ton of workers during Covid to meet the surging demand as all of us stopped going to stores. The question now is whether they need to let some of those workers go as Covid restrictions are mostly in the rear-view mirror.In addition to the group's margin challenge, there are two other factors that will drive their profitability over the next two years.The first factor is the unusual impact of Covid on their profitability in the last two years, including an unusually large gain in 2021 on account of the pandemic. The question now is whether the +58% jump in 2021 earnings brought forward profits from 2022 only or 2022 and 2023?The second factor is related to the impact of macroeconomic forces on these companies' profitability. Microsoft's business was affected not only by the slump in PC demand, a function of post-Covid adjustment, but also by growth deceleration in the cloud business.We saw similar cloud-centric challenges in the Amazon and Alphabet reports as well. This cloud deceleration is likely a reflection of companies cutting back on enterprise spending, on top of reining in digital advertising spending.The market was under the impression that cloud spending was effectively immune from economic forces and will not experience any cuts. The numbers from Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet and others show otherwise.This brings us back to evaluating the seemingly Teflon-coated status of Apple's gadgets and services.I am of the opinion that once the Fed's tighter policy regime produces cracks in the labor market, we will end up discovering that consumers rationally deferred replacing their older devices with newer ones. We are not there yet because the labor market is still rock solid, but we could very well reach that stage at either of the coming two quarterly reports.The Estimate Revisions TrendAnalysts have been steadily cutting their estimates for some time now. We saw this in the run up to the start of the Q3 earnings season and the trend continues with respect to estimates for the current period (2022 Q4) and full-year 2023.Aggregate S&amp;P 500 earnings outside of the Energy sector peaked in mid-April and have been steadily trending down ever since. In fact, S&amp;P 500 earnings estimates in the aggregate outside of the Energy sector have declined -9.9% since mid-April, with double-digit percentage declines in Retail, Construction, Consumer Discretionary, Tech, Industrial Products and the Aerospace sectors. On the whole, estimates are down for 13 of the 16 Zacks sectors.The Overall Earnings PicturePlease note that a big part of this year's growth is thanks to the strong momentum in the Energy sector whose earnings are on track to grow +142.6%. Excluding this extraordinary Energy sector contribution, earnings growth for the rest of the index would be down -1.3%. This relatively flat earnings picture for this year is also in-line with the economic ground reality.Earnings next year are expected to be up only +3.8% as a whole and +5.6% excluding the Energy sector. This magnitude of growth can hardly be called out-of-sync with a flat or even modestly down economic growth outlook. Don't forget that headline GDP growth numbers are in real or inflation-adjusted terms while S&amp;P 500 earnings discussed here are not.As mentioned earlier, 2023 aggregate earnings estimates on an ex-Energy basis are already down -9.9% since mid-April. Perhaps we see a bit more downward adjustments to estimates over the coming weeks, after we have seen Q3 results. But we have nevertheless already covered some ground in taking estimates to a fair or appropriate level.This is particularly so if whatever economic downturn lies ahead proves to be more of the garden variety rather than the last two such events. Recency bias forces us to use the last two economic downturns, which were also among the nastiest in recent history, as our reference points. But we need to be cautious against that natural tendency as the economy's foundations at present remain unusually strong.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?

99,e97592d3-029b-3d3a-9c43-bde901c9e0c1,PAYX,2022-11-03,"Four Days Left To Buy Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) Before The Ex-Dividend Date",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/four-days-left-buy-paychex-131710272.html,1667481430,STORY,['PAYX'],"[Paychex, Inc. (NASDAQ:PAYX) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in 4 days. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. It is important to be aware of the ex-dividend date because any trade on the stock needs to have been settled on or before the record date. Accordingly, Paychex investors that purchase the stock on or after the 8th of November will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 23rd of November.The company's next dividend payment will be US$0.79 per share, on the back of last year when the company paid a total of US$3.16 to shareholders. Last year's total dividend payments show that Paychex has a trailing yield of 2.8% on the current share price of $114.5. We love seeing companies pay a dividend, but it's also important to be sure that laying the golden eggs isn't going to kill our golden goose! So we need to investigate whether Paychex can afford its dividend, and if the dividend could grow. See our latest analysis for Paychex Dividends are typically paid out of company income, so if a company pays out more than it earned, its dividend is usually at a higher risk of being cut. Paychex paid out more than half (73%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies. Yet cash flow is typically more important than profit for assessing dividend sustainability, so we should always check if the company generated enough cash to afford its dividend. It paid out 77% of its free cash flow as dividends, which is within usual limits but will limit the company's ability to lift the dividend if there's no growth.It's positive to see that Paychex's dividend is covered by both profits and cash flow, since this is generally a sign that the dividend is sustainable, and a lower payout ratio usually suggests a greater margin of safety before the dividend gets cut.Click here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.Story continueshistoric-dividendHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?Businesses with strong growth prospects usually make the best dividend payers, because it's easier to grow dividends when earnings per share are improving. If earnings fall far enough, the company could be forced to cut its dividend. For this reason, we're glad to see Paychex's earnings per share have risen 12% per annum over the last five years. The company paid out most of its earnings as dividends over the last year, even though business is booming and earnings per share are growing rapidly. Higher earnings generally bode well for growing dividends, although with seemingly strong growth prospects we'd wonder why management are not reinvesting more in the business.Another key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. Paychex has delivered 9.5% dividend growth per year on average over the past 10 years. We're glad to see dividends rising alongside earnings over a number of years, which may be a sign the company intends to share the growth with shareholders.Final TakeawayIs Paychex worth buying for its dividend? It's good to see earnings are growing, since all of the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run. That's why we're glad to see Paychex's earnings per share growing, although as we saw, the company is paying out more than half of its earnings and cashflow - 73% and 77% respectively. In summary, while it has some positive characteristics, we're not inclined to race out and buy Paychex today.In light of that, while Paychex has an appealing dividend, it's worth knowing the risks involved with this stock. For example - Paychex has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.If you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.Have feedback on this article?

In fact, 63% of respondents said they would be more likely to stay at their organization if they were provided with better learning opportunities.The report further revealed that employers are providing the right learning and development opportunities for full-time, in-office employees, but have gaps to fill when it comes to remote, hybrid, and part-time workers.""The American work experience is more varied than ever before - even between workers in the same roles,"" said Alison Stevens, director of HR Services at Paychex. ""We're seeing skill gaps grow as employees increasingly get to choose working arrangements that fit their lifestyles. With employees yearning for more educational and career-building experiences, employers will need to pay attention to the differences between these groups to curate programs that keep employees engaged and stimulated regardless of their time in an office.""Employees are more likely to stay with employers who offer robust educational and career-building opportunitiesMost employees (64%) strongly agree/agree that they are satisfied with their organization's opportunities for career advancement, though those who work fully remote are more likely to disagree (14%) than those who are fully on-site (8%) or hybrid (7%). Those who work full-time (69%) are more likely to be satisfied than those who work part-time (58%).Story continuesStill, most employees (63%) say they would be more likely to stay at their organization if they were provided with better career advancement opportunities. Millennials are most likely to hold this view, with 74% saying they'd be more likely to stay at their organization with more opportunities to learn and grow, compared to 63% of Gen X, 62% of Gen Z, and 45% of Baby Boomers. Those who are more likely to agree with the above sentiment also vary somewhat by industry:Construction (76%)Education and health services (60%)Retail, trade, transportation, and utilities (59%)Leisure and hospitality (42%)Note: For purposes of this study, Gen Z is defined as those born between 1997 and 2015, Millennials are defined as those born between 1981 and 1996, Gen X is defined as those born between 1965 and 1980, and Boomers are defined as those born between 1946 and 1964.Employees report specific soft and hard skills are holding them back in their careersThe top soft skills (abilities focused on personal development or interpersonal relations) and hard skills (abilities directly related to one's role) employees believe are holding them back from career advancement are:Soft SkillsHard SkillsTime management - 43%Data analytical skills - 39%Digital literacy - 39%Computer skills - 39%Leadership skills - 37%Software skills - 37%Soft skill differences by generation and between on-site, hybrid, and remote employeesFully on-site, hybrid and remote employees: Those whose work environment is fully on-site (46%) are more likely to say that digital literacy (the ability to use and understand technology) is holding them back than those whose work environment is fully remote (34%) or hybrid (26%). For fully remote employees (34%), communications skills were of bigger concern than for their on-site or hybrid counterparts (28% for both groups).Generational differences: For Baby Boomers, digital literacy is the top soft skill of concern (63%) compared to Gen Z, whose main concern is decision-making (45%).Hard skill differences by generation and between on-site, hybrid, and remote employeesFully on-site, hybrid and remote employees: Fully on-site employees (42%) are more likely to say that data analytical skills are holding them back, than hybrid (38%) and fully remote (35%) workers. Fully remote employees (30%) are more likely to say writing skills are holding them back than hybrid (25%) and fully on-site employees (22%).Generational differences: Baby Boomers were 51% more likely to say that computer skills were holding them back, and software skills were of bigger concern for Baby Boomers (43%) and Gen X (42%) than the younger generations, with 36% of Gen-Z and 31% of Millennials. Additionally, the likelihood of marketing skills holding employees back increased as employees got younger: 45% of Gen Z, 39% of Millennials, 31% of Gen X, and 27% of Baby Boomers.""Unemployment is at a 20-year low, and employees are begging for educational offerings that can help them learn and advance,"" said Jeanne Meister, founder of Future Workplace and executive vice president at Executive Networks. ""Employers have taken note, but there is always more they can be doing to encourage retention. For those employers who are unsure what their employees want, the best place to start is to ask. In this competitive hiring market, if you don't offer employees the resources they need to grow, someone else will.""For more insights from this survey, please view the full research report.About the ResearchThese findings are based on a survey conducted across the USA from August 22 to 28, 2022.

Adjusted total segment operating margin was a first quarter record, increasing 70 basis points compared with the prior year period. Our adjusted EBITDA margin increased 120 basis points year-over-year, and we achieved a first quarter record for adjusted earnings per share. These results reflect the agility of our team members and the continued actions we have taken to strengthen our business under The Win Strategy™.""Story continuesSegment ResultsDiversified Industrial Segment: North American first quarter sales increased 19% to $2.13 billion and operating income was $453.0 million compared with $333.7 million in the same period a year ago.

During the integration of recently acquired businesses, the company has seen diversity in practice of the classifications of certain expenses, and the reclassification was made to better align the presentation of expenses on the Consolidated Statement of Income with management’s internal reporting. The expenses reclassified from cost of sales to SG&amp;A relate to certain administrative activities conducted in production facilities and research and development. Foreign currency transaction expense was also reclassified from cost of sales to other (income) expense, net on the Consolidated Statement of Income. These reclassifications had no impact on net income, earnings per share, cash flows, segment reporting or the financial position of the Company and were retrospectively applied to all periods presented in the financial tables of this press release.Note on OrdersOrders provide near-term perspective on the company's outlook, particularly when viewed in the context of prior and future quarterly order rates. However, orders are not in themselves an indication of future performance. All comparisons are at constant currency exchange rates, with the prior year restated to the current-year rates. All exclude acquisitions until they can be reflected in both the numerator and denominator, and divestitures. Aerospace comparisons are rolling 12-month average computations. The total Parker orders number is derived from a weighted average of the year-over-year quarterly % change in orders for Diversified Industrial North America and Diversified Industrial International, and the year-over-year 12-month rolling average of orders for the Aerospace Systems Segment.Note on Net IncomeNet income referenced in this press release is equal to net income attributable to common shareholders.Note on Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresThis press release contains references to non-GAAP financial information including (a) adjusted net income; (b) adjusted earnings per share; (c) adjusted segment operating margins; (d) adjusted segment operating income; (e) EBITDA margin; (f) adjusted EBITDA margin and (g) organic sales growth. The adjusted net income, earnings per share, segment operating margin, adjusted segment operating income and organic sales measures are presented to allow investors and the company to meaningfully evaluate changes in net income, earnings per share and segment operating margins on a comparable basis from period to period. This press release also contains references to EBITDA, EBITDA margin and adjusted EBITDA margin. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Although EBITDA, EBITDA margin and adjusted EBITDA margin are not measures of performance calculated in accordance with GAAP, we believe that they are useful to an investor in evaluating the results of this quarter versus the prior period. Comparable descriptions of record adjusted results in this release refer only to the period from the first quarter of FY2011 to the periods presented in this release. This period coincides with recast historical financial results provided in association with our FY2014 change in segment reporting. A reconciliation of non-GAAP measures is included in the financial tables of this press release.Forward-Looking StatementsForward-Looking Statements Forward-looking statements contained in this and other written and oral reports are made based on known events and circumstances at the time of release, and as such, are subject in the future to unforeseen uncertainties and risks.

With Ukraine and Russia accounting for 30% of the world's wheat exports and 15% of the world's vegetable oil, ADM has benefited from the tighter supplies even though its own input costs, such as that for corn, are higher as well.Continue reading]"

(NASDAQ:SNPS)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-synopsys-inc-153254351.html,1667403174,STORY,['SNPS'],"[Does the November share price for Synopsys, Inc. (NASDAQ:SNPS) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by taking the forecast future cash flows of the company and discounting them back to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. See our latest analysis for Synopsys The ModelWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$1.65bUS$1.79bUS$2.17bUS$2.34bUS$2.47bUS$2.57bUS$2.67bUS$2.75bUS$2.83bUS$2.91bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x9Analyst x7Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 5.49%Est @ 4.44%Est @ 3.7%Est @ 3.18%Est @ 2.82%Est @ 2.57% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2% US$1.5kUS$1.6kUS$1.8kUS$1.8kUS$1.7kUS$1.7kUS$1.6kUS$1.6kUS$1.5kUS$1.4k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$16bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$2.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.0%) = US$57bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$57b÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$28bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$45b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$291, the company appears about fair value at a 0.07% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Synopsys as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.018. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Rather it should be seen as a guide to ""what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?"" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Synopsys, there are three pertinent items you should explore:Risks: You should be aware of the 1 warning sign for Synopsys we've uncovered before considering an investment in the company.Management:Have insiders been ramping up their shares to take advantage of the market's sentiment for SNPS's future outlook?

The acquisition price represents a 13.6x EBITDA multiple or a cap rate of approximately 6.6% on the Resort’s 2022 estimated results.The Resort is expected to be one of Host’s top three assets based on estimated full year 2022 results, with RevPAR of $855, TRevPAR of $1,430, and EBITDA per key2 of $185,000, further improving the quality of the Company’s portfolio.The Resort is one of only a handful of luxury ski in / ski out resorts in the United States. It sits on 6.3 acres in Teton Village, just steps from the gondola at the base of the Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, one of the top-rated ski destinations in the country. The Resort is near downtown Jackson, in close proximity to Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks, a unique feature, making it a year-round destination where future supply is expected to be severely restricted.   The Resort, which opened in 2003, underwent a comprehensive guestroom renovation in 2022 and no disruptive capital expenditures are expected in the near term. In addition, the Jackson Hole Airport is undergoing a $65 million renovation and expansion, which is scheduled to complete in 2022, to better accommodate year-round demand, shrinking shoulder seasons, and increasing visitor growth. The Resort has 125 oversized rooms and suites that average approximately 650 square feet with gas fireplaces, balconies, and dramatic views of the surrounding mountains and valleys. It includes a 5-bedroom, 4,700 square foot penthouse, and offers nearly 9,000 square feet of indoor meeting space, three upscale food and beverage outlets plus a pool café, two retail outlets and a 16-treatment room alpine spa. In addition, the Resort offers an on-site ski concierge, a private ski club, a kids club, and a fitness center. It also features an additional 44 private residences, which are not owned by Host, ranging in size from 1,700 to 3,700 square feet. Of the 44 residences, 30 currently participate in a rental program through the resort.Story continuesJames F. Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “We are thrilled to add the Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole to our portfolio. It is an iconic, irreplaceable asset in a new market for Host, and one of only a handful of luxury ski resorts in the country. From 2014 through 2019 the Resort had a RevPAR CAGR of 5.8%, significantly outperforming the broader ultra-luxury set, which had a RevPAR CAGR of 4.3% over the same time period. With year-round demand generators, no new supply on the horizon and a recent comprehensive guestroom renovation, we believe the Resort is well positioned to continue outperforming over the long term, driving value for our portfolio and our shareholders.”Host noted it believes the Resort’s 2022 performance is muted, as a result of the guest room renovation during the first half of the year, as well as Jackson Hole Airport being closed for approximately three months during the year. By growing year-round occupancy to historical levels and repositioning the food and beverage outlets and public spaces, the Company expects the Resort to stabilize at approximately 11-13x EBITDA3 in the 2026-2028 timeframe.About Host Hotels &amp; Resorts Host Hotels &amp; Resorts, Inc. is an S&amp;P 500 company and is the largest lodging real estate investment trust and one of the largest owners of luxury and upper-upscale hotels.

Risoleo, President and Chief Executive Officer, said, “During the third quarter, we continued to see strong positive operating trends. RevPAR was $192 for the quarter, representing a 1.4% increase over the third quarter of 2019, the second consecutive quarter of improvement in comparison to 2019. Our results this quarter were driven by continued rate strength, with an increase of 15.8% compared to the same period in 2019, despite typical seasonality and shifting business and market mix.”Risoleo continued, “In November, we completed another acquisition, buying the Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole for $315 million. We are pleased to further diversify our portfolio with one of only a handful of ski-in/ski-out luxury resorts in the United States. The hotel is situated in close proximity to Yellowstone and Grand Teton National Parks in a year-round market with shrinking shoulder seasons, severely restricted supply and a history of strong RevPAR growth. This acquisition further demonstrates Host’s ability to utilize our strong balance sheet to improve the quality and EBITDA growth profile of our portfolio. As a result, we believe that Host is well-positioned for future growth.”Highlights:All Owned Hotel Total RevPAR was $306.11 and All Owned Hotel RevPAR was $192.06 in the third quarter, a 3.8% and 1.4% increase, respectively, over third quarter of 2019. Average room rates were 15.8% above third quarter 2019, driven by continued strong leisure demand, while also benefiting from growth in urban markets, driven by increased group and business travel.Generated GAAP net income of $116 million in the third quarter and GAAP operating profit margin for the quarter was 12.4%, an improvement of 150 basis points compared to the third quarter of 2019.Achieved All Owned Hotel EBITDA of $341 million and Adjusted EBITDAre of $328 million, both of which exceeded 2019 third quarter results.The strong improvement in rate and more normalized staffing levels led to All Owned Hotel EBITDA margin of 28.7% for the third quarter, exceeding the third quarter 2019 margin by 250 basis points. GAAP operating profit margin and All Owned Hotel EBITDA margin benefited from receipt of business interruption insurance proceeds of $10 million related to the Orlando World Center Marriott, which, net of management fees, increased margins by 60 basis points.During the third quarter, sold the Chicago Marriott Suites Downers Grove for $16 million, including $2 million of furniture fixtures &amp; equipment (""FF&amp;E"") funds retained by the Company. The hotel was expected to have capital expenditures needs of approximately $15 million within the next five years.Subsequent to quarter end, acquired the 125-room Four Seasons Resort and Residences Jackson Hole for $315 million.

During the third quarter, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in the Company’s share repurchase program to $1 billion. No shares were repurchased during the third quarter under the program.Operating ResultsAll Owned Hotel RevPAR surpassed third quarter 2019 RevPAR, as strong leisure demand for resorts and hotels located in the Company’s Sunbelt markets and Hawaii continued. Results also benefited from group revenues surpassing third quarter 2019, as group demand improved quarter over quarter and rates exceeded 2019.Food and beverage revenues for the Company's current portfolio exceeded 2019 for the first time since the onset of the pandemic, improving approximately 3.8%, compared to the third quarter of 2019. Banquet and Catering revenues improved 6% compared to 2019 driven by higher contributions from group business, and outlet revenues also exceeded 2019.Hiring pace improved in the third quarter compared to the second quarter, leading to staffing more aligned with operators' desired levels.While the majority of the Company’s properties in Florida were affected by Hurricane Ian in September, the most significant damage sustained during the storm occurred at The Ritz-Carlton, Naples and Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa. Due to evacuation mandates and/or loss of commercial power, five of the Company’s properties in Florida were temporarily closed, three of which reopened within days. Due to proximity of the event to quarter end, operating results for the third quarter 2022 were not materially impacted, however the impact will carry into the fourth quarter as well as into 2023, as The Ritz-Carlton, Naples and Hyatt Regency Coconut Point Resort and Spa remain closed. The Company is still evaluating the complete property and business interruption impacts of the storm. Despite a brief loss of commercial power and damage to the property’s grounds, pools and amenities, the Hyatt Regency Coconut Point has remained open to first responders and the hotel is expected to reopen to guests in mid-November, as a phased reopening, with the waterpark reopening during the second quarter of 2023. The Ritz-Carlton, Naples is expected to remain closed for the remainder of the year and into 2023, with a phased reopening strategy being evaluated.Hotel Business Mix Update The Company’s customers fall into three broad groups: transient, group and contract business, which accounted for approximately 61%, 35%, and 4%, respectively, of its 2019 room sales.While leisure demand continued to contribute to improvements in the third quarter compared to 2019, group demand also moved closer to 2019 levels, while maintaining a strong increase in rate compared to the third quarter of 2019. The following are the sequential results for transient, group and contract business in comparison to 2019 performance, for the Company's current portfolio:  Quarter ended September 30, 2022  Quarter ended June 30, 2022   Transient  Group  Contract  Transient  Group  Contract Room nights (in thousands)  1,557   991   151   1,581   1,116   138 Percentage change in room nights  vs. same period in 2019  (18.4)%  (2.6)%  21.2%  (10.3)%  (8.4)%  12.4%Rooms Revenues (in millions) $487  $229  $28  $529  $289  $26 Percentage change in revenues vs.  same period in 2019  1.7%  3.3%  9.4%  9.7%  (2.9)%  2.1%Capital Expenditures The following presents the Company’s capital expenditures spend for the third quarter and the forecast for full year 2022 (in millions):  Year-to-date ended September 30, 2022  2022 Full Year Forecast             Actual  Low-end of range  High-end of range ROI - Marriott Transformational Capital Program $70  $90  $115 ROI - All other ROI projects  170   230   240 Total ROI project spend  240   320   355 Renewals and Replacements  117   180   220 Total Capital Expenditures $357  $500  $575 The Company invested heavily in capital expenditures in the early phases of recovery in order to minimize future disruption and believes these renovations will position these hotels to capture additional revenue during the lodging recovery.

Not so fast. For now, it’s still best to keep taking a defensive approach, and sticking with the best bear market stocks.Sure, a positive GDP number, after two quarters of GDP declines, may suggest that a much-feared 2023 recession is no longer on the table. However, much of this increase can be chalked up to a narrowing trade deficit, which economists have stated is a one-off occurrence.Over the next few quarters, the Federal Reserve’s interest rate hikes (which are likely to continue) will really start to have an impact on economic activity. This could mean more volatility, and possibly further broad market declines.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsA continued downturn will hammer more cyclical and/or speculative names lower, but the best bear market stocks will likely stay resilient. That stands to be the case here with these seven high-quality defensive names. Each one offers the opportunity for further resiliency, plus the potential for steady returns via dividends.BTIBritish American Tobacco$39.53CVSCVS Health$93.68DGDollar General$93.28JNJJohnson &amp; Johnson$174.57PMPhilip Morris International$92.52OXYOccidental Petroleum$71.11WTRGEssential Utilities$43.83British American Tobacco (BTI)British American Tobacco logo on a buildingSource: DutchMen / Shutterstock.comHeld down by their “sin stock” reputation and uncertain future prospects, tobacco stocks like British American Tobacco (NYSE:BTI) delivered middling returns during the bull market.However, the flip side to this is BTI stock has stayed resilient throughout the 2022 stock market downturn. Shares are up slightly this year. Including dividends from this high-yielder, the stock has delivered a total return of around 9.17%.Better yet, there may be more room for BTI to deliver solid returns through dividends (7.52% forward yield) and slight appreciation.Story continuesOver the past five years, BTI’s dividend has grown by an average of 4.5% per year. Assuming shares could continue to grow in tandem with an increased dividend, it’s not out of the question for British American Tobacco to keep delivering double-digit annualized returns.CVS Health (CVS)Source: Susan Montgomery / Shutterstock.comCVS Health (NYSE:CVS) hasn’t been as resilient as most of the defensive stocks discussed above and below. While experiencing lesser declines than stocks overall, shares are down 11% year-to-date.So then, why consider CVS stock one of the best bear market stocks? Mostly, because this health services conglomerate is in an industry that will hold up well during an economic downturn. Beyond just its namesake pharmacy chain, the company also owns health insurer Aetna.Yes, as InvestorPlace’s Chris Lau discussed recently, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (or CMS) has downgraded one of Aetna’s Medicare Advantage Health Plans.This will have a negative impact on revenue in 2024. Yet for 2023, sell side analysts anticipate positive earnings growth (around 6%). Trading for only 10.2x next year’s estimated earnings, CVS may be oversold. The stock also offers investors a forward yield of 2.38%.Dollar General (DG)Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, middaySource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comDollar General (NYSE:DG) needs little introduction when talking about its bear market bona fides.Shares in the discount retailer are up 7.6% YTD, as high inflation and the economic slowdown continue to drive more traffic into the company’s stores.This strong performance during tough economic times has of course become reflected in the valuation of DG stock. Based on analyst earnings estimates for the current fiscal year ($11.57 per share), DG right now trades at a price-to-earnings (or P/E) ratio of 22.1.But while this may make DG seem pricey, relative to expected future earnings growth, this valuation may be reasonable. Forecasts call for 9.7% earnings growth next fiscal year.If the stock can maintain its current multiple, as well as continue to increase its dividend (forward yield of 0.88%), Dollar General could continue to deliver strong returns for investors from here.Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ)A red Johnson &amp; Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.Source: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.comA “dividend king,” with more than 50 years of consecutive dividend growth, Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) has long been a great stock to buy and hold in all markets. During this bear market, this blue-chip healthcare stock has stayed in the green.YTD, JNJ stock has produced a total return of 2.38%. While not setting the world on fire, that’s far better than  how major indices have fared. If the bear market persists, JNJ could stay steady, providing a safe harbor in case of additional volatility. Shares could even rise slightly from here, in line with mid single-digit dividend growth.If the market makes a comeback, from say, a Fed Pivot? Johnson &amp; Johnson could experience a decent rise in price. In the event the Federal Reserve starts cutting interest rates in 2023, JNJ (now at 17.2 times earnings) may move back to a higher valuation (20-25 times earnings).Philip Morris International (PM)Philip Morris factory offices in Lithuania. PM stock.Source: Vytautas Kielaitis / ShutterstockPhilip Morris International (NYSE:PM) is another great bear market choice among tobacco stocks.PMI, which owns the rights to popular cigarette brands like Marlboro outside the United States, may sport a lower dividend yield (5.67%) than its former corporate parent, Altria Group (NYSE:MO), which has an 8.28% forward yield.However, there’s a key factor that may more than account for this. That would be PMI’s stronger growth prospects. Philip Morris International has had considerably greater success rolling out non-cigarette tobacco and non-tobacco nicotine products.If the company’s raised bid for Swedish Match (OTCMKTS:SWMAF) prevails, it could further cement its reputation as the leading name in “post-smoking” tobacco/nicotine products.In turn, this points to a stronger chance of continued long-term earnings growth. This will likely enable PM stock to sustain and grow its valuation, as well as continue to steadily increase its dividend.Occidental Petroleum (OXY)A magnifying glass zooms in on the Occidental Petroleum website.Source: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.comOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) shares have continued to crush it during this bear market. That’s not surprising, given the fact oil and gas prices spiked earlier this year.Yet while oil has slid from its 2022 high ($126.42 per barrel) on economic downturn fears, factors like production cuts point to prices staying high.Obviously, this is good news for OXY stock investors. The oil and gas exploration company’s earnings will stay high. OXY will likely hold onto its recent gains as well. As Louis Navellier recently argued, shares could add to their triple-digit 2022 gains, thanks to two catalysts.First, in the near-term, if Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A,NYSE:BRK.B) continues to increase its OXY stake, shares could trend higher. Second, over a longer time horizon, Occidental Petroleum’s move into more “green” endeavors, such as carbon capture, stands to also move the needle.Essential Utilities (WTRG)Utilities stocks: a stock image of light fixtures; one lightbulb is lit upSource: ShutterstockFormerly known as Aqua America, Essential Utilities (NYSE:WTRG) took on its current name in 2020. This name change better reflects the diversified nature of this utility giant.Besides providing residential and commercial water services under the Aqua brand, the company also owns natural gas utility Peoples Gas.WTRG stock has been hammered lower this year on valuation concerns. Yet following the correction in its valuation, it’s now a much better stock to buy and hold during this bear market.Given the resilient nature of its business, and its reputation as a dividend growth stock, WTRG stands to maintain its current valuation (around 24.5 times earnings).Speaking of dividend growth, Essential Utilities has increased its payout 16 years in a row. Over the past five years, its dividend (forward yield of 2.64%) has gone up by an average of 6.99% per year.At the date of publication, Thomas Niel held a LONG position in MO stock. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Thomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.More From InvestorPlaceBuy This $5 Stock BEFORE This Apple Project Goes LiveThe Best $1 Investment You Can Make TodayEarly Bitcoin Millionaire Reveals His Next Big Crypto Trade “On Air”It doesn’t matter if you have $500 or $5 million.

131,2d9c89f7-cf77-36f8-9380-310496e4a41b,SPG,2022-11-03,3 REITs Trading Way Below Market Value,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-reits-trading-way-below-152437235.html,1667402677,STORY,"['SPG', 'BDN', 'SLG-PI']","[The No. 1 adage of investing is, “Buy low, sell high.”When investors examine real estate investment trust (REIT) stocks, they look for those that are trading well below their true market value, with the idea they may revert to the real value in the future. But how do you know whether a REIT is undervalued?REITs can be evaluated in two ways. First, if the current dividend yield is higher than its long-term average, the REIT is said to be undervalued. If the yield is less than its long-term average, the REIT is overvalued.Second, we look at funds from operations (FFO) in relation to the stock price. The formula P/FFO means to divide the stock price (P) by the FFO. This is similar to P/E ratios in non-REIT stocks. If the P/FFO is substantially lower than its same-sector peers (healthcare, retail, industrial, etc.), then the REIT is said to be undervalued.Given the criteria above, here are three REITs that appear to be currently undervalued.REIT NAMEP/FFOP/FFO SECTOR AVGRECENT DIVIDEND YIELD5-YR DIVIDEND YIELDSIMON PROPERTY GROUP INC.9.2113.466.42%5.84%SL GREEN REALTY CORP.5.8513.969.47%4.84%BRANDYWINE REALTY TRUST4.6913.9611.4%5.70%Simon Property Group Inc. (NYSE: SPG) is an Indianapolis-based retail REIT that owns and leases shopping malls, restaurants, outlet centers and entertainment venues. A member of the S&amp;P 100, Simon Property Group is one of the largest shopping mall REITs in the U.S. and also owns properties in Europe and Asia.October was an extremely difficult month for most REIT stocks, and Simon Property Group’s stock fell to a mid-month low of $86.02 but has since rebounded to $109. Its $7 annual dividend is now yielding 6.4%.One thing to admire about Simon Property Group is its resiliency. In 2020, when COVID-19 triggered a huge price decline, the stock traded below $37. But within 2½ years it had risen to $160. Could history repeat?SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) is the largest owner and landlord of New York City offices, with 62 buildings totaling 33.6 million square feet.Story continuesInflation and recession fears have driven SL Green’s price back down to a recent 52-week low of $35.49. Still, the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10 is reasonable and third-quarter funds from operation (FFO) of $1.66 will easily cover three monthly dividend payments of $93.25. The $3.73 annual dividend now yields 9.4% and is 91% higher than its five-year average yield.History has shown that inflation and recessions come and go, so SL Green at its recent price near $40 could prove to be a bargain going forward.Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE: BDN) is a Philadelphia-based commercial REIT that owns, develops, leases and manages 175 properties located from its home city to Austin, Texas.Brandywine Realty Trust’s 52-week range is $5.95 to $14.88, but like so many other REITs, its stock price has been decimated by higher interest rates this year.Brandywine’s quarterly dividend of $0.19 has been a stable but slow grower over the past five years and presently yields over 11% annually.Third-quarter 2022 FFO of $0.36 was a penny better than the third quarter of 2021, so covering the dividend payment is no problem. The stock is up about 10% since hitting the lows a few weeks ago.

(NYSE:SPG) shareholders should be happy to see the share price up 27% in the last month. But that doesn't change the fact that the returns over the last five years have been less than pleasing. You would have done a lot better buying an index fund, since the stock has dropped 28% in that half decade.While the last five years has been tough for Simon Property Group shareholders, this past week has shown signs of promise. So let's look at the longer term fundamentals and see if they've been the driver of the negative returns. View our latest analysis for Simon Property Group While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.While the share price declined over five years, Simon Property Group actually managed to increase EPS by an average of 2.5% per year. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.By glancing at these numbers, we'd posit that the the market had expectations of much higher growth, five years ago. Having said that, we might get a better idea of what's going on with the stock by looking at other metrics.The most recent dividend was actually lower than it was in the past, so that may have sent the share price lower. On top of that, revenue has declined by 3.4% per year over the half decade; that could be a red flag for some investors.The image below shows how earnings and revenue have tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-and-revenue-growthIt's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. On the other hand, we think the revenue and earnings trends are much more meaningful measures of the business. You can see what analysts are predicting for Simon Property Group in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.Story continuesWhat About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Simon Property Group the TSR over the last 5 years was -6.5%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.A Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that Simon Property Group shareholders are down 24% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 22%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 1.3% per year over five years. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Simon Property Group better, we need to consider many other factors.

Where [retailers] are seeing the most pressure right now is in eCommerce.”Retail ResilienceUnlike many of its large cap multinational peers, especially those with ties to consumers and retail, Simon Property showed unusual strength and confidence for the three months ending Sept. 30. Not only did SPG’s occupancy and base rent levels both increase 1.7% for the quarter, but the company also raised its earnings forecast and dividend for the quarter to come.Additionally, Simon went out of his way to stress the point that his company had paid out $39 billion in dividends over the past 30 years, through numerous up and down economic cycles, and had emerged as a stronger, more astute and better operator as a result.“Many have tried to kill off physical retail real estate and in particular enclosed malls,” Simon said, pointing to the closed store COVID-era in which naysayers argued physical retail was gone forever.“However, brick-and-mortar retail is strong, and eCommerce is flatlining,” he said. “Why do I bring this up constantly? Well, because hopefully this will put an end to the so-called negative mall narrative, as you can’t pay those dividends without a strong underlying business.”Beneath the MallsFor all its global investments in real estate, SPG is also a retailer, with direct and indirect stakes in dozens of brands ranging from JCPenney to Reebok to Nautica, Eddie Bauer, Aeropostale and more via its SPARC Group portfolio held with Authentic Brands Group.Story continuesFor Simon, these so-called Other Platform Investments or OPIs are also performing well, as the company’s efforts to revive distressed brands that it acquires at a discount is proving to be a lucrative and growing side business.“We have approximately $475 million of net investment within our Other Platform Investments,” Simon told analysts, noting the $300 million in cash it generates. “For those of you who like math, that is a 60% return on investment, and we believe the value of our investments in OPI is worth over $2 billion.”As such, SPG said it plans to expand upon its asset management efforts, pointing to its recently announced strategic partnership with Jamestown, a real estate investment and management firm.“We see great opportunity with this investment to capitalize on the growing asset and investment management businesses,” Simon said. “We expect to grow their asset management business and accelerate our densification opportunities.”The deal that is expected to close prior to the end of this year.While Simon said any CEO is “always worried about the macro environment,” he also assured investors that he does not want to see a recession and hopes there isn’t one but noted the “counter cyclicality” of such economic upheaval has historically offered his company great opportunities to acquire and redevelop distressed properties at attractive prices.“I will tell you what gives me unbelievable confidence going into the next few years is the realization that, as we have been saying, don’t underestimate physical retail,” he said. “We feel really good because physical retail is where the action is. It’s where the return on investment is.”For all PYMNTS retail coverage, subscribe to the daily Retail Newsletter.]"

(NYSE:HCA)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/sentiment-still-eluding-hca-healthcare-140048977.html,1667397648,STORY,['HCA'],"[HCA Healthcare, Inc.'s (NYSE:HCA) price-to-earnings (or ""P/E"") ratio of 11.8x might make it look like a buy right now compared to the market in the United States, where around half of the companies have P/E ratios above 15x and even P/E's above 28x are quite common. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the reduced P/E.While the market has experienced earnings growth lately, HCA Healthcare's earnings have gone into reverse gear, which is not great. It seems that many are expecting the dour earnings performance to persist, which has repressed the P/E. If this is the case, then existing shareholders will probably struggle to get excited about the future direction of the share price. Check out our latest analysis for HCA Healthcare peKeen to find out how analysts think HCA Healthcare's future stacks up against the industry? In that case, our free report is a great place to start.How Is HCA Healthcare's Growth Trending?In order to justify its P/E ratio, HCA Healthcare would need to produce sluggish growth that's trailing the market.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 8.7%. Even so, admirably EPS has lifted 83% in aggregate from three years ago, notwithstanding the last 12 months. So we can start by confirming that the company has generally done a very good job of growing earnings over that time, even though it had some hiccups along the way.Looking ahead now, EPS is anticipated to climb by 8.4% per year during the coming three years according to the analysts following the company. Meanwhile, the rest of the market is forecast to expand by 9.6% per year, which is not materially different.With this information, we find it odd that HCA Healthcare is trading at a P/E lower than the market. Apparently some shareholders are doubtful of the forecasts and have been accepting lower selling prices.What We Can Learn From HCA Healthcare's P/E?Using the price-to-earnings ratio alone to determine if you should sell your stock isn't sensible, however it can be a practical guide to the company's future prospects.Story continuesWe've established that HCA Healthcare currently trades on a lower than expected P/E since its forecast growth is in line with the wider market. There could be some unobserved threats to earnings preventing the P/E ratio from matching the outlook. At least the risk of a price drop looks to be subdued, but investors seem to think future earnings could see some volatility.It is also worth noting that we have found 3 warning signs for HCA Healthcare (1 is concerning!) that you need to take into consideration.If you're unsure about the strength of HCA Healthcare's business, why not explore our interactive list of stocks with solid business fundamentals for some other companies you may have missed.Have feedback on this article?

(NYSE:SQ), and S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAM) is one of the premier large-cap picks from the Goldman Sachs stock portfolio. Here is what Nelson Capital Management has to say about Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:AKAM) in its Q2 2021 investor letter:“In the technology sector, we sold our position in Akamai (tkr: AKAM). Akamai has benefitted from higher internet traffic during the pandemic, but we expect the company to face difficult comparable earnings results in 2021 and growth expectations going forward remain low.”9. NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 29NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) is a Texas-based energy company that engages in electricity generation, power transmission, and distribution.

The company promotes the electrification of the automotive industry and sustainable energy for solar strings, industrial power, and storage systems. Securities filings for Q2 2022 reveal that the Goldman Sachs stock portfolio featured nearly 20.4 million ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) shares, worth $2.3 billion and representing 0.53% of the total holdings. On October 31, ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) reported its Q3 results, posting a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $1.45 and a revenue of $2.2 billion, topping Wall Street estimates by $0.14 and $80 million, respectively.

The analyst noted that ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) posted better than forecasted results, but slightly mixed Q4 guidance as Consumer/Compute/Industrial weighed. He also said that gross margins and a larger 2023 capex were disappointing.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 39 hedge funds were long ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) at the end of June 2022, compared to 48 funds in the last quarter.

The company reported 49% gross margins in 1Q22 which met the new management team’s 48%-50% long-term target after revising it higher just one quarter ago. We believe ON has a clear path to &gt;50% gross margins, and its financial results reflect the ongoing structural improvements in both manufacturing and products, cost initiatives, product mix and rising prices. Growing demand for chips in electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, advanced driver assistance (multiple cameras), factory automation and machine vision should drive sustainable high single-digit top-line growth. With shares trading at an attractive discount to our PMV estimate, we continued to move this holding up the Crop of the portfolio.”7. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 40SolarEdge Technologies, Inc.

Riley analyst Christopher Souther maintained a Buy recommendation on SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) but trimmed the price target on the shares to $377 from $385.

(NASDAQ:SEDG), compared to 47 funds in the prior quarter. Ian Simm’s Impax Asset Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 580,909 shares worth $158.20 million. Here is what ClearBridge International Growth EAFE Portfolio has to say about SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We are well-positioned to participate in the accelerating energy transition.

Israel-based SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ:SEDG) expects to see significant growth in solar installations in this market led by Germany and Italy, among others, where consumers are not only demanding solar on the roof but a complete system solution including batteries. This phenomenon is accelerating revenue growth for these companies.”6. Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 46Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is one of the top large-cap picks from the Goldman Sachs stock portfolio. The investment firm owned 23.7 million Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) shares in the second quarter of 2022, worth $2.16 billion and representing 0.48% of the total 13F securities. On October 26, Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.15 per share, in line with previous.

(NYSE:SQ), and S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) is one of the prominent large-cap plays in the Goldman Sachs stock portfolio. Here is what Leaven Partners has to say about Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In our last quarterly letter, I briefly mentioned that the consensus estimates for corporate profits appeared to be a bit too sanguine. I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), have recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6% from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Large-Cap Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:11 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks To Buy10 Cheap Small Cap Stocks To Invest In10 Best Utility Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

If you want to see more of the biggest finance companies by market cap, go directly to 5 Biggest Finance Companies in the World.When most people think of finance companies, they think of banks. In terms of banks, there are several types of banks. Traditional community banks take deposits and make loans to individuals. Corporate banks take deposits from generally bigger corporations and make loans to bigger corporations. Lastly, capital market banks help companies and governments issue bonds and stocks in the capital market. In addition to banks, some of the world's biggest financial companies help operate payment networks that help merchants accept payments from their customers.Given their growth, many of today's biggest modern banks offer community banking, corporate banking, capital market services, and other services such as asset management.Economically ImportantFinancial companies operate at the center of modern economies.If the banks do a good job in terms of making quality loans, a country's economy can expand and growth can be faster than it would have otherwise. The banks themselves could potentially make more money in the long run.If banks don't do as good of a job in terms of making quality loans, a country's growth rate might not be as fast as it could have been. The bank's earnings might not be as high as it could be in the long run.Given their importance, many of the world's leading financial institutions are actually considered systematically important and are more regulated as a result.Leading Financial CompaniesGiven the size of the United States economy, many of the world's leading financial companies are based in the United States. With that the U.S. dollar is used as a reserve currency in many nations around the world, many of the leading U.S. financial companies have global operations too.With the growth of the Chinese economy in the past few decades, China's economy is now the second largest economy in the world. As a result, several of the leading Chinese banks rank among the world's largest financial companies. Given the Chinese government plays a much bigger role in the economy than Western governments do, Chinese banks are often run in the interest of the Chinese state rather than in the interest of shareholders at times. As a result, their financial performances may not match that of Western banks even if the economy of China is growing faster.Story continuesGiven its huge population and rapidly growing economy, one Indian bank also ranks among the most valuable financial companies in the world.2022Given the high inflation this year, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates five times already in 2022 and many analysts think the central bank will likely raise rates even further by the end of the year.As a result of the interest rate hikes, many leading financial companies have faced headwinds.Although higher interest rates can benefit traditional community banks by making it easier for them to earn more in net interest income, too rapid of interest rate hikes or too high of interest rates can slow economic activity, which can increase write-offs and lower overall earnings. Given the decline in some bank stocks this year, it seems the market thinks that the write-offs from the potential recession next year might outweigh the positives of higher net interest income, at least in the near term.The higher interest rates have caused markets to decline in value, which hasn't been good for the asset management businesses of some banks. Lastly, the higher interest rates have caused the U.S dollar to strengthen, which isn't good in U.S. dollar terms for some international companies that do business with major financial institutions.Given the uncertainty, it can be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 17 Biggest Finance Companies in the World, we took the 17 largest companies by market capitalization from companiesmarketcap.com's Largest financial service companies by market cap list as of 10/30.17 Biggest Finance Companies in the World17.

LBRT has gained 3.5% since its third-quarter earnings announcement on Oct 19. The company comfortably beat top and bottom-line estimates.What Did Liberty Energy’s Earnings Unveil?Liberty Energy announced third-quarter 2022 earnings per share of 78 cents, which handily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 63 cents and turned around from the year-earlier loss of 22 cents.The Denver-CO-based oil and gas equipment company’s outperformance reflects the impact of strong execution, higher activity and increased service pricing, which more than offset rising costs.Total revenues came in at $1.2 billion, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1 billion and 81.8% above the year-ago level of $653.7 million.Meanwhile, third-quarter adjusted EBITDA was $276.9 million against the prior-year quarter figure of just $32 million.As part of its shareholder return policy, LBRT repurchased $70 million of its stock at an average price of $14.89 apiece and reinstated a quarterly cash dividend of 5 cents.Liberty Energy Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseLiberty Energy Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseLiberty Energy Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Liberty Energy Inc. Quote Balance Sheet &amp; Capital ExpenditureAs of Sep 30, Liberty had approximately $24 million in cash and cash equivalents. The pressure pumper’s long-term debt of $252.7 million represented a debt-to-capitalization of 15.2%. Further, the company’s liquidity — cash balance plus revolving credit facility — amounted to $298 million.In the reported quarter, the company spent $95 million on its capital program.GuidanceDespite growing risk in financial markets due to the aggressive monetary tightening by central banks and the fallout from China’s zero-COVID lockdown policy, Liberty management believes that the energy market remains tight. On top of this, the OPEC+ supply cut, sanctions on Russian oil and limited availability of spare production capacity are likely to further strengthen the demand for North American energy.This means upstream operators are drilling more wells to increase output that has remained depressed over the past two years due to the lack of investment, supply-chain issues, scarcity of labor and equipment attrition. With crude demand set to remain robust and eventually surpass pre-COVID record, most of the domestic fracking capacity is on the verge of being exhausted. In this context, Liberty management sees elevated demand for its next-generation fleet that supports the clients’ requirements for quality and reliability. Notwithstanding holiday and seasonal weather, the Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company sees fourth-quarter results in line with the strong third quarter.You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Story continuesEarnings Snapshot for Oilfield Service ProvidersWith Liberty belonging to the larger oilfield service industry, let’s see how some of the bigger well-known companies have performed this earnings season.Schlumberger SLB, the largest oilfield contractor, announced third-quarter earnings of 63 cents per share (excluding charges and credits), which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 55 cents. SLB recorded total revenues of $7.5 billion, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.7%.Schlumberger’s strong quarterly earnings resulted from strong activities in land and offshore resources in North America and Latin America. In more good news for investors, SLB generated a free cash flow of $1.1 billion during the period. The company’s capital expenditure came in at $382 million. As of Sep 30, 2022, SLB had approximately $3.6 billion in cash and short-term investments. It had long-term debt of $12.5 billion at the end of the third quarter.Smaller rival Halliburton HAL reported third-quarter adjusted net income per share of 60 cents, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 56 cents and well above the year-ago quarter profit of 28 cents. HAL’s outperformance reflects stronger-than-expected profit from both its divisions that came in spite of the company’s exit from Russia.Meanwhile, revenues of $5.4 billion were 38.8% higher than the corresponding period of 2021 and above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.3 billion. North American revenues rose 63.2% year over year to $2.6 billion, while revenues from Halliburton’s international operations were up 21.2% from the year-ago period to $2.7 billion. Investors should know that HAL has outsized exposure to the North American land drilling market.Finally, Baker Hughes BKR — which along with SLB and HAL makes up the ‘Big Three’ oil services firms — reported third-quarter adjusted earnings of 26 cents per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a penny. BKR’s better-than-expected results were primarily driven by higher contributions from the Oilfield Services business unit.However, revenues for the July-September period totaled $5.4 billion, underperforming the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.4%. This was mainly caused by lackluster sales from Baker Hughes’ Turbomachinery &amp; Process Solutions unit, which suffered due to a dip in equipment and project volumes. In an encouraging development, BKR generated a free cash flow of $417 million in the reported quarter compared with $305 million in the year-ago period.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out George Soros Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Large-Cap Stock Picks. George Soros, a Hungarian-American businessman, founded Soros Fund Management in 1970. Soros Fund Management is a New York-based hedge fund which carved its place as one of the most profitable funds on Wall Street, however, it is now structured as a family office. The George Soros stock portfolio is worth $5.6 billion as of the second quarter of 2022, and the billionaire makes highly leveraged investments keeping in mind the currency movements and commodity prices, as well as fundamental macroeconomic and market analysis. The condition of the housing market also plays an important role in his investment decisions. Soros tends to invest in large-cap, small-cap, exchange traded funds, and both growth and value plays. Large-cap stocks are usually perceived as less risky. These tend to be companies that are very stable and dominate their respective sectors, with market capitalization ranging from $10 billion to $200 billion. These prominent firms have fortress balance sheets and the ability to withstand market volatility. Large-cap companies also usually return a percentage of their profits to shareholders as dividends, which helps investors navigate a downturn in the economy relatively better. Some of the best large-cap stocks in the George Soros stock portfolio are Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Our Methodology We selected the top large-cap stock picks from George Soros’ stock portfolio as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. George Soros Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Large-Cap Stock PicksGeorge Soros Stock Portfolio: Top Large-Cap Stock Picks10. Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) is a Colorado-based communications company that provides a range of wireless, data, video, voice, and managed services to residential customers, businesses, government entities, and educational and medical institutions. In Q2 2022, the George Soros stock portfolio had 1.75 million shares of Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA), worth $202.35 million and representing 3.6% of the total 13F securities. Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) has been part of the Soros portfolio since the second quarter of 2016. Story continuesOn May 10, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft maintained a Buy recommendation on Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $158 from $196.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) was part of 27 public stock portfolios, compared to 26 in the prior quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management held the leading position in the company, comprising 8.30 million shares worth $960.2 million. Like Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) is one of the top large-cap picks from the George Soros stock portfolio. Alphyn Capital made the following comment about Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In retrospect, I wish I had cut the position in Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) more aggressively last quarter. Fears of fixed wireless and fiber competition have weighed heavily on Charter and Liberty’s share prices. Tom Rutledge’s unexpected early retirement from the CEO role has not helped matters.I believe the sentiment is now overly pessimistic, and the valuation once again attractive. Revenue growth from broadband ads will likely stall as fixed wireless access programs take a bite out of cable subscribers over the next five years. 4 However, Charter has a fast-growing mobile phone business through an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Verizon. Given its cost-effective access to Verizon’s mobile telephony infrastructure, it provides a branded mobile phone service to retail customers at competitive rates. For example, Unlimited pricing starts at $29.99/month, including taxes and fees, vs. $35-55/month plus taxes and fees for Verizon’s plans.Wireless generates approximately $725m in revenues for Charter per quarter, around 6% of the total, and is growing 40% per year. Should this continue, Wireless could return Charter to mid-single-digit revenue growth and “drive meaningful EBITDA for Charter,” as revenues scale over a low cost base. With approximately 25m non-Charter potential wireless customers within the area it serves, there is plenty of room for growth.”9. Rivian Automotive, Inc.

Shares of Rivian declined 48.2% in the second quarter as investors continued rotating out of long-duration assets and have become increasingly concerned about capital intensity and cash burn.At the same time, Rivian continues to be impacted by supply chain issues which are causing delays in its production ramp. Rivian is addressing those challenges by diversifying its supply chain to alleviate shortages while also consolidating the number of variants in development to reduce cash burn (the company guided that current cash will be enough to support the company’s future platform launch ‘R2’ in 2025). Rivian recently reported stronger-than-expected second quarter production numbers while reiterating its annual guidance of producing 25,000 units.As semiconductor shortages ease, we believe that the company will be able to rapidly ramp its production. We retain conviction in the shares given management’s vision, Rivian’s product positioning, the company’s relationship with Amazon.com, and its strong balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, Rivian had $17 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which will help it overcome the current challenges while taking advantage of the long-term opportunity as the market transitions to electric vehicles.”8.

Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is a Texas-based homebuilding company that constructs and sells residential homes under the D.R. Horton, America's Builder, Express Homes, Emerald Homes, and Freedom Homes brands. In Q2 2022, the George Soros stock portfolio featured nearly 3 million shares of D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), worth $197 million and representing 3.5% of the total holdings. Raymond James analyst Buck Horne on October 21 downgraded D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) to Outperform from Strong Buy with a price target of $77, down from $103. The downgrade factors in the analyst’s more concerned outlook on the housing market as mortgage rates have driven affordability to uncharted highs. However, he remains constructive on D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) in this environment as the sector’s most cost-efficient producer of single-family housing.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) was part of 44 public stock portfolios at the end of June 2022, compared to 52 in the last quarter. John Armitage’s Egerton Capital Limited is the leading position holder in the company, with 7.6 million shares worth $504 million. Here is what Third Avenue Management specifically said about D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is the largest homebuilder in the US by volume (the company sold more than 90k homes in the past year) with a well-recognized focus on delivering quality product at the entry-level price point (its average selling price is less than $400k) and market-leading positions in key Sunbelt markets.While the near-term outlook for DR Horton remains uncertain given the adjustments occurring in the US residential markets, the medium-to-long-term prospects for volume-based homebuilders with super-strong balance sheets and scale advantages continue to be promising in Fund Management’s view. More specifically, (i) residential inventories remain around record-low levels in most major markets when gauged by aggregate units available (see chart below), (ii) demand for single-family residences seem to have multiple secular drivers as the largest generation in US history (the “millennial cohort”) enters its prime home buying years and desires more space not only due to “life events” but also “remote” and “hybrid” working arrangements, and (iii) significant inflation in rental rates for multi-family units in urban areas has left the rent-to-own proposition for single-family homes in suburban areas in a compelling range (particularly in the Sunbelt region which is experiencing outsized job growth and wage growth relative to broader national figures).In Fund Management’s view, the two industry participants that seem most likely to take part in this shift include DR Horton and Lennar Corp. (a long-held position in the Fund). In conjunction, these two “blue-chip builders” now account for approximately 10% of the Fund’s capital, as well as roughly one out of every five new homes built in the Sunbelt. They would also qualify under Third Avenue Founder Marty Whitman’s “Safe and Cheap” maxim as both companies are nearly “net-cash” (i.e., more cash than debt) with common stocks trading at less than five times trailing earnings, on average.”6.

However, shares fell 17.5% during the quarter due to adverse foreign currency movements weighing on next quarter’s guidance and investor concerns about macroeconomic uncertainty impacting client demand.

A replay will be available two hours following the conference call.Use of Non-GAAP Financial InformationThis press release contains information about Aptiv's financial results which are not presented in accordance with GAAP. Specifically, Adjusted Revenue Growth, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share and Cash Flow Before Financing are non-GAAP financial measures. Adjusted Revenue Growth represents the year-over-year change in reported net sales relative to the comparable period, excluding the impact on net sales from currency exchange, commodity movements, acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions. Adjusted Operating Income represents net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax (expense) benefit, equity income (loss), net of tax, amortization, restructuring, other acquisition and portfolio project costs, asset impairments, other charges related to the Ukraine/Russia conflict and gains (losses) on business divestitures and other transactions. Other acquisition and portfolio project costs include costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses and to plan and execute product portfolio transformation actions, including business and product acquisitions and divestitures. Adjusted Operating Income margin is defined as Adjusted Operating Income as a percentage of net sales. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before depreciation and amortization (including asset impairments), interest expense, income tax (expense) benefit, other income (expense), net, equity income (loss), net of tax, restructuring and other special items.Adjusted Net Income represents net income attributable to Aptiv before amortization, restructuring and other special items, including the tax impact thereon. Adjusted Net Income Per Share represents Adjusted Net Income divided by the Adjusted Weighted Average Number of Diluted Shares Outstanding for the period. The Adjusted Weighted Average Number of Diluted Shares Outstanding assumes the application of the if-converted method of share dilution, if not already applied for GAAP purposes of calculating the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding. Cash Flow Before Financing represents cash provided by (used in) operating activities plus cash provided by (used in) investing activities, adjusted for the purchase price of business acquisitions and other transactions, the cost of significant technology investments and net proceeds from the divestiture of discontinued operations and other significant businesses.Effective on January 1, 2022, the Company now excludes amortization expense of intangible assets from the calculation of Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share. Financial results reported in this release for both the current and historical period have been prepared under this new definition. Outlook information presented above is also calculated under this new definition. The forward-looking non-GAAP measures presented in this release are reconciled under this new definition to their closest GAAP financial measure on pages 18 and 19.Management believes the non-GAAP financial measures used in this press release are useful to both management and investors in their analysis of the Company's financial position, results of operations and liquidity. In particular, management believes Adjusted Revenue Growth, Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Net Income Per Share and Cash Flow Before Financing are useful measures in assessing the Company's ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding GAAP measure, provide improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance and that may obscure underlying business results and trends. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes.Such non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in the attached supplemental schedules at the end of this press release. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP and, as calculated, may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.1     Represents global vehicle production weighted to the geographic regions in which the Company generates its revenue (""AWM"").About AptivAptiv is a global technology company that develops safer, greener and more connected solutions enabling a more sustainable future of mobility.

Such non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled to their closest GAAP financial measure in the following schedules.Effective on January 1, 2022, the Company now excludes amortization expense of intangible assets from the calculation of Adjusted Operating Income, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income Per Share. Financial results reported in this release for both the current and historical period have been prepared under this new definition and are reconciled as such in the tables below.Adjusted Revenue Growth: Adjusted Revenue Growth is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's financial performance which management believes is useful to investors in assessing the Company's ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance and which may obscure underlying business results and trends. Our management utilizes Adjusted Revenue Growth in its financial decision making process, to evaluate performance of the Company and for internal reporting, planning and forecasting purposes. Adjusted Revenue Growth is defined as the year-over-year change in reported net sales relative to the comparable period, excluding the impact on net sales from currency exchange, commodity movements, acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions. Not all companies use identical calculations of Adjusted Revenue Growth, therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Three Months Ended September 30, 2022Reported net sales % change26 %Less: foreign currency exchange and commodities(7) %Adjusted revenue growth33 %Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022Reported net sales % change12 %Less: foreign currency exchange and commodities(3) %Adjusted revenue growth15 % Adjusted Operating Income: Adjusted Operating Income is presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's financial performance which management believes is useful to investors in assessing the Company's ongoing financial performance that, when reconciled to the corresponding U.S. GAAP measure, provides improved comparability between periods through the exclusion of certain items that management believes are not indicative of the Company's core operating performance and which may obscure underlying business results and trends. Our management utilizes Adjusted Operating Income in its financial decision making process, to evaluate performance of the Company and for internal reporting, planning and forecasting purposes. Management also utilizes Adjusted Operating Income as the key performance measure of segment income or loss and for planning and forecasting purposes to allocate resources to our segments, as management also believes this measure is most reflective of the operational profitability or loss of our operating segments. Adjusted Operating Income is defined as net income before interest expense, other income (expense), net, income tax (expense) benefit, equity income (loss), net of tax, amortization, restructuring and other special items. Not all companies use identical calculations of Adjusted Operating Income, therefore this presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies. Operating income margin represents Operating income as a percentage of net sales, and Adjusted Operating Income margin represents Adjusted Operating Income as a percentage of net sales. Consolidated Adjusted Operating IncomeThree Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021($ in millions)$Margin$Margin$Margin$MarginNet income attributable to Aptiv$    301$    101$    345$    559Interest expense5836157114Other (income) expense, net(20)(1)44(2)Income tax expense592596101Equity loss, net of tax6751202146Net income (loss) attributable to      noncontrolling interest53(21)11Operating income$    47010.2 %$    2155.9 %$    8236.4 %$    9298.1 %Amortization3737112111...]"
150,689313eb-c672-3d70-aa7e-484693e06bb9,PRGO,2022-11-03,Analysts Estimate PetIQ (PETQ) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-petiq-petq-report-140102181.html,1667397662,STORY,"['PETQ', 'PRGO']","[The market expects PetIQ (PETQ) to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook is important in assessing the company's earnings picture, but a powerful factor that might influence its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 9. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis pet medications and products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.06 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -40%.Revenues are expected to be $203.9 million, down 3.2% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 28.13% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for PetIQ?For PetIQ, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -100%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that PetIQ will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that PetIQ would post earnings of $0.34 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.51, delivering a surprise of +50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.PetIQ doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Medical - Products industry, Perrigo (PRGO), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.66 per share for the quarter ended September 2022. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +46.7%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $1.14 billion, up 9.4% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Perrigo has been revised 3.2% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%, reflecting an equal Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #4 (Sell), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Perrigo will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed EPS estimates just once.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AIG reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted operating earnings of 66 cents per share, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 11.9%. The bottom line of AIG slumped 32% year over year in the third quarter.Operating revenues of $11.3 billion declined from $11.7 billion a year ago and lagged the consensus estimate of $11.5 billion and our estimate of $11.6 billion.The better-than-expected earnings were supported by the solid performance in the General Insurance despite the negative impacts of Hurricane Ian, and increased Life and Retirement premiums. However, the positives were partially offset by reduced alternative investment income and higher expenses.American International Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise American International Group, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseAmerican International Group, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | American International Group, Inc. QuoteQuarterly Operational UpdateTotal net investment income (NII) tumbled 28.2% year over year to $2,668 million due to a decline in alternative investment returns, and reduced call and tender income. Nevertheless, the downside was partly offset by higher interest rates. The figure was lower than our estimate of $3,400 million.AIG’s total benefits, losses and expenses of $10,755 million increased 0.9% year over year primarily due to higher policyholder benefits and losses incurred. The figure was higher than our estimate of $10,106.1 million.Adjusted return on common equity deteriorated 280 basis points (bps) year over year to 3.7% in the third quarter.Segmental PerformancesGeneral InsuranceThe segment reported net premiums written of $6,403 million, which declined 3% year over year but grew 3% on a constant-dollar basis. The metric was lower than our estimate of $6,990 million. A decline in production in Warranty within North America Personal Insurance and International Personal Insurance affected the results. However, the downside was partly offset by improvements on the back of continuous rate hikes, strong renewal retentions and solid new business production.Story continuesUnderwriting income of $168 million soared from $20 million in the third quarter. The same comprised catastrophe losses (CATs) of $600 million, which included around $450 million for Hurricane Ian, comparing favorably with CATs of $628 million in the prior-year quarter.The segment’s combined ratio improved 240 bps year over year to 97.3% in the quarter under review. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 94.2%.Life and RetirementAIG closed the IPO of Corebridge Financial, Inc. CRBG in September, the holding company of its Life and Retirement unit. Following the move, AIG has 77.7% of Corebridge and is expected to combine CRBG’s results of operations in its Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements.Premiums of the segment increased 34.9% year over year to $1,404 million in the third quarter. The figure was higher than our estimate of $1,080.3 million.Meanwhile, premiums and deposits of $8,894 million jumped from $7,234 million a year ago. Adjusted revenues of the segment amounted to $4,336 million, down from $4,444 million due to lower alternative investments. The figure was lower than our estimate of $4,352.9 million.The segment’s adjusted pre-tax income of $589 million fell from $877 million in the third quarter, primarily due to lower NII. The metric was significantly lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $997.4 million.Financial Position (as of Sep 30, 2022)American International exited the third quarter with a cash balance of $2,294 million, which increased from $2,198 million at 2021-end. Total assets of $522.9 billion decreased from $596.1 billion at 2021-end.Short- and long-term debt of $24.5 billion rose from $23.7 billion at the prior-year end.Total equity slumped to $41 billion from $68.9 billion at the prior-year end.

The type test certification assures hospitals and imaging centers that the 3Dimensions 2D and 3D systems have each passed a rigorous series of mechanical and clinical tests demonstrating that the system meets the image quality, radiation exposure and stability standards set by EUREF for screening and diagnostic mammography equipment. Both mammography systems were tested at two clinical sites in the Netherlands for screening and diagnostic uses.""The work being done by EUREF contributes greatly to ensuring women receive quality screenings and care across Europe. We are honored to be the first DBT system to meet their rigorous standards,"" said Tanja Brycker, Vice President, Strategic Development, Breast &amp; Skeletal Health and Gynaecological Surgical Solutions at Hologic. ""EUREF certification is not easy to come by. We are proud that our 3Dimensions system has joined two of our other mammography systems in being recognized. These certifications reflect our commitment to developing high-quality medical technology that improves women’s health.""The 3Dimensions system features breakthrough improvements designed to transform the patient experience without compromising on speed, dose or accuracy. The system is the fastest, highest resolution breast tomosynthesis system available,2 and is clinically proven to be more comfortable3 for patients while providing an enhanced workflow for radiologists.

HOLX reported fourth-quarter fiscal 2022 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 82 cents, down 49.1% year over year. However, the bottom line surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 32.3%.The adjustments include charges and benefits related to the amortization of acquired intangible assets, certain asset impairment charges and restructuring and integration/consolidation costs among others.The company’s GAAP EPS was 47 cents in the quarter compared with the year-ago quarter’s EPS of $1.28, reflecting a 63.3% plunge.Full-fiscal adjusted EPS was $6.02, a 28.4% decline from fiscal 2021.Revenues in DetailRevenues totaled $953.3 million in the reported quarter, down 27.6% year over year (down 25.6% at the constant exchange rate or CER). The metric however surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 9.9%.

Blood Screening revenues of $7.9 million fell 51.5% year over year at CER.Revenues in the Breast Health segment fell 17.7% from the year-ago period (down 16% at CER) to $275.1 million. This primarily resulted from lower gantry revenues due to semiconductor chip shortages. Further, outside the United States, Breast Health sales declined 15.6% at CER.Story continuesRevenues at the GYN Surgical business rose 9.3% year over year (up 11.4% at CER) to $133.3 million, led by improved procedure volume as COVID prevalence declined.Revenues at Skeletal Health improved 1.7% year over year (up 3.7% at CER) to $24 million.Operational UpdateIn the fiscal fourth quarter, the company-provided adjusted gross margin contracted 690 basis points (bps) to 62.5%. According to the company, the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to a year-over-year decline in COVID-19 assay sales and lower capital equipment sales due to supply chain challenges related to semiconductor chip shortages, which impacted its Breast Health business.The company’s adjusted operating margin was 27.9%, down 1460 bps.Financial UpdateHologic ended fiscal 2022 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.34 billion compared with $2.38 billion at the end of the fiscal third quarter of 2022.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings per share is pegged at 79 cents.Our TakeHologic delivered better-than-expected revenues and earnings for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022. However, on a year-over-year basis, both the figures were significantly down. The significant decline in COVID-19 assay revenues, along with supply chain challenges related to semiconductor chips in the Breast Health business, dragged total revenues down.

At launch, ads will run 15 or 30 seconds in length, with some running prior to the start of a program while others will be mid-roll ads.Wall Street analysts are largely bullish on the profitability aspects of the new ad tier, and advertising experts refer to the debut as a make-or-break moment for the media industry.""It is absolutely a pivotal moment for the industry,"" Kevin Krim, CEO of advertising measurement platform EDO, told Yahoo Finance, citing Amazon's (AMZN) Thursday Night Football as another watershed moment when streaming, subscription, and ad-supported went to the masses.Looking back, the executive explained, this ""will be the moment where the vast majority of Americans became crystal clear that there's going to be a new way to get the must-watch TV that they care about — and it's going to be through a subscription-based and an ad-supported business model.""Amid concerns that Netflix subscribers will trade down to the ad-supported version, Citi Managing Director Jason Bazinet previously told Yahoo Finance Live that he views the introduction of advertising as a lucrative revenue driver.""It's not a spin down risk — it's a spin up opportunity,"" the analyst maintained, estimating that the company could secure $10 or more in advertising revenue per ad-tier subscriber in the U.S.""Big Mouth"" on Netflix. (Screenshot/Netflix)""I think what we have learned as an industry is that there's a limit to the number of consumers out there that will pay,"" EDO's Krim said. ""Advertising is a really smart way to subsidize those subscription fees.""Story continuesKrim added that streaming is going back to basics as its new dual revenue model mimics that of traditional cable television.""This is our new future,"" he maintained. ""You won't see anyone going backwards. I'm absolutely confident that ads will be part of Netflix's future.""The streaming giant is currently utilizing a fixed price model for advertisers (and would not reveal its cost-per-thousand rate), noting that it's open to adjusting that model in the future.Netflix Worldwide Advertising President Jeremi Gorman previously revealed that the platform ""nearly sold out all of its [ad] inventory"" globally for launch — bucking the trend of a global ad spend slowdown.This is our new future. You won't see anyone going backwards.Kevin Krim, EDO CEO on streaming giants embracing ads'That's where you could start to see tension in this move'Since Netflix's rise to the top of the streaming wars, the platform has adopted has a mass amount of programming with the majority of its content considered ""niche.""""That's where you could start to see tension in this move — tension between this premium niche programming that they source from around the world versus what is typically effective for ad-supported content,"" Krim warned. ""As a programmer, you tend to play it safe in order to attract the largest audience that will still be palatable to advertisers. That's going to push Netflix into uncharted territory from a content strategy perspective.""Netflix reportedly hasn't finalized new licensing agreements with big-name studios that include Disney (DIS), NBCUniversal (CMCSA), Sony Pictures Television (SONY), Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and Lions Gate Entertainment. Those studios serve as suppliers and production houses behind several content-drivers for Netflix like ""Grey's Anatomy"" (Disney), ""The Crown"" (Sony Pictures Television), and ""You"" (NBCUniversal).Consequently, about 5% to 10% of overall content won't be available for users in the ad tier due to varying licensing restrictions across countries.This content is not available due to your privacy preferences.Update your settings here to see it.Other concerns center around ad integration, with analysts hoping that content interruptions don't disrupt the binge model that's made Netflix so successful.""Innovation will be fascinating to watch with a culture like Netflix, which wants to be different and wants to have a good user experience,"" Krim said. ""Over time, I think we'll see brand sponsorship integrations into the content itself. Netflix already does that quite a bit. It's very low key, but they're really one of the best in the industry.""Refining measurement and increasing engagement will be other types of growing pains for Netflix to tackle. The company plans to lean on Nielsen's Digital Ad Ratings system, which will become available some time in 2023, to help advertisers better understand how the platform can reach their target audience.And overall, with Disney entering the ad space next month amid a flurry of existing competitors, Krim stressed the importance of performance:""Streamers today are going to have to prove it or lose it — prove the value of what you're selling because there are too many other choices for ad buyers.""Alexandra is a Senior Entertainment and Media Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

NOV reported a third-quarter 2022 adjusted profit of 8 cents per share, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of a profit of 15 cents. The underperformance can be attributed to much higher expenses in the form of provision for income taxes in the reported quarter.However, the bottom line improved from the year-ago loss of 18 cents per share due to significantly higher revenues.NOV’s total revenues of $1.89 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.2% and rose 40.9% from the year-ago sales of $1.34 billion, primarily due to better-than-expected performances in major segments.Segmental PerformanceRig Technologies: The unit produced $511 million in third-quarter revenues, which edged past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $493 million and also compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s $390 million.Adjusted EBITDA of $52 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $43.54 million and increased from the third-quarter 2021 figure of $25 million.The segment’s results outperforming estimates for the reported quarter could be attributed to accelerating revenue conversion from renewable energy projects and demand for the segment’s aftermarket parts and services.Wellbore Technologies: The segment’s revenues of $741 million increased by 46.1% year over year in the third quarter of 2022 and outpaced the consensus mark by about 5.7%.The unit’s adjusted EBITDA of $145 million also surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $128 million and skyrocketed from the year-earlier quarter’s figure of $77 million.The positive comparisons were driven by continued growth in international markets and continued improvements in demand from North America, capitalizing on improving global drilling activity levels and better execution against ongoing supply-chain challenges.Completion &amp; Production Solutions: Compared to the year ago, the segment’s revenues rose 42.5% to $681 million and also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $653 million.Story continuesThe unit’s adjusted EBITDA of $56 million rose from the year-ago quarter’s loss of $5 million and also beat the consensus mark of $32.50 million. This outperformance was primarily due to much-improved execution on offshore projects and the easing of supply-chain constraints, along with healthy demand.NOV Inc.

Investors should know that in the third quarter, NOV reinstated its dividend of 5 cents per share.OutlookFor the fourth quarter, NOV anticipates generating between $100 million and $200 million in free cash flow.NOV expects revenues in Rig Technologies to grow between 5% and 10% sequentially, with incremental margins between 20% and 25% in the fourth quarter.For the Wellbore Technologies unit, the firm expects building momentum in the Eastern Hemisphere. The pent-up demand for its products is to be partially offset by plateauing North American drilling activity, resulting in revenue growth of 2% to 6% in the quarter.The company anticipates revenues to improve, but the flow-through will be limited due to a less favorable product mix in the upcoming quarter.Zacks Rank &amp; Stock PicksNOV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

It is worth considering TJX (TJX), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Discount Stores industry.When looking at the last two reports, this parent of T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and other stores has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 8.16%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the last reported quarter, TJX came out with earnings of $0.69 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.67 per share, representing a surprise of 2.99%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.60 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.68 per share, delivering a surprise of 13.33%.Price and EPS SurpriseWith this earnings history in mind, recent estimates have been moving higher for TJX. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the company is positive, which is a great sign of an earnings beat, especially when you combine this metric with its nice Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.TJX has an Earnings ESP of +0.31% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain.

This particularly applies to tech giants and popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in TJX (TJX) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to TJX for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?TJX's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at TJX's main business drivers.Based in Framingham, MA, The TJX Companies, Inc. is a leading off-price retailer of apparel and home fashions in the U.S. and worldwide. The company’s broad range of assortments at varying prices helps it to reach out to a broad range of consumers.

In fact, The TJX Companies’ low-cost structure sets it apart from other traditional retailers. In order to maintain control on costs, the company engages in the promotion of retail banners, rather than specific brands. The company’s distribution network is also designed in a manner such that helps curtailing costs. Moreover, the company emphasizes on creating strong relations with vendors across different countries, in order leverage buying power.  The TJX Companies operates through four business segments:In the U.S., it operates through two segments, namely, Marmaxx (through stores under the names of T.J. Maxx and Marshalls) and HomeGoods.Story continuesMarmaxx divisions (60.7% of FY22 Sales) sell family apparel (including footwear and accessories), home fashions (including home basics, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor, decorative accessories and giftware) and other merchandise.HomeGoods (18.5% of FY22 Sales) chain offers home basics, giftware, accent furniture, lamps, rugs, wall décor and decorative accessories from around the world, seasonal and other merchandise.In Canada, it operates through TJX Canada (9% of FY22 Sales) through stores under the names of Winners, Marshalls and HomeSense and in Europe, it operates through TJX International (11.8% of FY22 Sales) through stores under the names of T.K. Maxx and HomeSense.Bottom LineAnyone can invest, but building a successful investment portfolio requires research, patience, and a little bit of risk. So, if you had invested in TJX ten years ago, you're likely feeling pretty good about your investment today.According to our calculations, a $1000 investment made in November 2012 would be worth $3,392.91, or a gain of 239.29%, as of November 2, 2022, and this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.In comparison, the S&amp;P 500 gained 170.11% and the price of gold went up -7.59% over the same time frame.Analysts are forecasting more upside for TJX too.Shares of The TJX Companies have outperformed the industry over the past three months.

While some companies like Merck, Biogen, Sanofi and Gilead beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts, a few drug/biotech companies like AbbVie and Novartis reported mixed results.Some companies like Merck and Sanofi raised their sales and earnings expectations for the year while others kept their financial outlook intact as their expectations for better operational growth are likely to be offset by potentially greater currency headwinds.Per the Zacks classification, the pharma/biotech industry comes under the broader Medical sector, which comprises pharma/biotech as well as medical device companies.As of Oct 26, per the Earnings Trends report, 23.2% of the Medical sector participants, constituting 43% of the sector’s market capitalization, have already reported earnings.

Pachiolo went to investigate and then moved quickly to evacuate the two homeowners and three outside contractors who were doing an HVAC installation.""I've been on the job 22 years and this is the first time I've been in a house with gas blowing uncontrolled,"" Pachiolo said. ""I knew what to do because of our constant training. It's what we do.""While the day ended safely, if not for Pachiolo's actions things could have become far worse - even leading to a home explosion. Pachiolo wants customers to know that they can and should take precautions to keep the natural gas in their homes operating safely, especially when they are having HVAC work done. Customers always should evacuate, and then call 911 and PSE&amp;G at 1-800-880-PSEG (7734) to report gas leaks.In this case, the emergency started when the HVAC contractor tried to shut off the gas from the meter inside the basement, while installing a new HVAC system.""The bottom nut snapped,"" Pachiolo said. ""It takes a lot of pressure to snap the nut. ""Pachiolo recommends calling PSE&amp;G for all gas shutoffs. While Pachiolo worked to find a curb shutoff, he had local officials evacuate four more houses and close the street to traffic. He was joined by six more Gas Operations teammates and, even though the road is old and overgrown with weeds that made it difficult to find the shutoff, the area was secure within an hour.""The critical steps taken by each team member, especially Philip Pachiolo being the first responder, resulted in a quick and safe home evacuation with no injuries,"" said Senior Service Supervisor Jon Quigley. ""In addition, the perfect execution of our gas leak procedures - calling for additional support and getting the distribution department involved to shut the gas off from the street - was exceptional. The situation could have been much worse if the team did not work as carefully, and successfully, through the incident.""Story continuesThe homeowners also expressed their thanks to the PSE&amp;G heroes, including Pachiolo and his teammates, Service Specialist Kevin Gunia, Street Leader Christian Figliola, Utility Mechanic Robert Eggert, Street Inspector Scott Bird, Machine Operator Rusty Hunt and Utility Mechanic Juan Martinez.""While PSE&amp;G does train and reinforce Gas Emergency response, in the end, it comes down to human performance. All those involved applied the training to a real-life, critical emergency when it mattered most,"" said Plainfield Gas District Manager Bob Blache. ""I'm very proud of the role everyone played on this emergency, and for keeping our customers and each other safe.""Remember: If you smell gas, exit the building, move at least 350 feet away and call PSE&amp;G at 1-800-880-PSEG (7734) or call 911.

It is worth considering Macy's (M), which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Regional Department Stores industry.This department store operator has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 24.68%.For the most recent quarter, Macy's was expected to post earnings of $0.85 per share, but it reported $1 per share instead, representing a surprise of 17.65%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.82 per share, while it actually produced $1.08 per share, a surprise of 31.71%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Macy's, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change.

The smartphone and the personal computer enable consumers to browse through countless products while sitting at home and have them delivered directly without the hassle of going to stores and physically sifting through products.This has led to massive growth in electronic commerce over the past decade and enabled retailers, such as Amazon, to become trillion dollar firms. These valuations are also supported by market research. For instance, a research report from Reports and Insights believes that the e-commerce market will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.9% from 2022 to 2030, and from its current value of $48 billion to a massive $117.7 billion by the end of the forecast period. The report outlines that machine learning, cloud computing, and 3G and 4G connectivity will drive this growth - as sellers use the advanced technologies to optimize their customer offerings and the connectivity platforms enable more people to connect to the Internet.Another report, this time from Spherical Insights, places an even more optimistic CAGR of 14.3% on the e-commerce sector. It wagers that the industry was worth $810 billion last year and will grow through the aforementioned CAGR to sit at a whopping $1.9 trillion by the end of 2030. Some of the latest trends in the sector, according to the firm, are companies offering novel experiences such as streaming and gaming on their platform, combined with artificial intelligence and voice search to improve cataloging.Today's piece will focus on the largest American e-commerce companies, with the top picks being Amazon.com, Inc.

In addition, we have been impressed with the operational progress this management team has made since taking the helm in 2017. We acknowledge e-commerce trends have been challenged as consumers shift toward in-person experiences post[1]pandemic, but over time we expect industry growth to return to the long-term trend.

Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category. Our biggest detractors was dominated by eBay (NASDAQ:EBAY). Consumer/investor fears about media and e-commerce hit WBD and EBAY and profit taking in Amgen came from early 2022 strength.”8.

Here is what the fund said:In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”Along with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the biggest U.S. e-commerce firms. Click to continue reading and see 5 Biggest E-Commerce Companies In USA.  Suggested Articles:Best Dividend Stocks Under $510 Largest Gas Station Chains in the US15 Biggest Internet Companies in the WorldDisclosure: None. 15 Biggest E-Commerce Companies In USA is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

(NYSE:ZTS),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-zoetis-inc-120057678.html,1667476857,STORY,['ZTS'],"[Does the November share price for Zoetis Inc. (NYSE:ZTS) reflect what it's really worth? Today, we will estimate the stock's intrinsic value by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. This will be done using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Believe it or not, it's not too difficult to follow, as you'll see from our example!Remember though, that there are many ways to estimate a company's value, and a DCF is just one method. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Zoetis Crunching The NumbersWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$2.47bUS$2.81bUS$3.00bUS$3.28bUS$3.49bUS$3.66bUS$3.81bUS$3.95bUS$4.07bUS$4.18bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x3Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 6.38%Est @ 5.06%Est @ 4.13%Est @ 3.49%Est @ 3.04%Est @ 2.72% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.1% US$2.3kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.6kUS$2.5kUS$2.5kUS$2.4kUS$2.3k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$25bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.0%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.1%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$4.2b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.1%– 2.0%) = US$104bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$104b÷ ( 1 + 6.1%)10= US$58bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$82b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$147, the company appears about fair value at a 16% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Zoetis as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

We reported 2% operational growth in adjusted net income this quarter. This lower than usual growth on the bottom line was due primarily to a more favorable tax rate in the year-ago quarter.""Story continues""While we remain confident in the strength and growth drivers of our business, we are lowering 2022 guidance to reflect lower than expected sales in the second half of the year related to continued supply constraints, veterinary workforce challenges and recent changes to foreign exchange rates.""QUARTERLY HIGHLIGHTSZoetis organizes and manages its commercial operations across two segments: United States (U.S.) and International. Within these segments, the company delivers a diverse portfolio of products for companion animals and livestock, tailored to local trends and customer needs. In the third quarter of 2022:Revenue in the U.S. segment was $1.090 billion, an increase of 2% compared with the third quarter of 2021. Sales of companion animal products increased 6%, driven by growth in the company’s parasiticide portfolio, primarily Simparica Trio®, which were tempered by supply constraints. The company’s key dermatology portfolio also contributed to growth across both the Apoquel® and Cytopoint® brands. Sales of livestock products declined 7% in the quarter. Sales of cattle products declined as a result of generic competition for Draxxin®. Sales of poultry products declined due to the expanded use of lower cost alternatives and generic competition for Zoamix®, the company’s alternative to antibiotics in medicated feed additives. Sales of swine products decreased as a result of increased competition for vaccines.Revenue in the International segment was $889 million, a decrease of 2% on a reported basis and an increase of 8% operationally compared with the third quarter of 2021. Sales of companion animal products grew 6% on a reported basis and 17% operationally. Growth resulted from increased sales of the company’s recently launched monoclonal antibody products for osteoarthritis pain, Librela® and Solensia®, as well as increased sales in the key dermatology portfolio across both the Apoquel and Cytopoint brands, including the recently launched chewable version of Apoquel. Companion animal vaccines and Simparica Trio also contributed to growth in the quarter. Sales of livestock products declined 8% on a reported basis and were flat operationally. Growth in the company’s fish portfolio was primarily the result of increased sales of vaccines across key salmon markets, including Norway and Chile. Sales of sheep products grew due to favorable market conditions and new product launches in Australia, while sales of the company’s poultry portfolio grew due to market growth and demand generation efforts across Latin America. Growth in fish, sheep and poultry was offset by reduced sales in the company’s swine and cattle portfolios. Sales of swine products decreased in the quarter due to supply constraints across international markets, as well as lower sales across Europe due to reduced exports to China and higher input costs for producers. The company’s cattle portfolio declined primarily due to supply constraints and an unfavorable macro environment for producers in Brazil.INVESTMENTS IN GROWTHZoetis continues to pave the way in the development of monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapies to treat osteoarthritis (OA) pain in dogs and cats. Since its last quarterly earnings announcement, the company received approval in Japan and Australia for Librela (bedinvetmab), the first injectable mAb for alleviation of pain associated with OA in dogs. Librela is also approved in the European Union (EU), Canada, Brazil, Chile and other international markets. Additionally, Solensia (frunevetmab), the first injectable mAb for the alleviation of pain associated with OA in cats, was approved in Japan and Chile. It is also approved in the U.S., the EU, Canada, Australia and other international markets. In dermatology, Zoetis received approval in Australia, Canada and Japan for Apoquel Chewable Tablets. Previously approved in the EU, Mexico and other international markets, the new chewable version of Apoquel (oclacitinib) provides veterinarians and pet owners with a palatable, convenient solution to quickly and safely stop the cycle of pruritus in allergic dogs and clinical signs of atopic dermatitis in dogs.On the livestock side of the business, Zoetis gained approval in the U.S. for Valcor™, a broad spectrum combination endectocide for the treatment of internal and external parasites in cattle. Additionally, Zoetis enhanced its swine vaccine portfolio in the U.S. with the approval of Lawsotek™, a vaccine that helps protect healthy pigs three weeks of age or older against disease caused by the common bacterium Lawsonia intracellularis. The company also received an expanded label approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on three beef implant products. Synovex Choice®, Synovex Plus® and Synovex® One Feedlot are now approved for reimplanting programs, providing beef producers with enhanced flexibility to more broadly use these technologies to help them meet their productivity goals.In Business Development news, Zoetis completed its acquisition of Jurox, a privately held animal health company based in Australia. The acquisition brings Zoetis a range of companion animal and livestock products primed for global expansion, and provides the company with future growth opportunities, manufacturing capacity and increased capabilities in Australia, its fourth largest market based on 2021 revenue. Additionally, Basepaws, a privately held petcare genetics company acquired by Zoetis in June, recently launched a comprehensive portfolio exclusively for veterinary professionals. The portfolio consists of genetic tests that screen for 64 feline health markers and over 210 canine health markers, the business’ first entry into canine genetics.FINANCIAL GUIDANCEZoetis is lowering its full year 2022 guidance to reflect lower than expected sales due to continued supply constraints, veterinary workforce challenges, as well as the negative impact of recent changes to foreign exchange rates. This includes:Revenue between $8.000 billion to $8.075 billionReported diluted EPS between $4.51 to $4.59Adjusted diluted EPS between $4.83 to $4.90This guidance reflects foreign exchange rates as of late October. Additional details on guidance are included in the financial tables and will be discussed on the company's conference call this morning.WEBCAST &amp; CONFERENCE CALL DETAILSZoetis will host a webcast and conference call at 8:30 a.m. (ET) today, during which company executives will review third quarter 2022 results, discuss financial guidance and respond to questions from financial analysts.

Despite the importance of these measures to management in goal setting and performance measurement, non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that have no standardized meaning prescribed by U.S. GAAP and, therefore, have limits in their usefulness to investors. Because of the non-standardized definitions, non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS (unlike U.S. GAAP net income and its components and diluted EPS) may not be comparable to the calculation of similar measures of other companies. Non-GAAP adjusted net income and its components, and non-GAAP adjusted diluted EPS are presented solely to permit investors to more fully understand how management assesses performance.See Notes to Reconciliation of GAAP Reported to Non-GAAP Adjusted Information for notes (1) and (2).ZOETIS INC.RECONCILIATION OF GAAP REPORTED TO NON-GAAP ADJUSTED INFORMATIONCERTAIN LINE ITEMS(UNAUDITED)(millions of dollars, except per share data)Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022GAAPReported(a)PurchaseAccountingAdjustmentsAcquisition-RelatedCosts(1)CertainSignificantItems(2)Non-GAAPAdjusted(b)Cost of sales$1,801$(3)$—$(8)$1,790Gross profit4,2393—84,250Selling, general and administrative expenses1,495(22)——1,473Amortization of intangible assets115(95)——20Restructuring charges and certain acquisition-related costs9—(4)(5)—Other (income)/deductions–net6——39Income before provision for taxes on income2,064120410...]"

Overall, it has been a mixed earnings season so far. While some companies like Merck, Biogen, Sanofi and Gilead beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts, a few drug/biotech companies like AbbVie and Novartis reported mixed results.Some companies like Merck and Sanofi raised their sales and earnings expectations for the year while others kept their financial outlook intact as their expectations for better operational growth are likely to be offset by potentially greater currency headwinds.Per the Zacks classification, the pharma/biotech industry comes under the broader Medical sector, which comprises pharma/biotech as well as medical device companies.As of Oct 26, per the Earnings Trends report, 23.2% of the Medical sector participants, constituting 43% of the sector’s market capitalization, have already reported earnings. While 84.6% of the companies beat on earnings, 92.3% surpassed on revenues. Earnings decreased 1.8% year over year, while revenues rose 7.5%.Overall, third-quarter earnings of the Medical sector are expected to decline 8.3%, while sales are projected to increase 3.8%.Here we discuss five companies, Amgen AMGN, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN, Moderna MRNA, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Limited TEVA and Zoetis ZTS, which are set to report third-quarter results on Nov 3.AmgenThis large biotech’s performance has been strong, with earnings beating estimates in all the trailing four quarters.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings stands at $4.43 per share.Volume growth from Amgen key drugs like Prolia, Xgeva, Repatha, Otezla and Evenity, among others is expected to have been partially offset by biosimilar/generic competition for mature drugs. Third-quarter sales of Amgen’s new KRAS inhibitor, Lumakras, are likely to have been higher than $77 million recorded in the second quarterRegeneronThis biotech has an impressive track record, having beaten earnings in all the past four quarters.

Also, its share of profits/losses from partner Sanofi for their blockbuster immunology medicine, Dupixent, will be in focus. Sanofi, on its third-quarter earnings call, announced a 44.5% increase in Dupixent sales growth in the third quarter.ModernaModerna’s surprise history has been mixed, with earnings beating estimates in three of the trailing four quarters while missing the same once.

However, the impact of the pandemic continues to subside globally. It remains to be seen how this factor has affected sales of Moderna’s vaccine. However, deliveries of the bivalent BA.4/BA.5 Omicron-targeting COVID-19 vaccine, mRNA-1273.222, after FDA authorized the same in August, are expected to have boosted COVID vaccine sales.Teva Pharmaceutical IndustriesTeva’s surprise history has been mixed, with earnings beating estimates in two of the trailing four quarters, missing in one and delivering in-line results in one.

ZTS may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Zoetis is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for ZTS in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.24 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for ZTS, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.46% heading into earnings season.Zoetis Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseZoetis Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseZoetis Inc. price-eps-surprise | Zoetis Inc.

Jeffrey Smith’s Starboard Value LP is the largest position holder in the company, with 5.6 million shares worth $282.6 million. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“ON Semiconductor Corporation (NASDAQ:ON) is a global market leader in power management and image sensors. The company reported 49% gross margins in 1Q22 which met the new management team’s 48%-50% long-term target after revising it higher just one quarter ago. We believe ON has a clear path to &gt;50% gross margins, and its financial results reflect the ongoing structural improvements in both manufacturing and products, cost initiatives, product mix and rising prices. Growing demand for chips in electric vehicles, renewable energy infrastructure, advanced driver assistance (multiple cameras), factory automation and machine vision should drive sustainable high single-digit top-line growth. With shares trading at an attractive discount to our PMV estimate, we continued to move this holding up the Crop of the portfolio.”7. SolarEdge Technologies, Inc.

This article is for those who would like to learn about Return On Equity (ROE). By way of learning-by-doing, we'll look at ROE to gain a better understanding of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE).ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for NextEra Energy How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for NextEra Energy is:6.3% = US$2.9b ÷ US$47b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.06 in profit.Does NextEra Energy Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see NextEra Energy has a lower ROE than the average (9.2%) in the Electric Utilities industry classification.roeThat's not what we like to see. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books.  Our risks dashboard should have the 2 risks we have identified for NextEra Energy.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesNextEra Energy's Debt And Its 6.3% ROENextEra Energy does use a high amount of debt to increase returns. It has a debt to equity ratio of 1.39. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt does bring extra risk, so it's only really worthwhile when a company generates some decent returns from it.ConclusionReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. Companies that can achieve high returns on equity without too much debt are generally of good quality. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.Of course NextEra Energy may not be the best stock to buy.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Mid-Cap Dividend Stocks To Buy Now. Dividends have historically been an effective hedge against inflation. For example, the S&amp;P 500 declined from 120 to 62.28 in October 1974 before eventually rising again. During January 1973 to July 1984, the total return with dividends reinvested over the 14 years was approximately 400%, which equals 11.6% per year. When adjusted for CPI inflation, these returns came in at 86% or 4.3% per year in real terms. In periods of high market volatility, dividends can potentially become a much larger part of total shareholder returns. Jason Ray, CEO of Zenith Wealth Partners in Philadelphia, advised investors on October 4 to pile into dividend stocks as a value play and suggested younger traders with a long investment horizon to seek out alternative assets, including investing in early stage startups and real estate. According to Hartford Funds, dividends have played a notable role in the returns to shareholders during the last 50 years. Going back to 1960, 84% of the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index is attributed to reinvested dividends and compounding. From 1930 to 2021, dividend contribution to the total return of the S&amp;P 500 Index averaged 40%. A Ned Davis study shows that companies that deviated from their dividend policies suffered negative and volatile consequences. Some of the best mid-cap dividend stocks to consider include OneMain Holdings, Inc. (NYSE:OMF), STAG Industrial, Inc. (NYSE:STAG), and Levi Strauss &amp; Co.

But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task.By their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.However, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.Our proprietary system currently recommends NextEra Energy Partners (NEP) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.Studies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this limited partnership for clean-energy projects is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:Earnings GrowthEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. For growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is highly preferable, as it is often perceived as an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.While the historical EPS growth rate for NextEra Energy Partners is 14.8%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 190.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 40.5%.Cash Flow GrowthWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.Story continuesRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for NextEra Energy Partners is 67.3%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of 17.5%.While investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 10.8% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 4.3%.Promising Earnings Estimate RevisionsBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.The current-year earnings estimates for NextEra Energy Partners have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 4.9% over the past month.Bottom LineNextEra Energy Partners has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.This combination indicates that NextEra Energy Partners is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

News and other information about Newton is available at www.newtonim.com and via Twitter: @NewtonIM.Investors should consider the investment objectives, risks, charges and expenses of a fund carefully before investing. To obtain a prospectus, or a summary prospectus, if available, that contains this and other information about a fund, contact your financial professional or visit im.bnymellon.com. Read the prospectus carefully before investing. Main RisksEquities are subject to market, market sector, market liquidity, issuer, and investment style risks, among other factors, to varying degrees. Investing in foreign denominated and/or domiciled securities involves special risks, including changes in currency exchange rates, political, economic, and social instability, limited company information, differing auditing and legal standards, and less market liquidity. These risks generally are greater with emerging market countries. Because the fund invests significantly in companies that are engaged in the infrastructure business, the fund is more susceptible to adverse economic, regulatory, political, legal and other changes affecting such companies. Infrastructure companies are subject to a variety of factors that may adversely affect their business or operations, including high interest costs in connection with capital construction programs, costs associated with environmental and other regulations, difficulty in raising capital in adequate amounts on reasonable terms in periods of high inflation or unsettled capital markets, the effects of economic slowdown and surplus capacity, increased competition from other providers of services, uncertainties concerning the availability of fuel at reasonable prices, the effects of energy conservation policies, service interruption due to environmental, operational or other mishaps, and other factors.ETF shares are listed on an exchange, and shares are generally purchased and sold in the secondary market at market price. At times, the market price may be at a premium or discount to the ETF's per share NAV. In addition, ETFs are subject to the risk that an active trading market for an ETF's shares may not develop or be maintained. Buying or selling ETF shares on an exchange may require the payment of brokerage commissions. ETFs trade like stocks and are subject to investment risk, including possible loss of principal. The risks of investing in the ETF typically reflect the risks associated with the types of instruments in which the ETF invests. Diversification cannot assure a profit or protect against loss.ETFs will issue (or redeem) fund shares to certain institutional investors known as ""Authorized Participants"" (typically market makers or other broker-dealers) only in large blocks of fund shares known as ""Creation Units."" BNY Mellon Securities Corporation (""BNYMSC""), a subsidiary of BNY Mellon, serves as distributor of the ETF funds. BNYMSC does not distribute fund shares in less than Creation Units, nor does it maintain a secondary market in fund shares. BNYMSC may enter into selected agreements with Authorized Participants for the sale of Creation Units of fund shares.Recent market risks include pandemic risks related to COVID-19. The effects of COVID-19 have contributed to increased volatility in global markets and will likely affect certain countries, companies, industries and market sectors more dramatically than others. To the extent the fund may overweight its investments in certain countries, companies, industries or market sectors, such positions will increase the fund's exposure to risk of loss from adverse developments affecting those countries, companies, industries or sectors.Not FDIC-Insured | No Bank Guarantee | May Lose Value© 2022 BNY Mellon Securities Corporation, distributor, 240 Greenwich Street, 9th Floor, New York, NY 10286Media ContactSue WattU.S. Communications ManagerSue.Watt@bnymellon.com +1 212-815-37571 AUM as of September 30, 2022, includes $34.6 billion AUM attributable to an entity which is no longer an affiliate of BNY Mellon as of November 1, 2022.2 There is no assurance and certainty that the fund will achieve such targeted yield or any particular level of yield.

The newly published 2023 Technology, Media and Telecommunications (TMT) Industry Outlook is part of S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's Big Picture 2023 Outlook Report Series.S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence Outlook Projects AR and VR Installed Base to Reach Nearly 74 Million by 2026 as Game Technology Illustrates Promise of MetaverseThe new report highlighted implications of the metaverse in gaming and the enterprise, datacenter sustainability amid a worsening energy crisis, and the rise of fintech as a service. The report also explores video streaming competition and broadband transformation as forces of disruption in 2023. ""The foundational shift of the global economy to a digital footing—a shift that has been underway for over a decade and accelerated during the pandemic—continues. This is creating enormous opportunities for new value creation and disruption,"" said Eric Hanselman, Chief Research Analyst for TMT at S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.Key highlights from the report include:AR and VR device adoption will grow steadily over the next five years as big tech companies underline the hardware's potential as a conduit to the metaverse. As of the end of 2021, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence estimates there were 28.5 million AR/VR headsets installed worldwide across consumer and commercial settings, and forecasts that base to grow to 73.6 million by 2026.The global energy crisis may push datacenter operators to test and install new equipment more quickly than expected. While hyperscale datacenters attract attention because they are so large, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's models show that cloud deployments can be up to 80% more efficient than typical enterprise IT deployments.The fintech as a service sector is rapidly attracting venture capital, with private startups in this sector raising more than $5 billion since the start of 2021.Rising inflation and cost of living crises may force some consumers to pare back streaming subscriptions, which in turn could prompt the pack chasing Netflix and Disney to focus on profitability instead of scale.By 2030, global pay TV penetration is predicted to slip to 51.2% of residential households, from 57.7% in 2021. Moreover, the number of fixed broadband subscribers globally is forecast to hit 1.13 billion by 2023, exceeding the 1.09 billion traditional pay TV subscribers for the first time.Story continuesTo request a copy of the 2023 Technology, Media &amp; Telecommunications Industry Outlook, please contact pressinquiries.mi@spglobal.com.S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence's opinions, quotes, and credit-related and other analyses are statements of opinion as of the date they are expressed and not statements of fact or recommendation to purchase, hold, or sell any securities or to make any investment decisions, and do not address the suitability of any security.About S&amp;P Global Market IntelligenceAt S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, we understand the importance of accurate, deep and insightful information.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Dividend Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks By Hedge Funds. High bond yields have been a positive addition to the portfolios of income investors after years of nominal fixed-income returns. However, dividend stocks still provide essential balance and additional income to an asset portfolio, and they help combat the high inflation effectively. Jenny Harrington, CEO of Gilman Hill Asset Management, told Barron’s on October 29:“You need capital appreciation of the share price and growth of the dividend in an inflationary environment.”Dividend stocks have comparatively outperformed in the market selloff this year. Dividend-paying entities in the S&amp;P 500 have dropped 11%, compared to the 19% decline in the S&amp;P 500 benchmark and the 23% drop in non-dividend stocks so far this year. Income stocks are attractive amid market volatility since they protect investors against plummeting share prices. Stephanie Link, the chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors, advised investors to focus on dividend growth prospects rather than high yields alone. She further said:“If companies are going to continue to increase their dividends, then I feel good about them.”Similarly, David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Advisors, noted that although Treasury yield has risen which means that bond payout is attractive at about 4%, dividend stocks provide the potential for increasing payouts while bond payments remain fixed. Some of the best entities for a dividend stock portfolio include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology We selected the following dividend stocks based on their popularity among elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022. We have also mentioned the latest analyst coverage, underlying business fundamentals, and recent dividend payouts by the companies for additional context for readers. The dividend yields are mentioned as of November 2. Story continuesDividend Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks By Hedge FundsPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashDividend Stock Portfolio: Top Stock Picks By Hedge Funds10. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Dividend Yield as of November 2: 1.08%S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is a New York-based provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, data analytics, and workflow solutions in the global capital and commodity markets. The company operates through six divisions – S&amp;P Global Ratings, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, S&amp;P Global Mobility, and S&amp;P Global Engineering Solutions. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) declared on September 28 a $0.85 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 12, to shareholders of record on November 18. As of October 27, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) has completed $11 billion of its $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program year-to-date, and it expects to launch the remaining $1 billion of the authorized repurchase units in December.Argus analyst John Eade on November 1 maintained a Buy recommendation on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) but lowered the price target on the shares to $365 from $420. The company has almost concluded a multi-year restructuring and is now focused on its rapidly growing financial businesses, including the lucrative and not very competitive business of rating bonds, the analyst told investors in a research note. The analyst also added that he believes S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) management can pull through the tough inflation and high interest rate environment.According to Insider Monkey’s database, 84 hedge funds were bullish on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) at the end of June 2022, compared to 97 funds in the prior quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 8.76 million shares worth nearly $3 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is one of the top picks of elite investors for a dividend stock portfolio. Here is what Baron Durable Advantage Fund has to say about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”9. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Dividend Yield as of November 2: 0.12%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the American multinational technology and semiconductor firm, is one of the most popular picks of hedge funds for a dividend stock portfolio. At the end of October, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock gained as investors turned their attention towards the semiconductor industry in the midst of the Intel and Mobileye spin-off. On October 24, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis maintained an Overweight rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but lowered the price target on the shares to $140 from $190. The analyst is ""actively looking for a bottom to get more positive"" on the semiconductor sector and sees it closer in some end markets than others, but still believes ""it is too early to pull the trigger across the board."" According to Insider Monkey’s data, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was part of 84 hedge fund portfolios at the end of June 2022, compared to 102 in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 7.6 million shares worth $1.15 billion.  Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below.During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”8. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Dividend Yield as of November 2: 1.20%UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) operates as a diversified health care company in the United States. The company specializes in health insurance, Medicaid plans, and healthcare programs. On October 14, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $5.79 and a revenue of $80.9 billion, outperforming market estimates by $0.35 and $360 million, respectively. There was a double digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare segments. The company raised its full-year 2022 net earnings outlook to $20.85 to $21.05 per share and adjusted net earnings to $21.85 to $22.05 per share, versus a consensus of $21.89 and prior view of $21.4 to $21.9. On October 18, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill raised the price target on UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) to $615 from $569 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The company reported robust Q3 results as membership growth remains resilient and value-based arrangements continue to expand, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 91 hedge funds were long UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) at the end of June 2022, compared to 103 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the largest position holder in the company, with 3.11 million shares worth $1.60 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Carillon Tower Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and United Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported solid quarterly results and raised 2022 guidance modestly. Additionally, managed care is another industry that is viewed as defensive in the current environment, which helped support UnitedHealth and its peer group.”7. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 93Dividend Yield as of November 2: 0.24%Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is a Massachusetts-based provider of life sciences solutions, analytical instruments, specialty diagnostics, and laboratory products and services worldwide. As per elite hedge funds, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is one of the premier picks for a dividend stock portfolio. On October 31, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) announced that it is acquiring the UK-based diagnostic products maker, The Binding Site, for $2.6 billion from private equity firm Nordic Capital in an all-cash transaction. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) also said that throughout Q4, it expects to execute a $1 billion share buyback program, bringing the total capital spent on buybacks in 2022 to $3 billion.Baird analyst Catherine Ramsey Schulte on November 1 reiterated an Outperform rating on Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) but lowered the price target on the shares to $665 from $695. The analyst noted that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)’s Specialty Diagnostics segment typically gets the least investor attention and interest, but she forecasts the deal to be accretive to both overall revenue growth and margins. She also updated her model to factor in the acquisition, Q4 and full-year buyback assumptions, and 2023 forex headwinds.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 93 hedge funds were bullish on Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) at the end of June 2022, compared to 101 funds in the prior quarter. Thomas Steyer’s Farallon Capital is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.2 million shares worth $675 million. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is the world’s largest life sciences tools company. Shares fell due to the rotation out of life sciences tools stocks, driven by concerns about a possible global recession, foreign currency exposure, COVID-related lockdowns in China, and reduced levels of biotechnology funding. We continue to believe Thermo Fisher has a strong long-term growth outlook given a large and growing addressable market coupled with its industry-leading scale, commercial infrastructure, e-commerce platform, supply-chain capabilities, and R&amp;D investment.”6. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Dividend Yield as of November 2: 2.42%Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is an American multinational company that provides banking and financial products and services. The bank operates through Consumer Banking, Global Wealth &amp; Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets segments. On October 17, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) reported earnings for the third quarter of 2022, announcing earnings per share of $0.81 and a revenue of $24.50 billion, topping market estimates by $0.04 and $1.05 billion, respectively. On October 19, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 30, to shareholders of record on December 2. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) delivers a dividend yield of 2.42% as of November 2. BMO Capital analyst James Fotheringham raised the price target on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) on October 18 to $42 from $41 but kept a Market Perform rating on the shares. The analyst cited Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)’s ""impressive"" Q3 top-line beat and ""meaningful"" operating leverage as its pre-provision net revenue grew 24% compared to Q2 2022. However, the analyst added that it remains too early to purchase bank stocks, and he believes that Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stock will struggle until the economic backdrop stabilizes.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 99 funds were bullish on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) at the end of Q2 2022, with collective stakes worth $36 billion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with more than 1 billion shares worth $31.4 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is one of the premier stocks to consider for a robust dividend stock portfolio. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We made only one new purchase during the quarter, initiating a position in Bank of America (BAC). As one of America’s largest banks, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is second only to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in size and is probably its closest peer. Both are well-run banks, but compared to JPM, since the GFC, BAC has retired more shares, grown EPS faster and currently has more capital and a lower dividend payout. We are attracted to BAC’s strong capital base, high capital generation capacity, large loan loss reserve, low (~50%) loan/deposit ratio, short duration investment securities book, and low dividend payout that provides financial flexibility. BAC has a less volatile earnings stream than JPM with lower capital market sensitive exposures. Additionally, BAC is rigorously stress tested by the Fed every year in quantitative and qualitative fashion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which we hold in the portfolio, owns 12% of BAC. He petitioned the Fed to own more than 10%, so he clearly likes it. Bank stocks were strong gainers in 2021 on the prospects of higher rates boosting net interest margins, but the stocks pulled back in the first half of 2022 on economic concerns. We believe BAC has massive scale advantages, should benefit from increasing interest rates, particularly in the 2-year part of the yield curve, and should grow over time with the economy. The economic environment is highly uncertain, but current consensus includes the provision for losses more than doubling and capital markets activity slowing. Against that backdrop, our purchase price equated to about 8.5X our estimates of “mid-cycle” earnings. With leading businesses, a double-digit ROE, a prudent capital return strategy and a strong balance sheet, we believe this entry point offers a solid long-term value.” Click to continue reading and see Dividend Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks By Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Infrastructure Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Bank Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Dividend Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks By Hedge Funds. High bond yields have been a positive addition to the portfolios of income investors after years of nominal fixed-income returns. However, dividend stocks still provide essential balance and additional income to an asset portfolio, and they help combat the high inflation effectively. Jenny Harrington, CEO of Gilman Hill Asset Management, told Barron’s on October 29:“You need capital appreciation of the share price and growth of the dividend in an inflationary environment.”Dividend stocks have comparatively outperformed in the market selloff this year. Dividend-paying entities in the S&amp;P 500 have dropped 11%, compared to the 19% decline in the S&amp;P 500 benchmark and the 23% drop in non-dividend stocks so far this year. Income stocks are attractive amid market volatility since they protect investors against plummeting share prices. Stephanie Link, the chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors, advised investors to focus on dividend growth prospects rather than high yields alone. She further said:“If companies are going to continue to increase their dividends, then I feel good about them.”Similarly, David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Advisors, noted that although Treasury yield has risen which means that bond payout is attractive at about 4%, dividend stocks provide the potential for increasing payouts while bond payments remain fixed. Some of the best entities for a dividend stock portfolio include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology We selected the following dividend stocks based on their popularity among elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022. We have also mentioned the latest analyst coverage, underlying business fundamentals, and recent dividend payouts by the companies for additional context for readers. The dividend yields are mentioned as of November 2. Story continuesDividend Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks By Hedge FundsPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashDividend Stock Portfolio: Top Stock Picks By Hedge Funds10. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Dividend Yield as of November 2: 1.08%S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is a New York-based provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, data analytics, and workflow solutions in the global capital and commodity markets. The company operates through six divisions – S&amp;P Global Ratings, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, S&amp;P Global Mobility, and S&amp;P Global Engineering Solutions. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) declared on September 28 a $0.85 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 12, to shareholders of record on November 18. As of October 27, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) has completed $11 billion of its $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program year-to-date, and it expects to launch the remaining $1 billion of the authorized repurchase units in December.Argus analyst John Eade on November 1 maintained a Buy recommendation on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) but lowered the price target on the shares to $365 from $420. The company has almost concluded a multi-year restructuring and is now focused on its rapidly growing financial businesses, including the lucrative and not very competitive business of rating bonds, the analyst told investors in a research note. The analyst also added that he believes S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) management can pull through the tough inflation and high interest rate environment.According to Insider Monkey’s database, 84 hedge funds were bullish on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) at the end of June 2022, compared to 97 funds in the prior quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 8.76 million shares worth nearly $3 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is one of the top picks of elite investors for a dividend stock portfolio. Here is what Baron Durable Advantage Fund has to say about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”9. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Dividend Yield as of November 2: 0.12%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the American multinational technology and semiconductor firm, is one of the most popular picks of hedge funds for a dividend stock portfolio. At the end of October, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock gained as investors turned their attention towards the semiconductor industry in the midst of the Intel and Mobileye spin-off. On October 24, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis maintained an Overweight rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but lowered the price target on the shares to $140 from $190. The analyst is ""actively looking for a bottom to get more positive"" on the semiconductor sector and sees it closer in some end markets than others, but still believes ""it is too early to pull the trigger across the board."" According to Insider Monkey’s data, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was part of 84 hedge fund portfolios at the end of June 2022, compared to 102 in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 7.6 million shares worth $1.15 billion.  Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below.During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”8. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Dividend Yield as of November 2: 1.20%UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) operates as a diversified health care company in the United States. The company specializes in health insurance, Medicaid plans, and healthcare programs. On October 14, UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPS of $5.79 and a revenue of $80.9 billion, outperforming market estimates by $0.35 and $360 million, respectively. There was a double digit growth at both Optum and UnitedHealthcare segments. The company raised its full-year 2022 net earnings outlook to $20.85 to $21.05 per share and adjusted net earnings to $21.85 to $22.05 per share, versus a consensus of $21.89 and prior view of $21.4 to $21.9. On October 18, Deutsche Bank analyst George Hill raised the price target on UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) to $615 from $569 and maintained a Buy rating on the shares. The company reported robust Q3 results as membership growth remains resilient and value-based arrangements continue to expand, the analyst told investors in a research note.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 91 hedge funds were long UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) at the end of June 2022, compared to 103 funds in the prior quarter. Rajiv Jain’s GQG Partners is the largest position holder in the company, with 3.11 million shares worth $1.60 billion. In its Q2 2022 investor letter, Carillon Tower Advisers, an asset management firm, highlighted a few stocks and United Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) was one of them. Here is what the fund said:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported solid quarterly results and raised 2022 guidance modestly. Additionally, managed care is another industry that is viewed as defensive in the current environment, which helped support UnitedHealth and its peer group.”7. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 93Dividend Yield as of November 2: 0.24%Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is a Massachusetts-based provider of life sciences solutions, analytical instruments, specialty diagnostics, and laboratory products and services worldwide. As per elite hedge funds, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is one of the premier picks for a dividend stock portfolio. On October 31, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) announced that it is acquiring the UK-based diagnostic products maker, The Binding Site, for $2.6 billion from private equity firm Nordic Capital in an all-cash transaction. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) also said that throughout Q4, it expects to execute a $1 billion share buyback program, bringing the total capital spent on buybacks in 2022 to $3 billion.Baird analyst Catherine Ramsey Schulte on November 1 reiterated an Outperform rating on Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) but lowered the price target on the shares to $665 from $695. The analyst noted that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)’s Specialty Diagnostics segment typically gets the least investor attention and interest, but she forecasts the deal to be accretive to both overall revenue growth and margins. She also updated her model to factor in the acquisition, Q4 and full-year buyback assumptions, and 2023 forex headwinds.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 93 hedge funds were bullish on Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) at the end of June 2022, compared to 101 funds in the prior quarter. Thomas Steyer’s Farallon Capital is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.2 million shares worth $675 million. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is the world’s largest life sciences tools company. Shares fell due to the rotation out of life sciences tools stocks, driven by concerns about a possible global recession, foreign currency exposure, COVID-related lockdowns in China, and reduced levels of biotechnology funding. We continue to believe Thermo Fisher has a strong long-term growth outlook given a large and growing addressable market coupled with its industry-leading scale, commercial infrastructure, e-commerce platform, supply-chain capabilities, and R&amp;D investment.”6. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Dividend Yield as of November 2: 2.42%Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is an American multinational company that provides banking and financial products and services. The bank operates through Consumer Banking, Global Wealth &amp; Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets segments. On October 17, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) reported earnings for the third quarter of 2022, announcing earnings per share of $0.81 and a revenue of $24.50 billion, topping market estimates by $0.04 and $1.05 billion, respectively. On October 19, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 30, to shareholders of record on December 2. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) delivers a dividend yield of 2.42% as of November 2. BMO Capital analyst James Fotheringham raised the price target on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) on October 18 to $42 from $41 but kept a Market Perform rating on the shares. The analyst cited Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)’s ""impressive"" Q3 top-line beat and ""meaningful"" operating leverage as its pre-provision net revenue grew 24% compared to Q2 2022. However, the analyst added that it remains too early to purchase bank stocks, and he believes that Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stock will struggle until the economic backdrop stabilizes.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 99 funds were bullish on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) at the end of Q2 2022, with collective stakes worth $36 billion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with more than 1 billion shares worth $31.4 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is one of the premier stocks to consider for a robust dividend stock portfolio. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We made only one new purchase during the quarter, initiating a position in Bank of America (BAC). As one of America’s largest banks, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is second only to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in size and is probably its closest peer. Both are well-run banks, but compared to JPM, since the GFC, BAC has retired more shares, grown EPS faster and currently has more capital and a lower dividend payout. We are attracted to BAC’s strong capital base, high capital generation capacity, large loan loss reserve, low (~50%) loan/deposit ratio, short duration investment securities book, and low dividend payout that provides financial flexibility. BAC has a less volatile earnings stream than JPM with lower capital market sensitive exposures. Additionally, BAC is rigorously stress tested by the Fed every year in quantitative and qualitative fashion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which we hold in the portfolio, owns 12% of BAC. He petitioned the Fed to own more than 10%, so he clearly likes it. Bank stocks were strong gainers in 2021 on the prospects of higher rates boosting net interest margins, but the stocks pulled back in the first half of 2022 on economic concerns. We believe BAC has massive scale advantages, should benefit from increasing interest rates, particularly in the 2-year part of the yield curve, and should grow over time with the economy. The economic environment is highly uncertain, but current consensus includes the provision for losses more than doubling and capital markets activity slowing. Against that backdrop, our purchase price equated to about 8.5X our estimates of “mid-cycle” earnings. With leading businesses, a double-digit ROE, a prudent capital return strategy and a strong balance sheet, we believe this entry point offers a solid long-term value.” Click to continue reading and see Dividend Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks By Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Infrastructure Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Bank Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

197,cbba8e73-f3cc-3bc2-b745-8cb4bc1640ce,MA,2022-11-03,"With 88% institutional ownership, Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) is a favorite amongst the big guns",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/88-institutional-ownership-mastercard-incorporated-120035726.html,1667476835,STORY,['MA'],"[To get a sense of who is truly in control of Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 88% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Mastercard. Check out our latest analysis for Mastercard ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Mastercard?Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.Mastercard already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Mastercard, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Mastercard. The MasterCard Foundation, Endowment Arm is currently the largest shareholder, with 11% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 8.0% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.7% of the company stock.Story continuesA closer look at our ownership figures suggests that the top 20 shareholders have a combined ownership of 50% implying that no single shareholder has a majority.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of MastercardWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our information suggests that Mastercard Incorporated insiders own under 1% of the company. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$315m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 12% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Consider risks, for instance. Every company has them, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Mastercard   you should know about.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The prospect of a more forceful regulatory regime comes after various trading platforms, such as Celsius, blew up earlier this year.NEW YORK, UNITED STATES - 2022/02/17: Mastercard CEO Michael Miebach attends a roundtable with U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai and NYC leaders for Small Business at NYC headquarters.

Take a listen.MICHAEL MIEBACH: Well, you're not talking to the economic oracle, so I don't really know what is going to happen in the future. What I can tell you is through the lens of our business, and we do see a good chunk of consumer spending and of business spending, is that there is inflation in the numbers, so prices have gone up. But we also see this as the more interesting story that I think is that consumers continue to spend.There is a resilience in consumer spending in pretty much every part of the world. There is changes, though, in what people spend on. We just talked about the shift to the services economy. But depending on different segments within the spectrum of consumers, there is more shift to maybe necessities or less discretionary spend. So you spend more on food versus back to travel.BRIAN SOZZI: Yeah.MICHAEL MIEBACH: You know, that is at different ends of the spectrum. That could be-- is a trend that we're seeing. So the ""what,"" somewhat changing. The absolute level, not changing. We see that in Europe. We see it in the United States. We see it really in every part of the worldBRIAN SOZZI: Do you think that momentum continues into the holidays?MICHAEL MIEBACH: Yup. Again, back to predictions, how to see where it's going to go. So far, we don't see any near-term changes in consumer overall spending levels. The continuation of these shifts into experiences vis-a-vis goods, I think that will continue.BRIAN SOZZI: Are you confident in saying that we're just not going to have a recession? You don't see any red flags in your numbers that would give you--MICHAEL MIEBACH: We--Story continuesBRIAN SOZZI: --consumer pause?MICHAEL MIEBACH: --currently, based on the data that we have, which is all past, it already happened, there is no such indication. Consumer is resilience. That resilience will last-- last to-- we have not any indication that there's a near-term recession. So we said, well, certainly we don't see it this year, but who knows? It's too early to talk about 2023.BRIAN SOZZI: What will Mastercard's role be in the future of crypto?MICHAEL MIEBACH: You know, Brian, earlier, we were saying whatever choices people take in payments. So some people want to invest in crypto assets, for example, so buy any cryptocurrency. And we want to make that as easy and, more importantly, as safe as any other payment that people affect with Mastercard.So buy a good, and it's not really living up to what it is, you can basically reverse that, chargeback that particular payment. And when it comes to crypto, same expectations and aspirations on safety, security, regulatory compliance. We want to make it easy, and we want to make it safe. And that's how we have been engaging whole set of partnerships with crypto exchanges.So I can buy crypto easily through my card, and I can pay out from my crypto world using a Mastercard Send solution, which is basically a push payment back into my card or wherever it goes, so making that very straightforward. You look at other aspects of the crypto economy, the overall question of where's regulation going, regulatory compliance, and things like that, we have a whole set of services that we deploy to make the ecosystem safe. So exchanges, banks, and everybody else who wants to play in the space, in the end, they all have needs that are pretty common on safety, security, so we fulfill those.And finally, there's a lot of talk out there on central bank digital currencies, which is yet another angle of the crypto economy where we advise and work with governments, and we provide testing facilities. You want to create the digital sand dollar. The government of the Bahamas has done that, and they partner with us to try it out and see how that works.So we covered a whole spectrum of the crypto economy. Really, from the simple starting point, it's a good-- it's an interesting technology. People have interested-- have interest in that. There's problems to solve. Payments isn't as efficient as it could be everywhere in the world.BRIAN SOZZI: I have this full interview with Michael now on the Yahoo Finance home page with the nifty 350-word article that I wrote up. But also worth noting as well-- not in this particular clip-- he said they're already in the buy now, pay later space. And he said it pretty matter of fact, which got me wondering, well, what does that mean for a firm in Klarna if a company like Mastercard is in here and perhaps going to get in here even more?BRAD SMITH: What's that mean for a Block and an Afterpay, who are also looking at more consumers leaning into the ability to pay in different segments for a purchase that they can make today instantly? And, you know, where does that even kind of have a bigger type of role in the broader kind of credit annexation that consumers have right now, especially going into the holiday season?JULIE HYMAN: Well, and even more broadly beyond buy now, pay later, a lot of the giant legacy financial firms are already fintech, so to speak. They're in a lot of those same businesses--BRAD SMITH: Yeah.JULIE HYMAN: --right? Maybe they're not as small and nimble. Maybe they're not as known by the public for doing that. Most of them do it. But I don't know what that means for the sort of longer-term competitive landscape.BRIAN SOZZI: But by and large, American Express, Mastercard, very good quarters, not just in the US, even overseas too as well.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Expedia (EXPE) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $3.93 a share, just one day from its upcoming earnings release on November 3, 2022.Expedia's Earnings ESP sits at 0.93%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $3.93 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.89.EXPE is part of a big group of Retail-Wholesale stocks that boast a positive ESP, and investors may want to take a look at CarMax (KMX) as well.CarMax is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on December 28, 2022. KMX's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.85 a share 56 days from its next earnings release.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CarMax is $0.78, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 7.95%.Story continuesEXPE and KMX's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

This would give Army commanders and aviators greater flexibility in how and when aircraft and pilots are used, especially in limited visibility or contested environments.See demonstration photos and video.Why It MattersSikorsky is partnered with DARPA to develop autonomy technology that will exponentially improve the flight safety and efficiency of rotary and fixed-wing aircraft. Sikorsky's autonomy system, known as MATRIX™ technology, forms the core of DARPA's ALIAS (Aircrew Labor In-cockpit Automation System) project.""We believe MATRIX technology is ready now for transition to the Army as they look to modernize the enduring helicopter fleet, and acquire Future Vertical Lift aircraft,"" said Igor Cherepinsky, director of Sikorsky Innovations. ""In addition to increasing flight safety and reliability, MATRIX technology enables survivability in high tempo, high threat 21st Century Security environments where Black Hawk helicopters operate today, and DEFIANT X® and RAIDER X® helicopters could operate in the future. Uncrewed or reduced crewed helicopters could safely perform critical and lifesaving missions day or night in complex terrain and in contested battlespace.""Story continuesThe Yuma DetailsDuring PC22 Technology Gateway, the Sikorsky and DARPA team showed how the optionally piloted Black Hawk helicopter with no humans on board can deliver a large quantity of blood product unharmed by flying low and fast above ground level using the terrain to mask its signature; resupply troops with an external load; and re-route mid-flight to evacuate a casualty.To begin the flight demonstrations, pilots flew and landed the Black Hawk aircraft, then activated the MATRIX system to give full control to the flight computer. When the pilots exited, the helicopter autonomously completed the following mission demonstrations:Long-endurance Medical Resupply: The Black Hawk aircraft flew 83 miles while loaded with 400 units of real and simulated blood – totaling 500 pounds. On reaching 40 miles from its initial take-off point, the helicopter descended into a valley as low as 200 feet above ground level at 100 knots.Cargo Delivery and Casualty Evacuation (combined mission): The helicopter lifted off with a 2,600-pound external load attached to a 40-foot sling, and flew at 100 knots for 30 minutes toward a designated landing zone. While in flight, the helicopter was redirected, simulating a scenario in which a threat needed to be neutralized near the primary landing site. Sikorsky demonstrated how a ground operator with a secure radio and tablet can take control of the uncrewed helicopter, command it to release its sling load, and then land to evacuate a casualty from a nearby location. Once the manikin on a litter was secured inside the cabin, the ground operator launched the aircraft. During the return flight, a BATDOK health monitoring device integrated with the helicopter's communications system relayed the patient's vitals in real-time to a ground-based medical team. What's NextThe PC22 demonstrations were the second set of uninhabited Black Hawk flights this year. Sikorsky and DARPA will continue to work toward the transition of this technology for military operations, such as aircrew support and operations, logistics and medical resupply, casualty evacuation, and commercial applications such as firefighting, cargo and urban air mobility.For more information visit, www.lockheedmartin.com/matrix.About Lockheed MartinHeadquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin Corporation is a global security and aerospace company that employs approximately 114,000 people worldwide and is principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services.Please follow @LMNews on Twitter for the latest announcements and news across the corporation. Sikorsky demonstrates to the U.S. Army for the first time how an optionally piloted Black Hawk helicopter flying in autonomous mode could resupply forward forces.

216,30f767af-5474-3707-bd50-988cf80e2dee,JNJ,2022-11-03,"GSK's Q3 Earnings Beat, Ups 2022 Sales Outlook, Stock Up",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/gsks-q3-earnings-beat-ups-170305160.html,1667408585,STORY,"['GSK', 'HLN', 'JNJ', 'PFE']","[GSK plc GSK reported third-quarter 2022 adjusted earnings of $1.09 per American depositary share (“ADS”), beating both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of 90 cents and 85 cents, respectively. Adjusted earnings improved 25% year over year on a reported basis and 11% at a constant exchange rate (“CER”).Quarterly revenues increased 18% on a reported basis and 9% at CER to $9.2 billion (£7.8 billion), beating both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $7.8 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively. The upside can be attributed to a rise in sales across all business segments and additional sales from its COVID-19 antibody drug, Xevudy.In July, GSK completed the spin-off of its consumer healthcare segment into a new standalone company called Haleon HLN. From second-quarter 2022 onward, GSK’s commercial operations constitute only the BioPharma business. Management now reports financial figures under three segments: Specialty Medicines, Vaccines and General Medicines.Prior to the demerger, Haleon was a joint venture between GSK and Pfizer PFE. Pfizer holds a 32% stake in Haleon and GSK holds a 6% stake. A 54.5% stake in Haleon is held by GSK’s shareholders. Pfizer intends to sell its overall stake in Haleon.BioPharma Business Remains StrongFollowing the demerger of the consumer healthcare business, the BioPharma business includes all medicines and vaccines, including Xevudy, in GSK’s portfolio. Sales were up across all segments under the BioPharma business, especially Specialty Medicines.Sales from commercial operations were driven by continued sales growth across all segments, especially strong sales of Shingrix, Trelegy and additional Xevudy sales. Excluding sales from Xevudy, total BioPharma sales were up 7% at CER.Sales in the United States were up 2%. Sales in European and International markets gained 11% and 20%, respectively, at CER.Sales of the Specialty Medicines segment surged 24% at CER, driven by consistent growth across all therapy areas. Revenues from the Specialty Medicines segment were up 11% at CER, excluding Xevudy sales. Sales growth of HIV, oncology and respiratory drugs was strong.Story continuesXevudy generated sales of £411 million in the third quarter, compared with £466 million in the second quarter. Xevudy sales contributed 13 percentage points at CER to the Specialty Medicines segment growth. However, the drug negatively impacted adjusted margins due to its higher cost of sales. More than 90% of the drug’s sales were generated from International markets. GSK markets Xevudy in collaboration with Vir Biotechnology.HIV sales increased 7% at CER. Sales growth of new HIV drugs — Juluca, Dovato, Cabenuva, Rukobia and Arpetude — and favorable pricing mix in the United States were partially offset by weaker sales of Triumeq and Tivicay. It is worth mentioning that GSK markets Juluca in collaboration with J&amp;J JNJ.GSK generates the majority of its HIV sales from its dolutegravir franchise, comprising three-drug regimens — Triumeq and Tivicay — and two-drug regimens — Dovato and J&amp;J-partnered Juluca. The launch of the two-drug regimens has been eroding sales and market share of the three-drug regimens following their launch. During the third quarter, GSK and J&amp;J’s Juluca and Dovato generated nearly 35% of total HIV sales, up from 33% in the year-ago quarter.Sales of the dolutegravir franchise were up 1% at CER in the U.S. market and 8% in Europe. In International markets, sales were down 18% at CER.Sales of Triumeq declined 16% at CER, while Tivicay sales fell 13% at CER. The combined sales of Dovato and J&amp;J-partnered Juluca gained 40% at CER. Sales of Rukobia, Cabenuva and Apretude also contributed to growth. Overall, the new HIV drugs gained 64% at CER.Sales of the immuno-inflammation drug, Benlysta, were up 15% in the quarter, reflecting growth across all regions.Sales of the respiratory drug, Nucala, were up 18% at CER during the quarter, driven by growth in all markets.Oncology sales were up 19% year over year, mainly driven by Zejula. Sales of Zejula rose 11% in the quarter. Sales of the drug, Blenrep, gained 32% during the quarter. The recently-launched Jemperli added £8 million to the top line in the third quarter.Sales of General Medicines were up 1%. Loss of sales from established drugs due to generic competition was offset by the strong sales growth of respiratory drugs Trelegy Ellipta and Revlar/Breo Ellipta and the post-pandemic recovery of Augmentin sales. A few established drugs like Avamys and Flixotide also demonstrated sales growth.Trelegy Ellipta sales surged 28% year over year, driven by strong growth in all regions. Sales of Anoro Ellipta declined 8% at CER during the third quarter. Key established drugs Advair/Seretide sales declined 23% year over year due to generic competition in all markets. Sales on Revlar/Breo Ellipta were up 11% at CER year over year.Vaccine Sales RiseGSK’s third-quarter vaccine sales gained 5% at CER, mainly driven by the recovery in Shingrix sales.Shingrix sales rose 36% at CER during the quarter due to strong demand in Europe and International markets. Presently, the vaccine is available across 25 countries.In Meningitis vaccines, Bexsero sales were up 15%, while sales of Menveo rose 14%. Sales of the influenza vaccine, Fluarix, decline 7% at CER. Sales of Established vaccines were down 2% year over year.Operating ExpensesAdjusted selling, general and administration (SG&amp;A) costs increased 12% year over year at CER to £1.97 billion. The increase in SG&amp;A costs was due to the launch of products in the Specialty Medicines and Vaccines segments.Research and development (R&amp;D) expenses rose 8% year over year at CER to reach £1.3 billion due to continued investment by the company in mRNA technology and recently acquired Affinivax.2022 GuidanceGSK raised its guidance for 2022. The company expects sales to increase 8% to 10% in 2022, up from the previously guided range of 6% to 8%. The guidance excludes any revenues from its COVID-related products. Management also expects a declining trend in sales of COVID-related products.Shares of GSK moved up 2% in pre-market trading on Nov 2, likely due to the increased guidance for sales. GSK’s shares have lost 39.3% so far this year compared to the industry’s 21.9% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGSK expects sales of specialty drugs to increase low double-digit percentage at CER in 2022, while vaccine sales are expected to grow in the mid to high-teens percentage at CER for this year. The company expects strong double-digit growth for Shingrix in 2022. GSK expects broadly flat year-over-year sales growth for the General Medicines segment due to increased generic erosion of respiratory drugs.The company expects operating profit growth to now increase between 15% to 17% at CER, up from the previous guidance of 13-15%. The company continued to maintain its guidance for adjusted EPS, which is anticipated to grow around 1% lower than operating profits.For the fourth quarter, management expects to record stronger sales growth and incur higher R&amp;D expenses.GSK PLC Sponsored ADR Price GSK PLC Sponsored ADR PriceGSK PLC Sponsored ADR price | GSK PLC Sponsored ADR Quote Zacks RankGSK currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

217,cceb3ce5-55fb-33b0-9507-984c97e9395f,JNJ,2022-11-03,3 Stocks That Popped Yesterday,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-stocks-popped-yesterday-124512480.html,1667393112,STORY,"['UBER', 'CVNA', 'JNJ', 'ABMD']","[We’re in the middle of earnings season, so it would be natural to assume that earnings reports are the biggest drivers of stocks during the season. But that isn’t the case with a bunch that soared yesterday, at least not for all of them.First among them is the maker of the Impella heart pump Abiomed, Inc. ABMD, which is being acquired by Johnson &amp; Johnson JNJ. The stock soared nearly 50% on the news to $377.82, close to the offer price of $380 a share (total consideration $16.7 billion). Additionally, stock holders get to make another cool $35 a share if certain sales and development milestones are reached.The solid premium that Johnson &amp; Johnson is offering is a great exit for Abiomed shareholders and says something about JNJ’s medical technology ambitions. Abiomed also reported quarterly results, posting a 23.8% EPS beat on revenues that missed by 2.7% (impacted by currency, as nearly a fifth of revenue is generated overseas).  Impella adoption continues to increase.Next, we move to Carvana Co. CVNA, which jumped nearly 13% on a JP Morgan upgrade that was more conciliatory than actual optimism. The main point to note was that Carvana has sufficient assets (even a slice of its $2 billion in real estate can tide over this difficult patch). Therefore, it wouldn’t need to go bankrupt as some were expecting.However, this online retailer of used cars is in deep water because of increasing inventories, decreasing prices and a more cautious buyer given the level of inflation. The increase in borrowing costs also isn’t helping. The analysts warned that Carvana wasn’t “out of the woods.” The company has yet to make a profit. While the estimated per share loss for 2023 is lower than this year, it has increased in the last 7 days. It is slated to report tomorrow, so there could be further volatility in the shares. The stock dropped sharply when the pandemic hit but then picked up in a V-shaped recovery, staying stable through most of 2021, as social distancing had more people buying cars. But they’re down 95% over the past year, as supply chain concerns and inflation took a toll.Story continuesShares of Uber Technologies, Inc. UBER gained nearly 13% after the company reported encouraging commentary.Earnings missed estimates by a mile and then some while revenues were just around 3% ahead. Granted, the bar was set rather high given that revenues represented a 72% jump from last year. The increase in per share losses from 23 cents to 61 cents was attributed partly to its equity in Didi.But management commentary sent the shares soaring. For one thing, ridership continued to increase, exceeding pre-pandemic levels, which means that while consumers are avoiding buying stuff, eating out and traveling remain relatively high on their priority lists, after the drought of the last two years. This must be music to investors’ ears. Second, it isn’t just that riders are getting back in droves, but its efforts to lure drivers back appear to be paying off as well. Management said that Uber’s ride hailing driver base at the end of September was comparable with the pre-pandemic level in September 2019.Third, Uber is now selling ads to its 124 million strong user base, promoting one brand per ride. With the third quarter runrate at $350 million, management confirmed their billion-dollar revenue target by 2024.Uber’s diversification into other revenue streams (including food delivery and freight, which didn’t do anything exciting in the last quarter) is a big positive for its future profitability and cash flow.Abiomed carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), Uber a Zacks Rank #3 and Carvana a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).One-Month Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

219,65db12b9-0682-3b5f-b883-4249ff9bfce8,MDT,2022-11-03,Medtronic PLC (MDT) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/medtronic-plc-mdt-trending-stock-130001480.html,1667394001,STORY,['MDT'],"[Medtronic (MDT) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this medical device company have returned +3.8%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - Products industry, which Medtronic falls in, has gained 5%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Medtronic is expected to post earnings of $1.28 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0%.The consensus earnings estimate of $5.53 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -0.4%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.82 indicates a change of +5.3% from what Medtronic is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Medtronic.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MDT _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Medtronic, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $7.72 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -1.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $31.55 billion and $32.84 billion estimates indicate -0.4% and +4.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMedtronic reported revenues of $7.37 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -7.7%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $1.41 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7.2 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.34%. The EPS surprise was +0.89%.Over the last four quarters, Medtronic surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Medtronic is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Medtronic. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

ESPR incurred a loss per share of 81 cents per share for the third quarter of 2022, narrower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimate of a loss of 93 cents per share and 88 cents, respectively. The company reported a loss of $2.62 per share in the year-ago period.Esperion generated revenues of $19.0 million, up 31.7% year over year. However, the reported figures missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $19.8 million and $21.2 million, respectively.Shares of Esperion have surged 65.6% so far this year against the industry’s 28.8% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchQuarter in DetailEsperion has two FDA-approved drugs — Nexletol and Nexlizet — in its commercial portfolio that are approved for treating elevated LDL-C (bad cholesterol). These two drugs are marketed as Nilemdo and Nustendi in Europe and several other ex-U.S. markets in partnership with Daiichi Sankyo. Esperion records royalties on sales of its drugs in Europe.Product revenues, solely from the United States, were $14.0 million in the third quarter, up approximately 28.2% year over year. Product revenues were up 2.8% sequentially.Esperion recorded royalty revenues of $1.6 million during the reported quarter, compared with $1.5 million in the year-ago quarter. Royalty revenues were driven by the commercial launch of Nilemdo and Nustendi in new countries and growth in previously-launched territories.Research and development (R&amp;D) expenses increased 15% from the year-ago period’s levels to $29.1 million. This was caused by an increase in costs for the CLEAR cardiovascular outcomes study (CVOT), which ESPR conducted.Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&amp;A) were down 36% year over year to $25.0 million, reflecting the positive impact of its cost-savings programs as part of its transformational plan announced in the fourth quarter of 2021.Overall, Esperion achieved year-over-year cost savings of 16.3% in operational expenses during the quarter.Story continuesAs of Sep 30, 2022, Esperion had cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and investment securities of $239.3 million compared with cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments of $235.8 million as of Jun 30, 2022.Pipeline UpdateEsperion is evaluating bempedoic acid, a key ingredient of its drugs, for its effects on the occurrence of major cardiovascular events in patients with or at high risk for cardiovascular disease who are ineligible for the lowest approved statin dose.During the second quarter, Esperion achieved 100% of targeted major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE-4) accumulation in the CLEAR CVOT study. Achieving this target will likely help ESPR complete this study early. Top-line data from this study is expected in first-quarter 2023. Positive data from the CVOT study is likely to boost the potential of Esperion’s drugs as the targeted patient population represents a lucrative opportunity.Since August, management has started activating sites for conducting the phase II CLEAR Path 1 study. The study will evaluate bempedoic acid in patients aged 6-17 years with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH).2022 GuidanceEsperion maintained its previous guidance for R&amp;D and SG&amp;A costs in 2022. The company expects R&amp;D expense for 2022 to be in the range of $100-$110 million, while SG&amp;A expense is expected to be between $120 million and $130 million.Esperion Therapeutics, Inc.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +12.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, which Merck falls in, has gained 9.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.57 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -12.8%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $7.38 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +22.6%. This estimate has changed +0.6% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.34 indicates a change of -0.5% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +2.3%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Merck.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Merck, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $13.76 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +1.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $59.04 billion and $58.34 billion estimates indicate +17.7% and -1.2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $14.96 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +13.7%. EPS of $1.85 for the same period compares with $1.75 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14.05 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +6.43%. The EPS surprise was +10.78%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Luppi has served in several ""first"" roles at our company in Italy: first female sales rep, first female product manager and then marketing manager, first female business unit and market access director, and the first female managing director.""Through these professional experiences, coupled with my personal life goals, I feel compelled to support other women to build an environment in which they can also thrive,"" said Luppi.To help progress their careers, Luppi shared her four top tips for women leaders:1.Be true to who you are and be confident about the value you bring to an organizationLuppi said some women have been taught to manage how they're perceived and to acquire similar skills as their male counterparts in order to successfully compete. ""I chose a different approach. I want to help show women how to be leaders while embracing who they are. It's not only the right thing to do for society, but it's also an economic imperative.""2.""If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together""Luppi said this quote resonates with her, adding that when you support others, you ""build an environment in which everyone can thrive.""3.Encourage your team to embrace gender diversityEnsure they understand why having equal or fair representation of genders on teams leads to diverse perspectives, which are critical to success. ""This will help create a culture in which everyone is accountable for making progress toward gender equality,"" Luppi said.4.Support women-oriented programs in societyFind areas that interest you and get involved, Luppi suggested. She's involved with groups that promote ""growth through diversity,"" which generate more opportunities for women, as well as activist efforts against female genital mutilation.Story continuesThanks to Luppi's leadership and commitment to developing women leaders and achieving gender diversity, our company in Italy was one of the first companies to eliminate the gender pay gap. And there's more: female colleagues at our company in Italy now represent 100 percent of the board, 60 percent of total employment, 50 percent of the leadership team, 74 percent of new hires and 70 percent of promotions.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Caterpillar CAT, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. JPM, Home Depot HD and Merck &amp; Co. MRK.Here are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:4 Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy as Dow Seals Record October GainsU.S. stocks slipped on Oct 31 as investors keep an eye on how much the Federal Reserve will hike interest rates this week to tame stubbornly high inflation. Lest we forget, the Fed's hawkish stance did batter the stock market for the most part of the year. However, despite Monday's losses, the major bourses were able to lock in gains for the month of October.While the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq were able to notch single-digit gains in October, it's the Dow that soared 14% and registered its best month since 1976. The blue-chip index, in fact, made a commendable comeback in October and snapped a two-month losing streak. The 30-stock index ended in the green for the month as investors continued to place their bets on traditional companies like banks.Most importantly, the blue-chip index primarily comprises energy and industrial stocks, which no doubt have been among the best-performing sectors since the beginning of this year. Energy shares have been gaining due to the rise in oil prices. In fact, the international benchmark for oil prices — Brent crude — jumped 7.8% last month.Oil prices, by the way, scaled north mostly due to the Russia-Ukraine war, and the resurgence of the Omicron variant of the coronavirus in China since all these led to a demand-supply disparity. Similarly, industrial shares gained, thanks to a thriving manufacturing sector, which is already boosting economic growth throughout the United States.Story continuesTalking about the economy, third-quarter GDP increased faster than expected and eased recession fears. In reality, it was the first positive quarter this year that witnessed the blue-chip stocks climbing northward.Another reason that led to the Dow notching remarkable gains last month was its lack of exposure to mega-cap tech stocks. These stocks, unfortunately, took a beating in recent times due to discouraging earnings results.For instance, blue-chip tech stocks like Verizon and Microsoft saw their shares tank over the course of October. While Verizon reported a decline in subscriber gains in the third quarter, Microsoft witnessed a slowdown in its cloud-computing business.Nonetheless, with the broader blue-chip index witnessing a sharp run-up in October, it's prudent to invest in blue-chip stocks that not only gained last month but also are poised to add more gains, banking on solid cash flows and a strong balance sheet. We have, thus, selected four such blue-chip stocks that carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here.Caterpillar is the largest global construction and mining equipment manufacturer. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 0.9% over the past 60 days. CAT's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 18%.JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. is one of the biggest global banks. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 3.2% over the past 60 days.

This compares to loss of $0.82 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -0.99%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this lawn and garden products company would post earnings of $1.70 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.98, delivering a surprise of 16.47%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Scotts , which belongs to the Zacks Fertilizers industry, posted revenues of $493.6 million for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.41%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $737.8 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Scotts shares have lost about 71.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.1%.What's Next for Scotts?While Scotts has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Scotts: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

Let's bring in Rockwell Automation Chairman and CEO Blake Moret for more on this. Blake, always good to see you. Top of your earnings release you note that organic sales in the fourth quarter up 20 and 1/2%. That's a very big gain against a backdrop of a slowing economy. Where are those sales coming from?BLAKE MORET: So we saw great sales in the fourth quarter. It was broad based. We serve a wide variety of industrial markets, from automotive, which had a very good quarter, semiconductor, as we're participating in the build down of capacity there, oil and gas, renewable energy with solar energy, food and beverage, pharmaceuticals. So really broad based across the spectrum.- With that kind of broad based results that you have seen, where do you kind of look across the business and really identify where there is perhaps even still cost management that needs to take place at this point in time?BLAKE MORET: Well, productivity is always a part of what we're doing, even in a time like this when we're seeing double digit growth. We saw, as you said, double digit growth in the last fiscal year, particularly strong in the fourth quarter. And as we go forward into our fiscal year '23, double digit growth again with strong earnings growth as well. Productivity for us and for our customers always remains in style.A big part of our value proposition is increased efficiency in all of these industries as well as helping them launch new lines of business. And we look inward and look for ways to be efficient ourselves.- Blake, I'm trying to figure out why your shares are down, frankly. And I don't know if it was the midpoint of the private forecast maybe being a little light of what analysts were predicting. But I also see your free cash flow was lower than some of the folks on the Street were predicting at about $358 million. Can you talk to us about your cash position and how you guys are spending and/or saving right now?Story continuesBLAKE MORET: Sure. We're traditionally a very strong converter of free cash flow. And one of the things that we see in an environment like this is an increase in our inventory, particularly components, work in process. As we're managing through the supply chain constraints, bringing in largely semiconductor chips, they're arriving at different times.And so we're making sure that we're bringing in that inventory so that when that last chip arrives, then we're able to get products out the door and improve the customer service and reduce lead times to customers. The downside of that is that higher inventory is reflected in higher working capital, which has a negative impact on free cash flow.- Blake, I mentioned before your organic sales in this-- in the fourth quarter, you just completed up 20 and 1/2%. But your outlook for the next 12 months, you see organic sales up 9% to 13%. How has this current quarter started?BLAKE MORET: Current quarter has started in line with our expectations. So our quarter began October 1. And so far, the quarter in terms of orders and shipments is developing in line with expectations. I want to also mention in an environment like this there's continued volatility. While we expect a gradual improvement in the supply chain and specifically around semiconductor availability for the types of node technologies that we use, we still believe a conservative approach is appropriate as we introduce guide for the year.- I'm also curious about whether a conservative approach is warranted on things like headcount. I noticed in the statement you talked about that you're committed to investing in attracting and retaining key talent. How are you thinking about workforce and headcount right now? Are you sort of holding the line on numbers but still focused on getting the best people in there? How does that work?BLAKE MORET: Well, we always focus on getting the best people in. And, obviously, making sure that we're an attractive destination for talent in always in compensation is certainly a part of that, increased amounts of equity as a part of total rewards, and all the other things that make Rockwell a great place to work. And with a continued low unemployment, then we recognize that talent, especially in some of the most high-demand jobs, have a lot of choices. And it's a fundamental part of our culture to consider all the other choices that an employee like a customer can go and to make sure that we match up really well.- Blake, good to see you. Blake Moret is Rockwell Automation CEO. Thanks so much.BLAKE MORET: Thank you.]"

This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.81 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Rockwell Automation shares have lost about 26.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.1%.What's Next for Rockwell Automation?While Rockwell Automation has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook.

However, total losses seen by insiders are still US$337k but in since the time of purchase.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. View our latest analysis for Boeing The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At BoeingIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Independent Non-Executive Chairman Lawrence Kellner bought US$1.0m worth of shares at a price of US$209 per share. That means that even when the share price was higher than US$147 (the recent price), an insider wanted to purchase shares. It's very possible they regret the purchase, but it's more likely they are bullish about the company. In our view, the price an insider pays for shares is very important. As a general rule, we feel more positive about a stock if insiders have bought shares at above current prices, because that suggests they viewed the stock as good value, even at a higher price.Happily, we note that in the last year insiders paid US$1.1m for 5.48k shares. On the other hand they divested 990.00 shares, for US$220k. In total, Boeing insiders bought more than they sold over the last year.

So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Insider OwnershipMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. Usually, the higher the insider ownership, the more likely it is that insiders will be incentivised to build the company for the long term. Insiders own 0.07% of Boeing shares, worth about US$62m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Boeing Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Boeing shares in the last quarter. However, our analysis of transactions over the last year is heartening. Insiders do have a stake in Boeing and their transactions don't cause us concern. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

Its shares are down 22% this year, compared with a 19% decline in the S&amp;P 500 index.However, a 9% jump in the U.S. aerospace company's shares in the past two days suggests investors are feeling more confident about its prospects even as supply-chain bottlenecks and growing risks of an economic recession remain a challenge.The company's shares closed up 6.3% at $156.75 on Thursday.Morgan Stanley analyst Kristine Liwag, who attended the investor conference, was ""positively surprised"" by Boeing's forecasts for sharp improvements in free cash flow in 2023 and beyond.The company needs to shore up cash flow to help pay off the debt it accumulated to get through the pandemic and the grounding of the 737 MAX, its best-selling model, after fatal crashes.The planemaker also does not expect to raise fresh equity or debt and intends to resume returning capital to shareholders.Liwag said she walked away from the conference ""incrementally"" positive. ""The worst is behind the company,"" she said.Goldman Sachs analyst Noah Poponak, who was also at the conference, said Boeing's outlook can bring in new investors.'A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS'Boeing's bullish pitch, however, was not enough for investors like Tim Ghriskey to reinvest in the company.Ghriskey, senior investment strategist at Ingalls &amp; Snyder, had sold all of his Boeing shares in late 2020.Story continuesHe said while the company has presented an ""achievable"" outlook, he would wait for improvements in its supply chain as well as more visibility on travel demand before deciding to invest again in the company.""They have to prove themselves to get back investor confidence,"" said Ghriskey. ""I think we're still a long way away from that.""Boeing's financial targets are contingent upon its success in increasing production and deliveries of 737 MAX and 787 planes. But shortages of parts and labor have been hobbling their production.The company said it has factored supply-chain constraints into its outlook. But delivering 800 planes at least by 2025 will require a significant ramp-up by castings and forgings suppliers, who are facing labor constraints.Aggressive interest rate hikes by major central banks to tame inflation have also worsened the global economic outlook, sparking concerns about consumer spending. As travel demand weakens, the demand for new planes is also expected to take a hit, upending Boeing's forecasts.The company, for example, expects to produce 10 787 planes per month by 2025. But some analysts say it will need multiple big orders from airlines to reach and stay at that rate.""They're banking on a lot of assumptions ... that may not be met,"" said Ghriskey.(Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh in Chicago and Abhijith Ganapavaram in BengaluruEditing by Shounak Dasgupta and Matthew Lewis)]"

The Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment was added beginning with the three months ended December 31, 2021, primarily due to our acquisition of Blattner Holding Company and its operating subsidiaries (Blattner) in October 2021. In conjunction with this change, certain prior year amounts have been recast to conform to this new segment reporting structure. The following table sets forth segment revenues, segment operating income (loss) and operating margins for the periods indicated. Operating margins are calculated by dividing operating income by revenues.Three Months Ended September 30,Nine Months Ended September 30,2022202120222021Revenues:Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions $  2,282,33251.2 %$  1,996,78959.5 %$ 6,620,45952.3 %$  5,488,59760.6 %Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions978,77921.9331,6799.92,778,64722.01,047,76611.6Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions1,198,64626.91,024,81030.63,258,17925.72,520,31227.8Consolidated revenues$  4,459,757100.0 %$  3,353,278100.0 %$  12,657,285100.0 %$  9,056,675100.0 %Operating income (loss):Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions (a)255,45711.2 %252,41512.6 %691,02610.4 %613,12111.2 %Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions88,8859.1 %35,86810.8 %240,5148.7 %111,09610.6 %Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions (b)101,3518.5 %68,1676.7 %239,4697.3 %100,9174.0 %Corporate and Non-Allocated Costs (c)(158,902)(3.6) %(108,373)(3.2) %(558,346)(4.4) %(301,677)(3.3) %Consolidated operating income$   286,7916.4 %$   248,0777.4 %$    612,6634.8 %$   523,4575.8 %(a) Included in Electric Power Infrastructure Solutions operating income was equity in earnings of integral unconsolidated affiliates of $10.6 million and $10.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 and $44.4 million and $22.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021.(b) Included in operating income for the Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 was a $23.6 million provision for credit loss related to receivables from a customer that declared bankruptcy in July 2021 and its affiliate. The provision for credit loss related to the receivables negatively impacted operating margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2021 by approximately 90 basis points.(c) Included in corporate and non-allocated costs was amortization expense of $67.1 million and $22.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 and $290.8 million and $65.4 million for the nine months ended September 30,2022 and 2021. Also included were acquisition and integration costs of $13.4 million and $6.2 million for the three months ended September 30,2022 and 2021 and $42.7 million and $9.5 million for the nine months ended September 30,2022 and 2021.Quanta Services, Inc. and SubsidiariesSupplemental Data(In thousands)(Unaudited)Remaining Performance Obligations and Backlog (a non-GAAP financial measure)Quanta's remaining performance obligations represent management's estimate of consolidated revenues that are expected to be realized from the remaining portion of firm orders for fixed price contracts not yet completed or for which work has not yet begun. For purposes of calculating remaining performance obligations, Quanta includes all estimated revenues attributable to consolidated joint ventures and variable interest entities, revenues from funded and unfunded portions of government contracts to the extent they are reasonably expected to occur, and revenues from change orders to the extent management believes additional contract revenues will be earned and are deemed probable of collection.While backlog is not a defined term under GAAP, it is a common measurement used in Quanta's industry. Quanta believes this non-GAAP financial measure enables it and its investors to more effectively forecast its future results and better identify future operating trends that may not otherwise be apparent. Quanta's remaining performance obligations, as described above, are a component of Quanta's backlog calculation, which also includes estimated orders under master service agreements (MSAs), including estimated renewals, and non-fixed price contracts expected to be completed within one year. Quanta's methodology for determining backlog may not be comparable to the methodologies used by other companies.The following table reconciles Quanta's total remaining performance obligations to its backlog by reportable segment along with estimates of amounts expected to be realized within 12 months:September 30, 2022December 31, 2021September 30, 202112 MonthTotal12 MonthTotal12 MonthTotalElectric Power Infrastructure SolutionsRemaining performance obligations$    2,207,737$    2,854,847$    2,002,862$    2,769,106$    1,884,602$    2,537,921Estimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts4,987,10510,126,7334,492,0389,447,7654,229,1008,952,148Backlog$    7,194,842$  12,981,580$    6,494,900$  12,216,871$    6,113,702$  11,490,069Renewable Energy Infrastructure SolutionsRemaining performance obligations$    2,305,314$    2,917,067$    2,178,846$    2,428,408$       934,959$    1,168,947Estimated orders under MSAs and short-term, non-fixed price contracts70,150116,92265,618120,23770,17273,086Backlog$    2,375,464$    3,033,989$    2,244,464$    2,548,645$    1,005,131$    1,242,033Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions]"

PWR is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 3, before the opening bell.In the last-reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2% and grew 45.2% year over year. Total revenues surpassed the consensus mark by 5.3% and increased 41.1% year over year.Encouragingly, earnings topped analysts’ expectations in 13 of the trailing 14 quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings remained unchanged at $1.77 per share over the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates a 19.6% increase from the year-ago earnings of $1.48 per share. The consensus mark for revenues is $4.38 billion, suggesting a 30.6% year-over-year rise.Quanta Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseQuanta Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseQuanta Services, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Quanta Services, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteDevelopment and deployment of technology solutions across the full spectrum of decarbonization efforts, including carbon management mitigation and compliance consulting, as well as all facets of infrastructure for providing carbon-free energy solutions, will benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter.The company has been capitalizing on the megatrends to lead the energy transition and enable technological development. Initiatives such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure and undergrounding of electrical infrastructure are gaining momentum. These factors should help the company to boost its profit level.Segment-wise, the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment (accounting for almost 59% of total revenues) is likely to have benefited from broad-based business strength driven by ongoing grid modernization, system hardening, renewable energy interconnections and solid execution.Also, contributions from larger transmission projects underway in Canada and revenues from the acquired businesses are likely to have supported bottom-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Higher profitability from the LUMA joint venture and other integral unconsolidated affiliates, along with communications and electric operations, might have added to the positives.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Electric Power segment’s revenues is pegged at $2,146 million, implying a decline from $2,328 million a year ago.The Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment (accounting for almost 14% of total revenues) has been benefiting from higher demand for gas utility and pipeline integrity services and pent-up demand for the services that were deferred due to the effects of COVID-19 on the downstream market.Meanwhile, the Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment — consists of services and solutions for infrastructure supporting the delivery of renewable energy — including renewable generation, electric transmission, substations and battery storage, with Blattner's operations representing the majority of those solutions. This addition is expected to have contributed to the company’s top line in the quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Quanta Services this time around.

EME reported third-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings and revenues surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and increased year over year.Given the solid momentum of the business activity amid a challenging macroeconomic environment, the company has lifted its revenues and earnings per share guidance for 2022.United Rentals, Inc. URI reported third-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate but revenues missed the same. The company has been gaining from the sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core rental business.URI also lifted its full-year guidance for total revenues and adjusted EBITDA, given broad-based end-market activity, contractor backlogs, customer sentiment and solid visibility.Otis Worldwide Corporation OTIS reported mixed results in third-quarter 2022. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and rose on a year-over-year basis. However, sales declined from the year-ago quarter’s figure and lagged the consensus mark.For 2022, OTIS expects adjusted net sales to be within $13.4-$13.5 billion, lower than the $13.6-$13.8 billion projected earlier. Adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to be $3.11-$3.15, suggesting 5-7% year-over-year growth.

Richard Nixon became the first president to visit China, and Britain had just joined the European Community.(PRNewsfoto/Virginia Natural Gas)Television watchers tuned in to hear detective Steve McGarrett say ""Book 'em Danno"" on Hawaii Five-O while teenagers lined up in arcades at shopping malls across the country to play the latest state-of-the-art video game, ""Pong.""It was also the year when Hayden Barry began his career at Virginia Natural Gas.After graduating from Warwick High School in Newport News, Hayden joined the energy company on November 13, 1972, at just 18 years old and now at 68, has no plans to retire any time soon.And if you are doing the math in your head, that's 50 years with Virginia Natural Gas (VNG), making him the longest-tenured employee ever with the company.A tall man with weathered features from years of working in the sun and on his farm, he leaned back in his chair as a big grin rolled across his face when asked why he was still working.""I just love my job and I'm too young to retire,"" said Hayden. ""I love being part of the VNG team and continuing to serve our customers.""Hayden grew up in the Hampton, Virginia area, and was born deaf, a disability that never got in his way of pursuing his dreams.""I was born deaf, and sound never existed in my life, so not hearing was completely normal to me,"" he said. ""I just knew that 'normal' people either went to college after high school or looked for a job. I choose the latter.""Hayden tried college life for two weeks after high school and decided it was not for him. Summoning his mom to pick him up at Blue Ridge Community College in Weyers Cave, Virginia, he returned home to start looking for a job.Job hunting is a grueling process but imagine how grueling it could be for someone who is deaf or hearing-impaired.  Hayden knew his disability could present challenges for many employers, but he also knew that everyone deserves to be considered for a job just as much as someone without a disability.Story continuesHe began his career with Virginia Natural Gas as a meter reader, then as a storeroom keeper, a position he held for 35 years until 2007.""I was responsible for all the inventory at three separate storerooms during that time,"" said Hayden. ""I moved over from Norfolk to Newport News in 1982 and took care of the storeroom there as well as Hanover and Suffolk. I'm a workaholic and I stayed busy all the time, which was perfect for me.""In 2007, he landed another position with the company, this time going back to his initial first job…meter reading.The VNG meter reading team drives more than 100,000 miles each year, capturing data automatically from a device mounted on company trucks. Hayden knew, he said, he had found the perfect job.""I'm home-based and since I work alone, I can start my day when the sun comes up, sometimes as early as 5:30 a.m.,"" Hayden said. ""it's a great job for someone my age.""While driving his route, Hayden does have the occasional interaction with customers. You may wonder how he communicates with them.""I read lips,"" he said.While not completely deaf, Hayden does have 15% hearing in his left ear and a cochlear implant in his right ear, which he waited until he was 50 years old to have implanted.""I hate it, so I rely on reading lips,"" he added. ""I'm self-taught and as long as I can see you talk, we can have a conversation. But because of my lack of hearing, I must make sure I also keep my head on a swivel, so I know if a dog or person is approaching as well as always being aware of my surroundings.""In his 50 years with the company, Hayden said he has seen a lot of people come and go. But one thing has remained constant…the quality of people that work at VNG.""People here have always treated me with respect and have not made my hearing loss a big deal,"" he said. ""Of course, there are things that I can and can't do, but all my supervisors and teammates have treated me well and taken care of me. They know that my job has been one of the main staple things in my life.""Fifty years ago, Hayden walked through a door of opportunity when it opened, and more importantly, had the courage to walk through it. One day, when the time is right, he said, he'll know when it's time to walk back out through that same door and retire.""I'll know when that time will come, but not today,"" said Hayden. ""When it comes, I'll spend more time on my farm, with my wife and the grandkids. But even then, I really won't be 'retired' since there will always be something to do.""About Virginia Natural Gas Virginia Natural Gas is one of four natural gas distribution companies of Southern Company Gas, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Southern Company (NYSE: SO).

Analysts on average expect a profit of $23 per share, according to Refinitiv data.Net income attributable to shareholders surged 70.1% to $2.76 billion due to a $1.4 billion after-tax gain from the sale of its Asia Pacific and Turkey accident and health business to Chubb Ltd.Excluding one-off items, Cigna's profit was $6.04 per share, beating consensus estimate of $5.71 per share.(Reporting by Raghav Mahobe and Leroy Leo in Bengaluru; Editing by Arun Koyyur and Maju Samuel)]"

To learn more about Cigna®, including links to follow us on Facebook or Twitter, visit www.cigna.com.Notes:1.Adjusted income (loss) from operations is a principal financial measure of profitability used by Cigna's management because it presents the underlying results of operations of Cigna's businesses and permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue, expenses and shareholders' net income. Adjusted income from operations is defined as shareholders' net income (or income before income taxes less pre-tax income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests for the segment metric) excluding net realized investment results, amortization of acquired intangible assets and special items. Cigna's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment using the equity method of accounting are also excluded. Special items are matters that management believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to their nature or size. Adjusted income (loss) from operations is measured on an after-tax basis for consolidated results and on a pre-tax basis for segment results. Consolidated adjusted income (loss) from operations is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, shareholders' net income. See Exhibit 1 for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted income from operations to shareholders' net income.2.Management is not able to provide a reconciliation of adjusted income from operations to shareholders' net income (loss) or adjusted revenues to total revenues on a forward-looking basis because it is unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, certain components thereof including (i) future net realized investment results (from equity method investments with respect to adjusted revenues) and (ii) future special items. These items are inherently uncertain and depend on various factors, many of which are beyond Cigna's control. As such, any associated estimate and its impact on shareholders' net income and total revenues could vary materially.The Company's outlook excludes the potential effects of any other business combinations that may occur after the date of this earnings release. The Company's outlook includes the potential effects of expected future share repurchases and anticipated 2022 dividends.As announced in January 2021, Cigna currently intends to pay regular quarterly dividends, with future declarations subject to approval by its Board of Directors and the Board's determination that the declaration of dividends remains in the best interests of Cigna and its shareholders. The decision of whether to pay future dividends and the amount of any such dividends will be based on the Company's financial position, results of operations, cash flows, capital requirements, the requirements of applicable law and any other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant.The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including price, general business and market conditions, and alternate uses of capital. The share repurchase program may be effected through open market purchases in compliance with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, including through Rule 10b5-1 trading plans, or privately negotiated transactions. The program may be suspended or discontinued at any time.3.Adjusted revenues is used by Cigna's management because it permits analysis of trends in underlying revenue. The Company defines adjusted revenues as total revenues excluding the following adjustments: special items and Cigna's share of certain realized investment results of its joint ventures reported in the Cigna Healthcare segment using the equity method of accounting. Special items are matters that management believes are not representative of the underlying results of operations due to their nature or size. We exclude these items from this measure because management believes they are not indicative of past or future underlying performance of the business. Adjusted revenues is not determined in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as a substitute for the most directly comparable GAAP measure, total revenues. See Exhibit 1 for a reconciliation of consolidated adjusted revenues to total revenues.4.On July 1, 2022, the Company completed the sale of its life, accident and supplemental benefits businesses in six countries (Hong Kong, Indonesia, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan and Thailand) to Chubb INA Holdings, Inc.

259,9045c42a-efa0-3d3a-bd19-b9e2596d8a22,CI,2022-11-03,MGIC Investment (MTG) Q3 Earnings Top Estimates,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mgic-investment-mtg-q3-earnings-225510917.html,1667429710,STORY,"['MTG', 'CI']","[MGIC Investment (MTG) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.86 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.55 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.46 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 56.36%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this mortgage insurance company would post earnings of $0.54 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.81, delivering a surprise of 50%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.MGIC , which belongs to the Zacks Insurance - Multi line industry, posted revenues of $296.06 million for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.11%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $294.74 million. The company has not been able to beat consensus revenue estimates over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.MGIC shares have lost about 5.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.1%.What's Next for MGIC?While MGIC has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for MGIC: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $0.59 on $305.11 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $2.55 on $1.22 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Insurance - Multi line is currently in the bottom 29% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.One other stock from the same industry, Cigna (CI), is yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 3.This health insurer is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.70 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -0.5%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.Cigna's revenues are expected to be $44.87 billion, up 1.3% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

260,c4d48532-a98e-35b5-af2e-d51bf94c0caf,CI,2022-11-03,Can Cigna's (CI) Q3 Earnings Beat on Evernorth Performance?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cignas-ci-q3-earnings-beat-155903560.html,1667404743,STORY,['CI'],"[Cigna Corporation CI is set to sustain its earnings beat streak for third-quarter 2022, the results of which are scheduled to be released on Nov 3, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the health service company’s adjusted earnings per share of $6.22 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 14.3% primarily on solid contributions from its businesses and strong membership growth. However, the upside was partly offset by higher benefits and expenses.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter earnings announcement.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share of $5.70 has witnessed no movement in the past week. The estimate is indicative of a 0.5% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported earnings of $5.73 per share. Our estimate for earnings per share is pegged at $5.68, indicating a 0.9% year-over-year decline.The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our estimate for revenues are both pegged at $44.9 billion, suggesting a rise of 1.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Cigna’s earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 10.7%. This is depicted in the graph below.Cigna Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Cigna Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCigna Corporation price-eps-surprise | Cigna Corporation QuoteWhat the Quantitative Model SuggestsOur proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Cigna this time around as well. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat, which is precisely the case here.Earnings ESP: Cigna has anEarnings ESP of +0.07%. This is because the Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.70 per share. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank:Cigna currently has a Zacks Rank #2.Factors Driving Q3 PerformanceStrong performances across CI’s Evernorth and Cigna Healthcare businesses are likely to contribute to its to-be-reported quarter’s results. The Evernorth unit is expected to have gained from a growing customer base and higher pharmacy script volumes in the to-be-reported quarter.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for pharmacy revenues implies a 3.4% rise from the year-ago quarter’s actuals. The metric is expected to have aided Evernorth’s September-end quarter’s performance. The consensus mark for Evernorth’s revenues is pegged at $34,958 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for pre-tax adjusted income from Evernorth is pegged at $1,658 million for the third quarter, whereas our estimate is pegged at $1,660 million. The metric is expected to have helped the company to increase its profits year over year. Our estimate for pre-tax income in Cigna Healthcare is pegged at $818 million.Our estimate for pre-tax income from other operations is pegged at $230.2 million. We expect the medical care ratio for the third quarter to be at 80.6%, suggesting a year-over-year decline of 380 basis points.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total medical customers signals a 5.9% increase from the year-ago period’s reported number. The consensus mark for fees and other revenues indicates 10.4% year-over-year growth, while our estimate suggests a 3.6% increase.However, Cigna’s net investment income is expected to have taken a hit in the third quarter. The consensus mark for net investment income is pegged at $308 million, suggesting a decrease from the $468 million reported in the prior-year quarter. Our estimate for the metric is pegged at $363.5 million. The decline in the metric is expected to have partially offset the positives in the quarter under review. Also, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for premiums signals a 4% year-over-year decline for the third quarter, whereas our estimate suggests a 3.2% fall from the year-ago period’s reported figure.Other Stocks That Warrant a LookHere are some other companies worth considering from the broader medical space, as our model shows that these, too, have the right combination of elements to beat on earnings this time around:NuVasive, Inc. NUVA currently has an Earnings ESP of +15.55% and is a Zacks #3 Ranked player.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NuVasive’s earnings per share for the to-be-reported quarter indicates a 65.6% year-over-year increase.

The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because Cigna is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for CI in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently higher than the broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of $5.70 per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for CI, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +0.07% heading into earnings season.Cigna Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCigna Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseCigna Corporation price-eps-surprise | Cigna Corporation QuoteWhy is this Important?A positive reading for the Zacks Earnings ESP has proven to be very powerful in producing both positive surprises, and outperforming the market. Our recent 10-year backtest shows that stocks that have a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better show a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and have returned over 28% on average in annual returns (see more Top Earnings ESP stocks here).Given that CI has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and an ESP in positive territory, investors might want to consider this stock ahead of earnings. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Clearly, recent earnings estimate revisions suggest that good things are ahead for Cigna, and that a beat might be in the cards for the upcoming report.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

264,bf0259a0-a9ef-3ae5-aca3-8918945ebe0a,NOC,2022-11-03,Possible bearish signals as Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) insiders disposed of US$2.2m worth of stock,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/possible-bearish-signals-northrop-grumman-130050039.html,1667480450,STORY,['NOC'],"[The fact that multiple Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.Although we don't think shareholders should simply follow insider transactions, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. See our latest analysis for Northrop Grumman The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Northrop GrummanIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the insider, David Perry, sold US$1.2m worth of shares at a price of US$394 per share. That means that even when the share price was below the current price of US$530, an insider wanted to cash in some shares. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. Please do note, however, that sellers may have a variety of reasons for selling, so we don't know for sure what they think of the stock price. This single sale was just 25% of David Perry's stake.In the last year Northrop Grumman insiders didn't buy any company stock. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does Northrop Grumman Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Northrop Grumman insiders own about US$149m worth of shares (which is 0.2% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Northrop Grumman Insiders?The fact that there have been no Northrop Grumman insider transactions recently certainly doesn't bother us. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Northrop Grumman insiders selling. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Northrop Grumman you should be aware of.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out George Soros Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Large-Cap Stock Picks. George Soros, a Hungarian-American businessman, founded Soros Fund Management in 1970. Soros Fund Management is a New York-based hedge fund which carved its place as one of the most profitable funds on Wall Street, however, it is now structured as a family office. The George Soros stock portfolio is worth $5.6 billion as of the second quarter of 2022, and the billionaire makes highly leveraged investments keeping in mind the currency movements and commodity prices, as well as fundamental macroeconomic and market analysis. The condition of the housing market also plays an important role in his investment decisions. Soros tends to invest in large-cap, small-cap, exchange traded funds, and both growth and value plays. Large-cap stocks are usually perceived as less risky. These tend to be companies that are very stable and dominate their respective sectors, with market capitalization ranging from $10 billion to $200 billion. These prominent firms have fortress balance sheets and the ability to withstand market volatility. Large-cap companies also usually return a percentage of their profits to shareholders as dividends, which helps investors navigate a downturn in the economy relatively better. Some of the best large-cap stocks in the George Soros stock portfolio are Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Our Methodology We selected the top large-cap stock picks from George Soros’ stock portfolio as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. George Soros Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Large-Cap Stock PicksGeorge Soros Stock Portfolio: Top Large-Cap Stock Picks10. Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) is a Colorado-based communications company that provides a range of wireless, data, video, voice, and managed services to residential customers, businesses, government entities, and educational and medical institutions. In Q2 2022, the George Soros stock portfolio had 1.75 million shares of Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA), worth $202.35 million and representing 3.6% of the total 13F securities. Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) has been part of the Soros portfolio since the second quarter of 2016. Story continuesOn May 10, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft maintained a Buy recommendation on Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $158 from $196.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) was part of 27 public stock portfolios, compared to 26 in the prior quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management held the leading position in the company, comprising 8.30 million shares worth $960.2 million. Like Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) is one of the top large-cap picks from the George Soros stock portfolio. Alphyn Capital made the following comment about Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In retrospect, I wish I had cut the position in Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) more aggressively last quarter. Fears of fixed wireless and fiber competition have weighed heavily on Charter and Liberty’s share prices. Tom Rutledge’s unexpected early retirement from the CEO role has not helped matters.I believe the sentiment is now overly pessimistic, and the valuation once again attractive. Revenue growth from broadband ads will likely stall as fixed wireless access programs take a bite out of cable subscribers over the next five years. 4 However, Charter has a fast-growing mobile phone business through an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Verizon. Given its cost-effective access to Verizon’s mobile telephony infrastructure, it provides a branded mobile phone service to retail customers at competitive rates. For example, Unlimited pricing starts at $29.99/month, including taxes and fees, vs. $35-55/month plus taxes and fees for Verizon’s plans.Wireless generates approximately $725m in revenues for Charter per quarter, around 6% of the total, and is growing 40% per year. Should this continue, Wireless could return Charter to mid-single-digit revenue growth and “drive meaningful EBITDA for Charter,” as revenues scale over a low cost base. With approximately 25m non-Charter potential wireless customers within the area it serves, there is plenty of room for growth.”9. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a California-based company that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles and related accessories. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is the largest holding in the George Soros stock portfolio, with 17.8 million shares worth $459 million, representing 8.17% of the total securities. Soros Fund Management added Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) to its portfolio in the last quarter of 2021. On October 11, after a conversation with the management, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh said that Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)’s vehicle recall is ""relatively minor"" and that its manufacturing lines have already been updated. He believes Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) has seen the issue on ""less than 1%"" of vehicles and the company forecasts the cost of fixing the recall to be ""minimal"". The analyst noted that the headlines are ""worse than reality"" and maintained a Buy rating on the shares with a $65 price target.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 35 funds reported owning stakes worth $1.6 billion in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 29 funds in the prior quarter worth $4 billion. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 18.8 million shares worth $486 million. Here is what Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund has to say about Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Rivian Automotive, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells consumer and commercial electric vehicles. Shares of Rivian declined 48.2% in the second quarter as investors continued rotating out of long-duration assets and have become increasingly concerned about capital intensity and cash burn.At the same time, Rivian continues to be impacted by supply chain issues which are causing delays in its production ramp. Rivian is addressing those challenges by diversifying its supply chain to alleviate shortages while also consolidating the number of variants in development to reduce cash burn (the company guided that current cash will be enough to support the company’s future platform launch ‘R2’ in 2025). Rivian recently reported stronger-than-expected second quarter production numbers while reiterating its annual guidance of producing 25,000 units.As semiconductor shortages ease, we believe that the company will be able to rapidly ramp its production. We retain conviction in the shares given management’s vision, Rivian’s product positioning, the company’s relationship with Amazon.com, and its strong balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, Rivian had $17 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which will help it overcome the current challenges while taking advantage of the long-term opportunity as the market transitions to electric vehicles.”8. Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) was founded in 2011 and is based in Dublin, Ireland. The company manufactures and sells electrical, electronic, and safety technology solutions to the automotive and commercial vehicle markets worldwide. In the second quarter of 2022, the George Soros stock portfolio lifted its Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) stake by 1%, holding 246,055 shares worth nearly $22 million. The stock has been part of the Soros portfolio since Q2 2020. On September 28, Berenberg analyst Jared Maymon assumed coverage of Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) with a Buy rating and a $130 price target. The analyst noted that content per vehicle is increasing and Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is gaining share. He believes Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is well positioned to capture a significant share of an expanded total addressable market in the long term.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 43 hedge funds were long Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) at the end of June 2022, compared to 48 funds in the earlier quarter. Ian Simm’s Impax Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.6 million shares worth $417 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Sustainability Leaders Strategy has to say about Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“The acceleration in electrification of transport should support electric vehicle (EV)-related stocks like Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), which came under pressure in the quarter on concerns the auto cycle is past its peak. Aptiv provides a range of solutions for the auto industry, including autonomous driving technologies, safety technologies, components, and wiring. The large exposure of APTV to EVs should lead to long-term value as EVs continue their growth, boosted by their relative attractiveness as prices at the pump hit near-historic highs.”7. D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is a Texas-based homebuilding company that constructs and sells residential homes under the D.R. Horton, America's Builder, Express Homes, Emerald Homes, and Freedom Homes brands. In Q2 2022, the George Soros stock portfolio featured nearly 3 million shares of D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), worth $197 million and representing 3.5% of the total holdings. Raymond James analyst Buck Horne on October 21 downgraded D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) to Outperform from Strong Buy with a price target of $77, down from $103. The downgrade factors in the analyst’s more concerned outlook on the housing market as mortgage rates have driven affordability to uncharted highs. However, he remains constructive on D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) in this environment as the sector’s most cost-efficient producer of single-family housing.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) was part of 44 public stock portfolios at the end of June 2022, compared to 52 in the last quarter. John Armitage’s Egerton Capital Limited is the leading position holder in the company, with 7.6 million shares worth $504 million. Here is what Third Avenue Management specifically said about D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is the largest homebuilder in the US by volume (the company sold more than 90k homes in the past year) with a well-recognized focus on delivering quality product at the entry-level price point (its average selling price is less than $400k) and market-leading positions in key Sunbelt markets.While the near-term outlook for DR Horton remains uncertain given the adjustments occurring in the US residential markets, the medium-to-long-term prospects for volume-based homebuilders with super-strong balance sheets and scale advantages continue to be promising in Fund Management’s view. More specifically, (i) residential inventories remain around record-low levels in most major markets when gauged by aggregate units available (see chart below), (ii) demand for single-family residences seem to have multiple secular drivers as the largest generation in US history (the “millennial cohort”) enters its prime home buying years and desires more space not only due to “life events” but also “remote” and “hybrid” working arrangements, and (iii) significant inflation in rental rates for multi-family units in urban areas has left the rent-to-own proposition for single-family homes in suburban areas in a compelling range (particularly in the Sunbelt region which is experiencing outsized job growth and wage growth relative to broader national figures).In Fund Management’s view, the two industry participants that seem most likely to take part in this shift include DR Horton and Lennar Corp. (a long-held position in the Fund). In conjunction, these two “blue-chip builders” now account for approximately 10% of the Fund’s capital, as well as roughly one out of every five new homes built in the Sunbelt. They would also qualify under Third Avenue Founder Marty Whitman’s “Safe and Cheap” maxim as both companies are nearly “net-cash” (i.e., more cash than debt) with common stocks trading at less than five times trailing earnings, on average.”6. Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 61Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is an American-Irish professional services company, providing technology support, application modernization, enterprise architecture, software and quality engineering, data management, intelligent automation comprises robotic process automation, and natural language processing, among others. Securities filings for the second quarter of 2022 reveal that Soros Fund Management held 119,862 shares of Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN), worth $33.2 million and representing 0.59% of the total portfolio. The hedge fund strengthened its hold on the stock by 4% in Q2 2022. On September 22, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) declared a $1.12 per share quarterly dividend, a 15.5% increase from its prior dividend of $0.97. The dividend is payable to shareholders on November 15. The company’s board has also approved $3 billion in additional share repurchase authorization, bringing total outstanding repurchase authorization to approximately $6.1 billion.JPMorgan analyst Tien-tsin Huang on October 14 and reiterated an Overweight rating on  Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $306 from $329. The analyst revised estimates down to reflect currency headwinds.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) was part of 61 public stock portfolios at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 63 in the last quarter. Nicolai Tangen’s Ako Capital is the biggest position holder in the company, with 2.3 million shares worth $636 million.In addition to Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) is one of the premier large-cap stock picks of billionaire George Soros. Here is what Baron Durable Advantage Fund has to say about Accenture plc (NYSE:ACN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Accenture plc provides consulting and technology services to corporate clients worldwide. Quarterly financial results exceeded Street expectations with 22% revenue growth and 23% operating income growth. However, shares fell 17.5% during the quarter due to adverse foreign currency movements weighing on next quarter’s guidance and investor concerns about macroeconomic uncertainty impacting client demand. We believe demand for Accenture’s services will be resilient over the long term and the company will continue gaining share in a large global market helping its clients digitally transform.” Click to continue reading and see George Soros Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Large-Cap Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:9 Biggest Car Rental Companies in the World10 Cheap Growth Stocks To Buy11 Safe Stocks To Invest In Disclosure: None.

266,beb9a46c-f625-30a9-9ba6-d8ecaa34190f,NKE,2022-11-03,"What Does NIKE, Inc.'s (NYSE:NKE) Share Price Indicate?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/does-nike-inc-nyse-nke-120039961.html,1667476839,STORY,['NKE'],"[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE). The company's stock saw significant share price movement during recent months on the NYSE, rising to highs of US$118 and falling to the lows of US$83.12. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether NIKE's current trading price of US$90.30 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at NIKE’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for NIKE What Is NIKE Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 7.6% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy NIKE today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $97.76, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that NIKE’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of NIKE look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. NIKE's earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 32%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? NKE’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on NKE, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.Since timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are.

This consistent and strong operational performance bolsters our confidence in achieving our full-year financial guidance.”   The non-GAAP financial results highlighted, and the non-GAAP financial outlook for 2022 discussed below, represent non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these measures to the appropriate GAAP measures, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, and for the 2022 financial outlook, can be found later in this release.   / Financial ResultsAnsys' third quarter and year-to-date (YTD) 2022 and 2021 financial results are presented below. The 2022 and 2021 non-GAAP results exclude the income statement effects of the acquisition accounting adjustments to deferred revenue from business combinations closed prior to 2022, stock-based compensation, excess payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, expenses related to business combinations and adjustments for the income tax effect of the excluded items.GAAP and non-GAAP results are as follows: GAAP Non-GAAP(in millions, except per share data and percentages)Q3 QTD 2022 Q3 QTD 2021 % Change Q3 QTD 2022 Q3 QTD 2021 % ChangeRevenue$472.5  $441.2  7% $473.7  $445.4  6%Net income$96.0  $85.3  12% $154.7  $140.3  10%Diluted earnings per share$1.10  $0.97  13% $1.77  $1.59  11%Operating profit margin 26.1%  24.4%    41.0%  39.7%   GAAP Non-GAAP(in millions, except per share data and percentages)Q3 YTD 2022 Q3 YTD 2021 % Change Q3 YTD 2022 Q3 YTD 2021 % ChangeRevenue$1,371.4  $1,251.0  10% $1,378.2  $1,270.1  9%Net income$265.8  $251.5  6% $428.5  $401.8  7%Diluted earnings per share$3.04  $2.86  6% $4.90  $4.56  7%Operating profit margin 24.2%  21.9%    38.9%  38.6%  / Other Performance Metrics(in millions, except percentages)Q3 QTD 2022 Q3 QTD 2021 % Change % Change inConstantCurrencyACV$409.3 $365.4 12% 20%Operating cash flows$127.2 $157.8 (19)%  Unlevered operating cash flows$132.0 $160.0 (18)%  (in millions, except percentages)Q3 YTD 2022 Q3 YTD 2021 % Change % Change in Constant CurrencyACV$1,213.7 $1,115.4 9% 15%Operating cash flows$457.0 $447.8 2%  Unlevered operating cash flows$467.0 $454.9 3%  ACV is a metric the Company uses to better understand the business. There is no GAAP measure comparable to ACV. ACV is composed of the following:the annualized value of maintenance and subscription lease contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plusthe value of perpetual license contracts with start dates during the period, plusthe annualized value of fixed-term services contracts with start dates or anniversary dates during the period, plusthe value of work performed during the period on fixed-deliverable services contracts./ Management's 2022 Financial OutlookThe Company's fourth quarter and updated FY 2022 revenue, diluted earnings per share and ACV guidance is provided below. The Company is also updating its FY 2022 guidance for operating cash flows. The revenue and diluted earnings per share guidance is provided on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. Non-GAAP financial measures exclude the income statement effects of acquisition adjustments to deferred revenue, stock-based compensation, excess payroll taxes related to stock-based compensation, amortization of acquired intangible assets, acquisition-related expenses and adjustments for the income tax effect of the excluded items.This guidance is based on the Company's evaluation of factual information it has determined to be relevant and the application of certain assumptions made by the Company. Please refer to the Company's prepared remarks document for additional information regarding the Company's financial guidance, including its assumptions regarding overall business dynamics./ Fourth Quarter 2022 Guidance The Company currently expects the following for the quarter ending December 31, 2022:(in millions, except percentages and per share data)GAAP Non-GAAPRevenue$621.3 - $656.3 $621.8 - $656.8Revenue Growth Rate(5.2%) - 0.1% (6.0%) - (0.7%)Revenue Growth Rate — Constant Currency2.5% - 7.8% 1.7% - 6.9%Diluted earnings per share$1.91 - $2.28 $2.58 - $2.90The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance presented above is a result of the expected impact of the application of the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations closed prior to 2022 in the amount of $0.5 million for the quarter ending December 31, 2022.(in millions, except percentages)Other Financial MetricsACV$761.3 - $786.3ACV Growth Rate0.8% - 4.1%ACV Growth Rate — Constant Currency8.1% - 11.4%/ Fiscal Year 2022 GuidanceThe Company currently expects the following for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022:(in millions, except percentages and per share data)GAAP Non-GAAPRevenue$1,992.7 - $2,027.7 $2,000.0 - $2,035.0Revenue Growth Rate4.5% - 6.3% 3.5% - 5.4%Revenue Growth Rate — Constant Currency11.1% - 13.0% 10.1% - 11.9%Diluted earnings per share$4.95 - $5.31 $7.48 - $7.80The difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP revenue guidance presented above is a result of the expected impact of the application of the fair value provisions applicable to the accounting for business combinations closed prior to 2022 in the amount of $7.3 million for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022.(in millions, except percentages)Other Financial MetricsACV$1,975.0 - $2,000.0ACV Growth Rate5.6% - 6.9%ACV Growth Rate — Constant Currency12.0% - 13.4%Operating cash flows$570.0 - $600.0Despite an ongoing volatile macroeconomic environment, the updated FY 2022 guidance reflects an operational raise on ACV, revenue, diluted EPS and operating cash flows driven by the underlying strength of our business model and market position. Offsetting this outlook, persistent and meaningful U.S. Dollar strengthening in exchange rates continues to drive unprecedented headwinds. As a result, the guidance assumes additional incremental adverse impacts from currency, primarily driven by substantial weakening in the Euro and Japanese Yen.The impact of currency on our results continues to be significant and driven by the macroeconomic environment. The underlying foundation of our business remains strong, and we continue to see momentum.

These financial measures exclude the impact of certain items and, therefore, have not been calculated in accordance with GAAP. A detailed explanation of each of the adjustments to such financial measures is described below. This press release also contains a reconciliation of each of these non-GAAP financial measures to its most comparable GAAP financial measure.We use non-GAAP financial measures (a) to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance as well as our performance relative to our competitors, (b) to set internal sales targets and spending budgets, (c) to allocate resources, (d) to measure operational profitability and the accuracy of forecasting, (e) to assess financial discipline over operational expenditures and (f) as an important factor in determining variable compensation for management and employees. In addition, many financial analysts that follow us focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on non-GAAP financial measures. We believe that it is in the best interest of our investors to provide this information to analysts so that they accurately report the non-GAAP financial information. Moreover, investors have historically requested, and we have historically reported, these non-GAAP financial measures as a means of providing consistent and comparable information with past reports of financial results.While we believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, are not reported by all our competitors and may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of our competitors due to potential differences in the exact method of calculation. We compensate for these limitations by using these non-GAAP financial measures as supplements to GAAP financial measures and by reviewing the reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to their most comparable GAAP financial measures.The adjustments to these non-GAAP financial measures, and the basis for such adjustments, are outlined below:Acquisition accounting for deferred revenue. Historically, we have consummated acquisitions in order to support our strategic and other business objectives. Under prior accounting guidance, a fair value provision resulted in acquired deferred revenue that was often recorded on the opening balance sheet at an amount that was lower than the historical carrying value. Although this fair value provision has no impact on our business or cash flow, it adversely impacts our reported GAAP revenue in the reporting periods following an acquisition. In 2022, we adopted accounting guidance which eliminates the fair value provision that resulted in the deferred revenue adjustment on a prospective basis. In order to provide investors with financial information that facilitates comparison of both historical and future results, we provide non-GAAP financial measures which exclude the impact of the acquisition accounting adjustment for acquisitions prior to the adoption of the new guidance in 2022. We believe that this non-GAAP financial adjustment is useful to investors because it allows investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our past and future reports of financial results as the revenue reduction related to acquired deferred revenue will not recur when related subscription lease licenses and software maintenance contracts are renewed in future periods.Amortization of intangible assets from acquisitions. We incur amortization of intangible assets, included in our GAAP presentation of amortization expense, related to various acquisitions we have made. We exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance because these costs are fixed at the time of an acquisition, are then amortized over a period of several years after the acquisition and generally cannot be changed or influenced by us after the acquisition. Accordingly, we do not consider these expenses for purposes of evaluating our performance during the applicable time period after the acquisition, and we exclude such expenses when making decisions to allocate resources. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our past reports of financial results as we have historically reported these non-GAAP financial measures.Stock-based compensation expense. We incur expense related to stock-based compensation included in our GAAP presentation of cost of maintenance and service; research and development expense; and selling, general and administrative expense. This non-GAAP adjustment also includes excess payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation. Although stock-based compensation is an expense and viewed as a form of compensation, we exclude these expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance. Specifically, we exclude stock-based compensation during our annual budgeting process and our quarterly and annual assessments of our performance. The annual budgeting process is the primary mechanism whereby we allocate resources to various initiatives and operational requirements. Additionally, the annual review by our board of directors during which it compares our historical business model and profitability to the planned business model and profitability for the forthcoming year excludes the impact of stock-based compensation. In evaluating the performance of our senior management and department managers, charges related to stock-based compensation are excluded from expenditure and profitability results. In fact, we record stock-based compensation expense into a stand-alone cost center for which no single operational manager is responsible or accountable. In this way, we can review, on a period-to-period basis, each manager's performance and assess financial discipline over operational expenditures without the effect of stock-based compensation. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.Expenses related to business combinations. We incur expenses for professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, which are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative expense. Beginning in the second quarter of 2022, we have updated this non-GAAP measure to include, in addition to professional services rendered in connection with business combinations, other expenses directly related to business combinations, including compensation expenses and concurrent restructuring activities, such as employee severances and other exit costs. These costs are included in our GAAP presentation of selling, general and administrative and research and development expenses. The additional expenses were not material in the current or comparable period. We exclude these acquisition-related expenses for the purpose of calculating non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating profit margin, non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share when we evaluate our continuing operational performance, as we generally would not have otherwise incurred these expenses in the periods presented as a part of our operations. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate our operating results and the effectiveness of the methodology used by us to review our operating results, and (b) review historical comparability in our financial reporting as well as comparability with competitors' operating results.Non-GAAP tax provision. We utilize a normalized non-GAAP annual effective tax rate (AETR) to calculate non-GAAP measures. This methodology provides better consistency across interim reporting periods by eliminating the effects of non-recurring items and aligning the non-GAAP tax rate with our expected geographic earnings mix. To project this rate, we analyzed our historic and projected non-GAAP earnings mix by geography along with other factors such as our current tax structure, recurring tax credits and incentives, and expected tax positions. On an annual basis we will re-evaluate this rate for significant items that may materially affect our projections.Unlevered operating cash flows. We make cash payments for the interest incurred in connection with our debt financing which are included in our GAAP presentation of operating cash flows. We exclude this cash paid for interest, net of the associated tax benefit, for the purpose of calculating unlevered operating cash flows. Unlevered operating cash flow is a supplemental non-GAAP measure that we use to evaluate our core operating business. We believe this measure is useful to investors and management because it provides a measure of our cash generated through operating activities independent of the capital structure of the business.Non-GAAP financial measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative for, GAAP. Our non-GAAP financial measures are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures and should be read only in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.We have provided a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures as listed below:GAAP Reporting MeasureNon-GAAP Reporting MeasureRevenueNon-GAAP RevenueGross ProfitNon-GAAP Gross ProfitGross Profit MarginNon-GAAP Gross Profit MarginOperating IncomeNon-GAAP Operating IncomeOperating Profit MarginNon-GAAP Operating Profit MarginNet IncomeNon-GAAP Net IncomeDiluted Earnings Per ShareNon-GAAP Diluted Earnings Per ShareOperating Cash FlowsUnlevered Operating Cash FlowsConstant currency. In addition to the non-GAAP financial measures detailed above, we use constant currency results for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons by excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations on the reported results. To present this information, the 2022 results for entities whose functional currency is a currency other than the U.S. Dollar were converted to U.S. Dollars at rates that were in effect for the 2021 comparable period, rather than the actual exchange rates in effect for 2022. Constant currency growth rates are calculated by adjusting the 2022 reported amounts by the 2022 currency fluctuation impacts and comparing the adjusted amounts to the 2021 comparable period reported amounts. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors because they allow investors to (a) evaluate the effectiveness of the methodology and information used by us in our financial and operational decision-making, and (b) compare our reported results to our past reports of financial results without the effects of foreign currency fluctuations./ About AnsysWhen visionary companies need to know how their world-changing ideas will perform, they close the gap between design and reality with Ansys simulation.

(NYSE:PFE) today announced its investigational cancer immunotherapy, elranatamab, received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of people with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM). Elranatamab is a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA)-CD3-targeted bispecific antibody (BsAb).""The FDA’s Breakthrough Designation recognizes the potential of elranatamab as an innovative medicine for people with multiple myeloma whose disease has relapsed or is refractory to existing treatments, which at present leaves very few avenues for staving off this currently incurable cancer,"" said Chris Boshoff, M.D., Ph.D., Chief Development Officer, Oncology and Rare Disease, Pfizer Global Product Development. ""This marks Pfizer’s twelfth FDA Breakthrough Therapy Designation in Oncology, a testament to our relentless commitment to developing transformational cancer medicines in areas of high unmet need. We look forward to working with the FDA to accelerate the development of this therapy.""The FDA’s Breakthrough Therapy Designation is intended to expedite the development and review of a medicine that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease and preliminary clinical evidence indicates the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies.1BsAbs are a novel form of cancer immunotherapy that bind to and engage two different targets at once. One arm binds directly to specific antigens on cancer cells and the other arm binds to T-cells, bringing both cell types together. Elranatamab is designed to bind to BCMA, which is highly expressed on the surface of multiple myeloma (MM) cells, and the CD3 receptor found on the surface of T-cells, bridging them together and activating the T-cells to kill the myeloma cells. The binding affinity of elranatamab for BCMA and CD3 has been engineered to elicit potent T-cell mediated anti-myeloma activity. Elranatamab is administered subcutaneously, which offers more convenience over intravenous administration, and may mitigate the risk of potential adverse events, such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS).Story continuesThe Breakthrough Therapy Designation is based on six-month follow-up data from cohort A (n=123) of MagnetisMM-3, an open-label, multicenter, single arm, Phase 2 study evaluating the safety and efficacy of elranatamab monotherapy in patients with RRMM. Patients received subcutaneous (SC) elranatamab 76 mg weekly (QW) with a 2-step-up priming dose regimen administered during the first week. The study showed elranatamab demonstrated a manageable safety profile, and at a median follow-up of 6.8 months, patients achieved an overall response rate (ORR) of 61.0%. Among responders, there was 90.4% probability of maintaining a response ≥6 months. The most common treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) regardless of causality was CRS (57.9%), with the majority of events reported being either Grade 1 (43.2%) or Grade 2 (14.2%). Updated data from MagnetisMM-3 will be presented at the 64th American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting and Exposition 2022 (ASH 2022), taking place December 10-13, 2022, in New Orleans.MagnetisMM-3 is part of the robust MagnetisMM clinical research program, which has registration-intent trials planned or ongoing that explore elranatamab both as monotherapy and in combination with standard or novel therapies, spanning multiple patient populations from newly diagnosed multiple myeloma (NDMM), double-class exposed disease and RRMM.In addition to the Breakthrough Therapy Designation, elranatamab has been granted Orphan Drug Designation by the FDA and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for the treatment of MM. The FDA and EMA have granted elranatamab Fast Track Designation and the PRIME scheme, respectively, for the treatment of patients with RRMM. The UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has also granted elranatamab Innovative Medicine Designation and the Innovation Passport, for the treatment of MM.About Multiple MyelomaMM is a blood cancer that affects plasma cells made in the bone marrow. Healthy plasma cells make antibodies that help the body fight infection. According to the latest figures available, there are over 34,000 new cases of MM diagnosed annually in the U.S. and 176,000 globally.2, 3 Despite treatment advances, MM remains incurable. The median overall survival is just over five years, and most patients receive four or more lines of therapy.4About Pfizer OncologyAt Pfizer Oncology, we are committed to advancing medicines wherever we believe we can make a meaningful difference in the lives of people living with cancer.

Adjusted earnings improved 25% year over year on a reported basis and 11% at a constant exchange rate (“CER”).Quarterly revenues increased 18% on a reported basis and 9% at CER to $9.2 billion (£7.8 billion), beating both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates of $7.8 billion and $7.4 billion, respectively. The upside can be attributed to a rise in sales across all business segments and additional sales from its COVID-19 antibody drug, Xevudy.In July, GSK completed the spin-off of its consumer healthcare segment into a new standalone company called Haleon HLN. From second-quarter 2022 onward, GSK’s commercial operations constitute only the BioPharma business. Management now reports financial figures under three segments: Specialty Medicines, Vaccines and General Medicines.Prior to the demerger, Haleon was a joint venture between GSK and Pfizer PFE. Pfizer holds a 32% stake in Haleon and GSK holds a 6% stake. A 54.5% stake in Haleon is held by GSK’s shareholders. Pfizer intends to sell its overall stake in Haleon.BioPharma Business Remains StrongFollowing the demerger of the consumer healthcare business, the BioPharma business includes all medicines and vaccines, including Xevudy, in GSK’s portfolio. Sales were up across all segments under the BioPharma business, especially Specialty Medicines.Sales from commercial operations were driven by continued sales growth across all segments, especially strong sales of Shingrix, Trelegy and additional Xevudy sales. Excluding sales from Xevudy, total BioPharma sales were up 7% at CER.Sales in the United States were up 2%. Sales in European and International markets gained 11% and 20%, respectively, at CER.Sales of the Specialty Medicines segment surged 24% at CER, driven by consistent growth across all therapy areas. Revenues from the Specialty Medicines segment were up 11% at CER, excluding Xevudy sales. Sales growth of HIV, oncology and respiratory drugs was strong.Story continuesXevudy generated sales of £411 million in the third quarter, compared with £466 million in the second quarter. Xevudy sales contributed 13 percentage points at CER to the Specialty Medicines segment growth. However, the drug negatively impacted adjusted margins due to its higher cost of sales. More than 90% of the drug’s sales were generated from International markets. GSK markets Xevudy in collaboration with Vir Biotechnology.HIV sales increased 7% at CER. Sales growth of new HIV drugs — Juluca, Dovato, Cabenuva, Rukobia and Arpetude — and favorable pricing mix in the United States were partially offset by weaker sales of Triumeq and Tivicay. It is worth mentioning that GSK markets Juluca in collaboration with J&amp;J JNJ.GSK generates the majority of its HIV sales from its dolutegravir franchise, comprising three-drug regimens — Triumeq and Tivicay — and two-drug regimens — Dovato and J&amp;J-partnered Juluca. The launch of the two-drug regimens has been eroding sales and market share of the three-drug regimens following their launch. During the third quarter, GSK and J&amp;J’s Juluca and Dovato generated nearly 35% of total HIV sales, up from 33% in the year-ago quarter.Sales of the dolutegravir franchise were up 1% at CER in the U.S. market and 8% in Europe. In International markets, sales were down 18% at CER.Sales of Triumeq declined 16% at CER, while Tivicay sales fell 13% at CER. The combined sales of Dovato and J&amp;J-partnered Juluca gained 40% at CER. Sales of Rukobia, Cabenuva and Apretude also contributed to growth. Overall, the new HIV drugs gained 64% at CER.Sales of the immuno-inflammation drug, Benlysta, were up 15% in the quarter, reflecting growth across all regions.Sales of the respiratory drug, Nucala, were up 18% at CER during the quarter, driven by growth in all markets.Oncology sales were up 19% year over year, mainly driven by Zejula. Sales of Zejula rose 11% in the quarter. Sales of the drug, Blenrep, gained 32% during the quarter. The recently-launched Jemperli added £8 million to the top line in the third quarter.Sales of General Medicines were up 1%. Loss of sales from established drugs due to generic competition was offset by the strong sales growth of respiratory drugs Trelegy Ellipta and Revlar/Breo Ellipta and the post-pandemic recovery of Augmentin sales. A few established drugs like Avamys and Flixotide also demonstrated sales growth.Trelegy Ellipta sales surged 28% year over year, driven by strong growth in all regions. Sales of Anoro Ellipta declined 8% at CER during the third quarter. Key established drugs Advair/Seretide sales declined 23% year over year due to generic competition in all markets. Sales on Revlar/Breo Ellipta were up 11% at CER year over year.Vaccine Sales RiseGSK’s third-quarter vaccine sales gained 5% at CER, mainly driven by the recovery in Shingrix sales.Shingrix sales rose 36% at CER during the quarter due to strong demand in Europe and International markets. Presently, the vaccine is available across 25 countries.In Meningitis vaccines, Bexsero sales were up 15%, while sales of Menveo rose 14%. Sales of the influenza vaccine, Fluarix, decline 7% at CER. Sales of Established vaccines were down 2% year over year.Operating ExpensesAdjusted selling, general and administration (SG&amp;A) costs increased 12% year over year at CER to £1.97 billion. The increase in SG&amp;A costs was due to the launch of products in the Specialty Medicines and Vaccines segments.Research and development (R&amp;D) expenses rose 8% year over year at CER to reach £1.3 billion due to continued investment by the company in mRNA technology and recently acquired Affinivax.2022 GuidanceGSK raised its guidance for 2022. The company expects sales to increase 8% to 10% in 2022, up from the previously guided range of 6% to 8%. The guidance excludes any revenues from its COVID-related products. Management also expects a declining trend in sales of COVID-related products.Shares of GSK moved up 2% in pre-market trading on Nov 2, likely due to the increased guidance for sales. GSK’s shares have lost 39.3% so far this year compared to the industry’s 21.9% fall.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchGSK expects sales of specialty drugs to increase low double-digit percentage at CER in 2022, while vaccine sales are expected to grow in the mid to high-teens percentage at CER for this year. The company expects strong double-digit growth for Shingrix in 2022. GSK expects broadly flat year-over-year sales growth for the General Medicines segment due to increased generic erosion of respiratory drugs.The company expects operating profit growth to now increase between 15% to 17% at CER, up from the previous guidance of 13-15%. The company continued to maintain its guidance for adjusted EPS, which is anticipated to grow around 1% lower than operating profits.For the fourth quarter, management expects to record stronger sales growth and incur higher R&amp;D expenses.GSK PLC Sponsored ADR Price GSK PLC Sponsored ADR PriceGSK PLC Sponsored ADR price | GSK PLC Sponsored ADR Quote Zacks RankGSK currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

It added that it was looking into possible causes.Swissmedic had temporarily approved the booster shot in early October, but said it was too early to approve the bivalent booster targeting the currently circulating BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron subvariants in addition to the original virus, which is being used in the United States despite less available data.A BioNTech spokesperson said Pfizer was in charge of the supply chain and distribution in Switzerland and had no further immediate comment.

All three major indexes ended in negative territory.How Did The Benchmarks Perform?The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) slipped 0.2% or 79.75 points to finish at 32,653.20 points.The S&amp;P 500 dropped 0.4% or 15.88 points to end at 3,856.10 points. Tech and consumer discretionary stocks were the biggest losers.The Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR (XLY) declined 1%, while the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) lost 0.8%. The Energy Select Sector SPDR (XLE) gained 1%. Six of the 11 sectors of the benchmark index ended in negative territory.The tech-heavy Nasdaq slid 0.9% or 97.30 points to close at 10,890.85 points.The fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) was down 0.27% to 25.81. Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a 1.56-to-1 ratio. On Nasdaq, a 1.29-to-1 ratio favored advancing issues. A total of 11.11 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 11.45 billion.Investors Worried Ahead of Fed’s Rate HikeThe Dow ended 14% higher last month to record its best monthly percentage gain since 1976 and its best October performance ever. The S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq also made a solid rebound in October, finishing the month in green. However, the rally seems to have come to a halt ahead of the Fed’s two-day policy meeting.On Tuesday, investors’ spirits were dampened as economic data showed solid U.S. job openings in September, which came in above expectations. The impressive economic data didn’t work in favor of the markets as investors now fear that it will prevent the Fed from going slow on its aggressive rate-hike policy in its fight to control surging inflation.Story continuesEconomic data released last week hinted at inflation easing. This made investors believe that the expected 75-basis point hike might be the last of the job rate hikes by the Fed and it might signal a smaller size of rate hikes or pauses its hikes in the coming months.However, the hopes were dimmed following the release of the data on Tuesday. Tech stocks were once again one of the biggest losers on Tuesday. Shares of Salesforce, Inc. CRM declined 1.7%, while Netflix, Inc. NFLX fell 1.8%.The third-quarter earnings season has been mixed so far.However, some of the losses were pared on Tuesday with Pfizer Inc. PFE both reporting impressive quarterly results. Pfizer reported third-quarter 2022 earnings of $1.78 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.47 per share. Pfizer has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Shares of Uber Technologies, Inc. UBER jumped 12% after the company reported third-quarter 2022 revenues of $8.34 billion, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.08 billion.Economic DataThe Labor Department said on Tuesday that U.S. job openings increased to 10.7 million in September, up from 10.3 million in the previous month. Economists had expected job openings to drop below 10 million.In other economic data, the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing index declined 0.7% points to 50.2 in October, its lowest level since May 2020. However, construction spending unexpectedly rose 0.2% in September to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,811.1 billion.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

278,69301f54-3088-3bc5-9200-ade93531e0d6,PFE,2022-11-03,3 Top-Ranked Dividend Stocks: A Smarter Way to Boost Your Retirement Income,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-top-ranked-dividend-stocks-131001312.html,1667394601,STORY,['PFE'],"[Believe it or not, seniors fear running out of cash more than they fear dying.And unfortunately, even retirees who have built a nest egg have good reason to be concerned - with the traditional approaches to retirement planning, income may no longer cover expenses. That means retirees are dipping into principal to make ends meet, setting up a race against time between dwindling investment balances and longer lifespans.Your parents' retirement investing plan won't cut it today.For many years, bonds or other fixed-income assets could produce the yield needed to provide solid income for retirement needs. However, these yields have dwindled over time: 10-year Treasury bond rates in the late 1990s were around 6.50%, but today, that rate is a thing of the past, with a slim likelihood of rates making a comeback in the foreseeable future.While this yield reduction may not seem drastic, it adds up: for a $1 million investment in 10-year Treasuries, the rate drop means a difference in yield of more than $1 million.And lower bond yields aren't the only potential problem seniors are facing. Today's retirees aren't feeling as secure as they once did about Social Security, either. Benefit checks will still be coming for the foreseeable future, but based on current estimates, Social Security funds will run out of money in 2035.So what's a retiree to do? You could cut your expenses to the bone, and take the risk that your Social Security checks don't shrink. Or you could find an alternative investment that provides a steady, higher-rate income stream to replace dwindling bond yields.Invest in Dividend StocksAs we see it, dividend-paying stocks from generally low-risk, top notch companies are a brilliant way to create steady and solid income streams to supplant low risk, low yielding Treasury and fixed-income alternatives.Look for stocks that have paid steady, increasing dividends for years (or decades), and have not cut their dividends even during recessions.Story continuesOne way to identify suitable candidates is to look for stocks with an average dividend yield of 3%, and positive average annual dividend growth. Many stocks increase dividends over time, helping to offset the effects of inflation.Here are three dividend-paying stocks retirees should consider for their nest egg portfolio.Bar Harbor Bankshares (BHB) is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.26 per share, with a dividend yield of 3.51%. This compares to the Banks - Northeast industry's yield of 2.34% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.67%. The company's annualized dividend growth in the past year was 8.33%. Check Bar Harbor Bankshares (BHB) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;OceanFirst Financial (OCFC) is paying out a dividend of $0.2 per share at the moment, with a dividend yield of 3.53% compared to the Financial - Savings and Loan industry's yield of 2.43% and the S&amp;P 500's yield. The annualized dividend growth of the company was 17.65% over the past year. Check OceanFirst Financial (OCFC) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;Currently paying a dividend of $0.4 per share, Pfizer (PFE) has a dividend yield of 3.33%. This is compared to the Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry's yield of 2.63% and the S&amp;P 500's current yield. Annualized dividend growth for the company in the past year was 2.56%. Check Pfizer (PFE) dividend history here&gt;&gt;&gt;But aren't stocks generally more risky than bonds?Yes, that's true. As a broad category, bonds carry less risk than stocks. However, the stocks we are talking about - dividend -paying stocks from high-quality companies - can generate income over time and also mitigate the overall volatility of your portfolio compared to the stock market as a whole.An advantage of owning dividend stocks for your retirement nest egg is that numerous companies, particularly blue chip stocks, raise their dividends over time, helping alleviate the impact of inflation on your potential retirement income.Thinking about dividend-focused mutual funds or ETFs? Watch out for fees.If you prefer investing in funds or ETFs compared to individual stocks, you can still pursue a dividend income strategy. However, it's important to know the fees charged by each fund or ETF, which can ultimately reduce your dividend income, working against your strategy. Do your homework and make sure you know the fees charged by any fund before you invest.Bottom LineRegardless of whether you select high-quality, low-fee funds or stocks, looking for a steady stream of income from dividend-paying equities can potentially lead you to a solid and more peaceful retirement.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Insiders invest with the hopes of seeing their money grow in value over time. However, as a result of recent losses, their initial investment is now only worth US$3.8m, which is not what they expected.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for PayPal Holdings PayPal Holdings Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Executive Vice President of Global Sales, Peggy Alford, sold US$2.1m worth of shares at a price of US$97.82 per share. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$79.45). So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. Peggy Alford was the only individual insider to sell over the last year.Over the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 47.46k shares worth US$6.4m. But they sold 21.79k shares for US$2.1m. Overall, PayPal Holdings insiders were net buyers during the last year. Their average price was about US$136. I'd consider this a positive as it suggests insiders see value at around the current price. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeThere are always plenty of stocks that insiders are buying. So if that suits your style you could check each stock one by one or you could take a look at this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).Story continuesPayPal Holdings Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at PayPal Holdings. In total, Executive Vice President of Global Sales Peggy Alford dumped US$2.1m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Does PayPal Holdings Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It's great to see that PayPal Holdings insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$113m. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.So What Does This Data Suggest About PayPal Holdings Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. But we take heart from prior transactions. And insider ownership remains quite considerable. So the recent selling doesn't worry us.

Despite being one of the largest online payment solution providers, the stock has been far from immune to challenges in the economy.PayPal’s stock began to falter before increased operating headwinds and rising inflation. During Q1 last year, Wall Street began to question if the company could sustain its impressive growth. Increasing competition from Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Wallet among other alternative payment solution sources started to wear on investor sentiment surrounding the premium paid for PYPL stock. Block SQ and many of the big banks have also become respectable competitors.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchOverviewPayPal, previously Confinity, was founded in 1998 and went public in 2002. The company was bought by eBay EBAY shortly after. PayPal is a pioneer in innovating the way consumers can pay for online products. Before PayPal’s services, many payments on retail sites like eBay were being paid by checks and money orders, causing delays for products to be delivered while waiting for checks to be cleared.In 2014, Wall Street juggernaut and large shareholder Carl Icahn demanded the company split from eBay. This resulted in the company again operating as a single, publicly-traded company the following year. PYPL’s growth continued to accelerate after acquiring Xoom in 2015 which expanded its business internationally.Recently, PYPL’s growth has started to slow making management of the current economic downturn a pivotal moment for the company. Last quarter, revenue grew 9% to $6.8 billion. PYPL beat earnings expectations by 9% at $0.93 per share. This caused the stock to spike 13% the following day. However, earnings were still down 19% from $1.15 in Q2 2021. Wall Street will be monitoring if the company was able to close the gap during Q3. Story continuesQ3 OutlookThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for PYPL’s Q3 earnings is $0.95 per share, which would represent a -14% decline from Q3 2021. Sales for Q3 are expected to be up 10% at $6.82 billion. This is an indication that outside of slowing growth, operating costs are weighing on the stock as well.Earnings estimates for the period have remained unchanged throughout the quarter. Year over year, PYPL earnings are expected to decline -14% but rebound and climb 20% in FY23 at $4.75 per share. Top line growth is expected, with sales projected to be up 10% this year and rise another 12% in FY23 to $31.27 billion.Performance &amp; ValuationYear to date, PYPL is down -58% to underperform the S&amp;P 500’s -20% and the Nasdaq’s -33%. PYPL is still up +114% over the last 8 years since operating independently again but still underperformed the benchmark and the Nasdaq.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchInvestors are hoping the company can regain its impressive growth. After reaching 52-week highs of $231.92 last November, PYPL now trades around $79 per share. At current levels, PYPL has a P/E of 28.7X. This is near its peer group’s 29.8X. Even better, PYPL trades nicely below its 8-year high of 87.8X and the median of 44.5X since becoming independent.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchBottom LinePayPal stock could use another strong earnings beat, and stronger than expected guidance could help sustain a rally. Wall Street will want to see if the company can offer any early outlook into FY23 and perhaps confirm what is expected to be a return to growth.PYPL currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and its Internet-Software Industry is in the top 37% of over 250 Zacks Industries. PYPL trades more attractively than it has in the past and long-term investors could be rewarded again for holding the stock. The Average Zacks Price Target suggests 57% upside from current levels.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

PYPL may be one such company. The firm has earnings coming up pretty soon, and events are shaping up quite nicely for their report.That is because PayPal is seeing favorable earnings estimate revision activity as of late, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat. After all, analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a pretty good indicator of some favorable trends underneath the surface for PYPL in this report.In fact, the Most Accurate Estimate for the current quarter is currently at 97 cents per share for PYPL, compared to a broader Zacks Consensus Estimate of 95 cents per share. This suggests that analysts have very recently bumped up their estimates for PYPL, giving the stock a Zacks Earnings ESP of +2.53% heading into earnings season.PayPal Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePayPal Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurprisePayPal Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | PayPal Holdings, Inc.

IBM Business Analytics Enterprise is a suite of business intelligence planning, budgeting, reporting, forecasting, and dashboard capabilities that provides users with a robust view of data sources across their entire business. Along with IBM Planning Analytics with Watson and IBM Cognos Analytics with Watson, this suite also includes a new IBM Analytics Content Hub that helps streamline how users discover and access analytics and planning tools from multiple vendors in a single, personalized dashboard view.IBM Corporation logo. (PRNewsfoto/IBM)According to an August 2022 Forrester report, advanced insights-driven organizations are 1.6x more likely to report using data, analytics, and insights to create experiences, products, and services that differentiate them within the market when compared to beginners1. However, companies are currently facing a highly dynamic operating environment where they must navigate unpredictable events such as supply chain disruptions, labor and skills shortages, evolving regulations, and more. The complexity of storing data across disparate silos can make this more challenging as teams collaborate across different analytics and business intelligence tools. To become data-driven, businesses can differentiate themselves by creating an enterprise-wide strategy that enables them to bring together their tools and put insights into the hands of decision makers.Building on IBM's existing portfolio of business intelligence solutions, IBM Business Analytics Enterprise includes a new IBM Analytics Content Hub. It is designed to allow users to view planning and analytics dashboards from multiple vendors, including tools like IBM Cognos Analytics with Watson, IBM Planning Analytics with Watson, and other common business intelligence tools into a single view that combines elements from each in a dashboard tailored to their unique needs. Additionally, it features algorithms that can recommend role-based content to help users surface new stories, reports, and dashboards from across the organization to aid in decision-making. As more users click through materials within the IBM Analytics Content Hub, the solution analyzes usage patterns to recommend content that aligns with their specific interests.Story continuesNew Capabilities for IBM Cognos Analytics with Watson; IBM Planning Analytics with Watson expected to be available on AWSWith today's news, IBM Cognos Analytics with Watson, an AI-powered business intelligence solution, now also includes new integration capabilities and enhanced forecasting that allows users to consider multiple factors and seasons in their trend predictions. Additionally, IBM Planning Analytics with Watson, an AI-powered solution that helps streamline financial and operational planning, is expected to be available as-a-Service on AWS later this year.IBM Business Analytics Enterprise is designed to help break down silos so that the right teams can get the right data at the right time. For instance, an organization's sales, HR, and operations teams each require access to data and insights from different business intelligence and planning tools for their specific needs, such as optimizing sales goals, building workforce forecasts, or predicting operational capacity. But when it's necessary to share data and reporting across departments, complexities can arise because those teams are using multiple solutions. This can result in duplicate content across applications, which can threaten data consistency and quality. IBM Business Analytics Enterprise helps enterprise data be more easily shared, while remaining protected and avoiding data duplication by giving users across departments a single point of entry to view the data they need.""Businesses today are trying to become more data-driven than ever as they navigate the unexpected in the face of supply chain disruptions, labor and skills shortages and regulatory changes,"" said Dinesh Nirmal, General Manager of Data, AI and Automation, IBM. ""But to truly be data-driven, organizations need to be able to provide their different teams with more comprehensive access to analytics tools and a more complete picture of their business data, without jeopardizing their compliance, security or privacy programs. IBM Business Analytics Enterprise offers a way to bring together analytics tools in a single view, regardless of which vendor it comes from or where the data resides.""ALH Gruppe is a leading finance and insurance company in Germany, and with thousands of employees who need access to data insights, the majority of whom are not data scientists or highly technical users, they sought a solution to help streamline their data infrastructure even more.""We've been using IBM Cognos Analytics with Watson for well over a decade now to support decision-making of all kinds across our business. We frequently use it in conjunction with other business intelligence tools, and one challenge was that those tools were always standing side-by-side with no connection between them and the data was separated,"" said Bernd Oerthle, Head of Analytics Reporting and Infrastructure, ALH Gruppe. ""With the new IBM Analytics Content Hub, we plan to connect internal stakeholders to multiple different BI solutions for easy access to self-service data, enabling better support for our end customers.""The launch of Business Analytics Enterprise further builds on IBM's strategy to provide businesses with tools to support data-driven decision-making.

ACLS is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 2, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 28.2%. It pulled off a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 25%, on average.The Beverly, MA-based company is expected to have recorded year-over-year higher revenues on the back of healthy demand trends.Factors at PlayDuring the to-be-reported quarter, Axcelis increased the production capacity level at its new Asia Operations Center in Pyeongtaek-Si, Gyeonggi-Do, Korea. The higher production is likely to have enabled the company to better serve the Korean customer base while expanding its footprint across Asia.

The products, primarily used in high volume production of power devices, are likely to have generated incremental revenues in the third quarter supporting automotive device markets.For the September quarter, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $224 million, which indicates growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure of $177 million. Management expects third-quarter revenues within $220-$228 million.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Over the past month, shares of this company have returned +9.9%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, which General Motors Company falls in, has lost 8.8%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.General Motors Company is expected to post earnings of $1.58 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.9%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.91 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -2.3%. This estimate has changed +3.5% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.25 indicates a change of -9.6% from what General Motors Company is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.9%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for General Motors Company.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GM _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of General Motors Company, the consensus sales estimate of $41.64 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +24%. The $154.79 billion and $161.69 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +21.9% and +4.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGeneral Motors Company reported revenues of $41.89 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +56.4%. EPS of $2.25 for the same period compares with $1.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $41.83 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.13%. The EPS surprise was +19.05%.Over the last four quarters, General Motors Company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.General Motors Company is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about General Motors Company. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Looking at the history of these trends, perhaps none is more beloved than value investing. This strategy simply looks to identify companies that are being undervalued by the broader market. Value investors use fundamental analysis and traditional valuation metrics to find stocks that they believe are being undervalued by the market at large.In addition to the Zacks Rank, investors looking for stocks with specific traits can utilize our Style Scores system. Of course, value investors will be most interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with ""A"" grades for Value and high Zacks Ranks are among the best value stocks available at any given moment.SkyWest (SKYW) is a stock many investors are watching right now. SKYW is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy) and an A for Value. The stock has a Forward P/E ratio of 11.85. This compares to its industry's average Forward P/E of 16.17. SKYW's Forward P/E has been as high as 4,094.79 and as low as -25,372.15, with a median of 13.58, all within the past year.Value investors also use the P/S ratio. The P/S ratio is is calculated as price divided by sales. Some people prefer this metric because sales are harder to manipulate on an income statement. This means it could be a truer performance indicator. SKYW has a P/S ratio of 0.29. This compares to its industry's average P/S of 0.5.Investors could also keep in mind United Airlines (UAL), an Transportation - Airline stock with a Zacks Rank of # 2 (Buy) and Value grade of A.Furthermore, United Airlines holds a P/B ratio of 2.87 and its industry's price-to-book ratio is 4.26. UAL's P/B has been as high as 4.68, as low as 2.01, with a median of 3 over the past 12 months.Value investors will likely look at more than just these metrics, but the above data helps show that SkyWest and United Airlines are likely undervalued currently.

311,422afbfb-b866-3323-98b2-ee156d33e157,PNW,2022-11-03,Pinnacle West Reports Lower 2022 Third-Quarter Results,Business Wire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/pinnacle-west-reports-lower-2022-124000128.html,1667479200,STORY,['PNW'],"[Quarterly results buoyed by strong operational performance, warmer weather than a year agoEmployees ensure reliable customer service despite damaging monsoon seasonAPS among most improved utilities for residential and business customer satisfactionPHOENIX, November 03, 2022--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (NYSE: PNW) today reported consolidated net income attributable to common shareholders for the 2022 third quarter of $326.3 million, or $2.88 per diluted share. This result compares with net income of $339.8 million, or $3.00 per share, for the same period a year ago.Like the first two quarters of 2022, the company’s lower third-quarter results reflect the unfavorable outcome of the company’s prior rate case, which was implemented on Dec. 1, 2021. As a result of that rate decision, the Company is no longer deferring costs related to the Four Corners selective catalytic reduction (SCR) and Ocotillo modernization projects to a regulatory asset. These costs are now reflected in the income statement and result in a reduction in net income.Other factors negatively affecting the 2022 third-quarter results were lower revenue driven by the inability to continue using alternative revenue accounting treatment for the lost fixed cost recovery (LFCR) mechanism; higher depreciation and amortization expense due to increased plant assets and updated depreciation rates; and higher operations and maintenance expense. These negative factors were partially offset by warmer weather than a year ago; customer growth of 2.0 percent; increased retail sales of 1.3 percent; and lower income taxes.""During the quarter, our employees continued to do what they do best: maintain reliable electric service for our 1.3 million customers despite monsoon storms that created damaging winds, heavy rains and flash flooding,"" said Pinnacle West Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Guldner. ""Our workforce safely and quickly restored service to customers after multiple volatile summer storms toppled a combined 811 poles – 255 more poles than the prior three summers combined.""Story continuesGuldner noted the company’s generation fleet also operated well. In particular, Palo Verde Generating Station – the nation’s largest energy producer, all carbon-free – recorded a summer capacity factor of 100.2% – its highest figure since tracking began in 2010.""Our careful long-term planning, resource adequacy, flexibility and innovative programs proved beneficial to our customers throughout the summer,"" he said, adding that the company also was able to assist neighboring utilities during an early-September heatwave that resulted in 15 energy emergency declarations by others across the West. ""Those off-system sales directly benefit APS customers by lowering our overall costs while helping maintain regional grid stability.""APS Commitment to Customer Satisfaction Reflected in Latest J.D. Power ResultsDelivering value to Arizona Public Service (APS) customers went beyond just keeping lights on and air-conditioners running through the summer season. J.D. Power’s (JDP) 2022 third-quarter residential results also reflected APS’s commitment to improving customers’ overall experience.Compared to 2021, APS has made quartile gains in every single driver of residential customer satisfaction. Consequently, overall satisfaction is now well above industry benchmarks when compared to the company’s large investor-owned peers. This improvement places the company firmly into the second quartile for residential customer satisfaction. APS’s strongest performing drivers through the first three quarters of 2022 were Customer Care (phone and digital), Power Quality and Reliability, Corporate Citizenship, and Billing &amp; Payment. Additionally, JDP’s Business 2022 mid-year results place the company in the first quartile nationally for business customers.""There’s no doubt in my mind that creating customer value is inseparably linked to increasing shareholder value,"" Guldner said. ""Our team has embraced this customer-centric focus to achieve an industry-leading customer experience, while demonstrating compassion and advocacy for our customers. As a result, our employees’ commitment and focus has led to APS being among the most improved utilities in the nation for both residential and business customer satisfaction.""A Look to the FutureLooking forward, Guldner said, ""We are creating long-term value for customers and shareholders by executing our strategy of operational excellence and sound capital investment to meet the energy needs of one of the fastest growing regions in the country. Additionally, disciplined cost management remains a central theme at the company and – along with our recent rate case filing – is a key to future earnings improvement.""Filed last week, the company’s general rate case will focus on a return to balanced ratemaking, which will enable the company to make responsible and necessary investments to meet the needs of its customers – today and in the future. These investments include:Ensuring service reliability and resilience;Securing a clean, balanced energy supply for Arizona; andContinuously improving support for all customers, including expanded bill assistance programs for those who need additional support.Financial OutlookGiven the positive year-to-date impacts of beneficial weather, strong sales and customer growth, the company increased its 2022 consolidated earnings guidance range to $4.20 to $4.35 per diluted share from a previously disclosed range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share.

An improvement in economic conditions after the pandemic has been generating fresh demand for utility services.Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Zacks Utilities sector’s third-quarter 2022 earnings are expected to decline 9.3% while revenues are estimated to improve 3%. The capital-intensive utility stocks were impacted by the ongoing increase in interest rates and rising operating costs, while new rates implemented in their service territories boosted revenues.Factors to ConsiderDomestic-focused companies operating in the sector are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure is allowing the utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation.Per the updated outlook of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the July-September 2022 average contiguous U.S. temperature was 73.0°F, 2.8°F above average. The above-average temperature during the summer months is likely to have spurred demand for water and electricity for cooling purposes, benefiting the utilities.A clear transition is evident in the Utilities space, with companies operating in this space gradually moving toward clean sources of fuel to produce electricity and lower emission. The stringent regulation of emissions, the high cost of conventional fuel and government incentives on the usage of clean fuel are also urging the utilities to focus more on clean energy sources. Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades.Utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, and are capital-intensive in nature. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels. The increase in borrowing costs and the possibility of more interest rate hikes this year may have further pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted earnings.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

313,7958f7e8-e006-36ab-a119-2e1e3fee1ff5,TGT,2022-11-03,"Target Corporation's (NYSE:TGT) recent 3.9% pullback adds to one-year year losses, institutional owners may take drastic measures",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/target-corporations-nyse-tgt-recent-110111880.html,1667473271,STORY,['TGT'],"[A look at the shareholders of Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) can tell us which group is most powerful. With 80% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$3.0b. The recent loss, which adds to a one-year loss of 37% for stockholders, may not sit well with this group of investors. Often called “market makers”, institutions wield significant power in influencing the price dynamics of any stock. As a result, if the decline continues, institutional investors may be pressured to sell Target which might hurt individual investors.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Target, beginning with the chart below. View our latest analysis for Target ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Target?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.Target already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Target's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Target. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.2%. Meanwhile, the second and third largest shareholders, hold 8.4% and 7.2%, of the shares outstanding, respectively.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.Insider Ownership Of TargetWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Target Corporation. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$164m of stock. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipWith a 20% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Target. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Target has   4 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

To jump ahead to the top five companies in this list, head on over to 5 Biggest E-Commerce Companies In USA.Courtesy of the Internet and consumer technology, populations of today have access to a wide variety of services and products right at their fingertips. The smartphone and the personal computer enable consumers to browse through countless products while sitting at home and have them delivered directly without the hassle of going to stores and physically sifting through products.This has led to massive growth in electronic commerce over the past decade and enabled retailers, such as Amazon, to become trillion dollar firms. These valuations are also supported by market research. For instance, a research report from Reports and Insights believes that the e-commerce market will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.9% from 2022 to 2030, and from its current value of $48 billion to a massive $117.7 billion by the end of the forecast period. The report outlines that machine learning, cloud computing, and 3G and 4G connectivity will drive this growth - as sellers use the advanced technologies to optimize their customer offerings and the connectivity platforms enable more people to connect to the Internet.Another report, this time from Spherical Insights, places an even more optimistic CAGR of 14.3% on the e-commerce sector. It wagers that the industry was worth $810 billion last year and will grow through the aforementioned CAGR to sit at a whopping $1.9 trillion by the end of 2030. Some of the latest trends in the sector, according to the firm, are companies offering novel experiences such as streaming and gaming on their platform, combined with artificial intelligence and voice search to improve cataloging.Today's piece will focus on the largest American e-commerce companies, with the top picks being Amazon.com, Inc.

Here is what the fund said:In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”Along with Amazon.com, Inc.

Third quarter results were better than expected and above guidance for the quarter mainly due to higher load factors from strong close-in demand, further improvement in onboard revenue and better cost performance. The Group also introduced the Trifecta Program, a new three-year initiative designed to drive superior performance.""Last quarter's better than expected performance was a result of the continued robust demand environment and strong execution by our teams,"" said Jason Liberty, president and chief executive officer of Royal Caribbean Group. ""The combination of our leading global brands, the best and most innovative fleet in the industry, our nimble global sourcing platform and the very best people have delivered a successful return of our business to full operations and positions us well to deliver record yields and adjusted EBITDA in 2023,"" added Liberty. ""The Trifecta Program provides us the financial coordinates we are looking to achieve over the next three years. As we have demonstrated in the past, we expect the formula of moderate yield growth, strong cost discipline, and moderate growth of our fleet will deliver a strong financial profile.""Business HighlightsLoad factors in the third quarter were 96% overall, with Caribbean sailings reaching almost 105%.Total Revenue in the third quarter was $3.0 billion, Net Income was $33.0 million and Adjusted EBITDA was $742.3 million.Booking volumes in the third quarter accelerated versus the second quarter of 2022 and remained significantly higher than booking volumes received in the third quarter of 2019 for all future sailings.For 2023, all quarters are currently booked well within historical ranges at record pricing.During the third quarter, the company addressed $5.6 billion of its 2022 and 2023 debt maturities, resulting in $0.1 billion and $2.1 billion of maturities remaining in 2022 and 2023, respectively.Based on continued strength in consumer demand and typical load factor seasonality, the company expects fourth quarter load factors to be similar to third quarter overall, and to reach triple digits by year-end.For the fourth quarter of 2022, based on current currency exchange rates, fuel rates and interest rates, the company expects to generate Total Revenue of approximately $2.6 billion, Adjusted EBITDA of $350 - $400 million and Adjusted Loss per Share of ($1.30) – ($1.50).The Trifecta Program is designed to achieve three important financial goals by the end of 2025: increasing Adjusted EBITDA per APCD to triple digits, increasing Adjusted EPS to double digits, and achieving ROIC in the teens, while in parallel returning to an investment grade profile and reducing carbon intensity by double digits as compared to 2019.Story continuesThird Quarter 2022The company reported Net Income for the third quarter of $33.0 million or $0.13 per share compared to Net Loss of $(1.4) billion or $(5.59) per share for the same period in the prior year. The company also reported Adjusted Net Income of $65.8 million or $0.26 per share for the third quarter compared to Adjusted Net Loss of $(1.2) billion or $(4.91) per share for the same period in the prior year.Third quarter load factors were 96% overall and almost 105% for Caribbean Sailings. As expected, total revenues per passenger cruise day were flat as reported and up 1% in constant currency versus the third quarter of 2019 despite the negative impact from the redemption of future cruise certificates (FCCs) and lower than average load factors on high priced Europe itineraries.Gross Cruise Costs per APCD increased 1% as reported and in constant currency, compared to the second quarter 2022. Net Cruise Costs (NCC), excluding fuel, per APCD improved 11% as reported and 10% in constant currency, compared to the second quarter of 2022. Gross Cruise Costs per APCD and NCC, excluding fuel, per APCD for the third quarter included $3.37 per APCD related to health protocols and one-time lagging costs related to fleet ramp up.NCC, excluding fuel, per APCD for the fourth quarter is expected to be higher by low to mid-single digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, all on a constant currency basis. The company still expects to have transitory costs in the fourth quarter, but are expected to normalize as the company is nearing full occupancies, full crew staffing levels, and adapting protocols. The improvement is partially offset by inflationary and supply chain challenges, mainly related to fuel and food costs, that are expected to continue to weigh on costs through the rest of this year and through the first half of 2023.Update on Bookings Booking volumes in the third quarter were significantly higher than the corresponding period in 2019. This improvement in bookings was helped by the easing of testing and vaccination protocols which now align more closely with the broader travel industry, allowing everyone to enjoy a cruise vacation.Guests continue to make their cruise reservations closer to sailing than in the past, resulting in about 50% more bookings in the third quarter for current year sailings when compared to the third quarter of 2019.While 2022 bookings remain strong and on pace to achieve occupancy targets, the most notable change has been a substantial acceleration in demand for 2023 sailings. Booking volumes for 2023 doubled during the third quarter when compared to the second quarter and were considerably higher than bookings for 2020 sailings during the comparable period in 2019, the highest in company history.As of September 30, 2022, the Group's customer deposit balance was $3.8 billion, reflecting typical seasonality as peak summer sailing deposits have been recognized in revenue. In the third quarter, approximately 95% of total bookings were new versus FCC redemptions.Trifecta ProgramThe Trifecta Program is a three-year financial performance initiative designed to chart out the pathway back to superior performance with three main goals to be achieved by the end of 2025:Triple Digit Adjusted EBITDA per APCD, to exceed prior record Adjusted EBITDA per APCD of $87 in 2019.Double Digit Adjusted Earnings per Share to exceed the prior record Adjusted Earnings per Share of $9.54 in 2019.Return on Invested Capital (""ROIC"") in the teens to exceed the prior record ROIC of 10.5% in 2019 through optimizing capital allocation and enhancing operating income.…all while returning to an investment grade profile and reducing carbon intensity by double digits compared to 2019.To achieve these goals, the company expects to execute its proven formula of moderate capacity growth, moderate yield growth, and strong cost controls, all while ensuring disciplined capital allocation, investing in the future and improving the balance sheet.""Our brands, vacation offerings and fleet have never been stronger and we are well positioned for continued step change in financial performance,"" said Liberty. ""Our proven formula for success is unchanged as we grow capacity and, enhance profitability while seeking to deliver superior shareholder return.""Liquidity and Financing ArrangementsAs of September 30, 2022, the Group's liquidity position was $3.1 billion, which includes cash and cash equivalents, undrawn revolving credit facility capacity, and a $700 million commitment for a 364-day term loan facility.During the third quarter, the company took proactive actions to address $5.6 billion of 2022 and 2023 maturities, in addition to securing financing for the Silversea Endeavour acquisition:In August, the company issued $1.15 billion of 6.00% convertible notes due 2025 and used the proceeds to repurchase $800 million of its 4.25% convertible notes maturing June 2023 and $350 million of its 2.875% convertible notes maturing November 2023;In August, the company issued $1.25 billion of 11.625% unsecured notes due 2027 to refinance 2022 and 2023 debt maturities;In August, the company extended its existing commitment from Morgan Stanley for a $700 million delay draw term loan facility to August 2023;In September, the company amended its $554 million Term Loan (due October 2023) such that the aggregate outstanding principal balance is $502 million, with $30.0 million maturing in October 2023 and $472 million maturing in October 2024.In September, the company priced $1.0 billion 8.25% secured notes and $1.0 billion 9.25% guaranteed notes, both due 2029 and callable in 2025 to refinance $1.0 billion of secured notes and $1.0 billion of guaranteed notes, both due June 2023. The transaction closed in October.""During the third quarter, we took a series of proactive actions to methodically address a significant amount of our 2022 and 2023 debt maturities,"" said Naftali Holtz, chief financial officer, Royal Caribbean Group. ""Our strong near term liquidity enables us to focus on continuing to improve the balance sheet as we seek to return to an investment grade profile.""In September, the company repaid its $650 million 5.25% bond due November 2022 utilizing proceeds from the unsecured offering completed in August 2022.The company noted that as of September 30, 2022 and reflecting the intended use of proceeds from the recent issuances to repay debt (certain of which occurred in October 2022), the scheduled debt maturities for the remainder of 2022, 2023, 2024, 2025 and 2026 were $0.1 billion, $2.1 billion, $4.6 billion, $3.7 billion and $2.7 billion, respectively.Fuel ExpenseBunker pricing, net of hedging, for the third quarter was $777 per metric ton and consumption was 407,000 metric tons.As of the date of this release, fuel consumption is 64% hedged via swaps for the remainder of 2022 and 50% hedged for 2023 below market prices.

Fourth quarter load factors are expected to average approximately 95% overall.The company does not forecast fuel rates, and fuel cost calculations are based on current at-the-pump prices, net of hedging impacts. Based on current fuel rates, the company expects fuel expense in the fourth quarter to be in the range of $282 — $292 million, at an average pricing of $710 per metric ton, net of hedging.NCC, excluding fuel, per APCD in the fourth quarter of 2022 is expected to increase by low to mid-single digits compared to the fourth quarter of 2019, all on a constant currency basis.

We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.DefinitionsSelected Operational and Financial MetricsAdjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents EBITDA (as defined below) excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our profitability on a comparative basis. For the 2022 and 2021 periods, these items included (i) other income; (ii) impairment and credit losses (recoveries); (iii) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses; (iv) equity investment asset impairments; (v) net insurance recoveries related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the Grand Bahama Shipyard involving Oasis of the Seas; (vi) Pullmantur reorganization settlement; and (vii) the net gain recognized in 2021 in relation to the sale of the Azamara brand.Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per Share (""Adjusted EPS"") is a non-GAAP measure that represents Adjusted Net Income (Loss) (as defined below) divided by weighted average shares outstanding or by diluted weighted average shares outstanding, as applicable. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis.Adjusted Net Income (Loss) is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income (loss) excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our performance on a comparative basis. For the periods presented, these items included (i) impairment and credit losses (recoveries); (ii) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses; (iii) the amortization of the Silversea Cruises intangible assets resulting from the Silversea Cruises acquisition in 2018; (iv) gain or loss on the extinguishment of debt; (v) the amortization of non-cash debt discount on our convertible notes; (vi) the estimated cash refunds expected to be paid to Pullmantur guests as part of the Pullmantur S.A. reorganization in 2020; (vii) equity investment asset impairments; (viii) net insurance recoveries related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the Grand Bahama Shipyard involving Oasis of the Seas; and (ix) the net gain recognized in 2021 in relation to the sale of the Azamara brand.Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) is a non-GAAP measure that represents operating income (loss) including income (loss) from equity investments and income taxes but excluding certain items that we believe adjusting for is meaningful when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis. For the 2019 period, these items included (i) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses; (ii) the amortization of the Silversea Cruises intangible assets resulting from the Silversea Cruises acquisition in 2018; (iii) transaction and integration costs related to the 2018 Silversea Cruises acquisition; (iv) incidental costs, net of insurance recoveries, related to the collapse of the drydock structure at the Grand Bahama Shipyard involving Oasis of the Seas; and (v) Grand Bahama drydock write-off and other incidental expenses, included within our equity investment income. We use this non-GAAP measure to calculate ROIC (as defined below).Available Passenger Cruise Days (""APCD"") is our measurement of capacity and represents double occupancy per cabin multiplied by the number of cruise days for the period, which excludes canceled cruise days and cabins not available for sale. We use this measure to perform capacity and rate analysis to identify our main non-capacity drivers that cause our cruise revenue and expenses to vary.Constant Currency is a significant measure for our revenues and expenses, which are denominated in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. Because our reporting currency is the U.S. Dollar, the value of these revenues and expenses in U.S. Dollar will be affected by changes in currency exchange rates. Although such changes in local currency prices are just one of many elements impacting our revenues and expenses, it can be an important element. For this reason, we also monitor our revenues and expenses in ""Constant Currency"" - i.e., as if the current period's currency exchange rates had remained constant with the comparable prior period's rates. For the 2022 periods presented, we calculate ""Constant Currency"" by applying the average 2019 or Q2 2022 period exchange rates for each of the corresponding months of the reported and/or forecasted period, so as to calculate what the results would have been had exchange rates been the same throughout both periods. We do not make predictions about future exchange rates and use current exchange rates for calculations of future periods. It should be emphasized that the use of Constant Currency is primarily used by us for comparing short-term changes and/or projections. Over the longer term, changes in guest sourcing and shifting the amount of purchases between currencies can significantly change the impact of the purely currency-based fluctuations.EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure that represents net income (loss) excluding (i) interest income; (ii) interest expense, net of interest capitalized; (iii) depreciation and amortization expenses; and (iv) income tax benefit or expense. We believe that this non-GAAP measure is meaningful when assessing our operating performance on a comparative basis.Invested Capital represents the most recent five-quarter average of total debt (i.e., Current portion of long-term debt plus Long-term debt) plus Total shareholders' equity. We use this measure to calculate ROIC (as defined below).Occupancy (""Load Factor""), in accordance with cruise vacation industry practice, is calculated by dividing Passenger Cruise Days (as defined below) by APCD. A percentage in excess of 100% indicates that three or more passengers occupied some cabins.Passenger Cruise Days represent the number of passengers carried for the period multiplied by the number of days of their respective cruises.Carbon Intensity is our measurement of carbon dioxide emissions per gross tonne nautical mile (well-to-wake).Gross Cruise Costs represent the sum of total cruise operating expenses plus marketing, selling and administrative expenses.Net Cruise Costs (""NCC"") and NCC excluding Fuel are non-GAAP measures that represent Gross Cruise Costs excluding commissions, transportation and other expenses and onboard and other expenses and, in the case of Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel, fuel expenses. For the 2022 and 2019 periods presented, Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel exclude (i) restructuring charges and other initiative expenses; (ii) the transaction and integration costs related to the Silversea Cruises acquisition; and (iii) the costs, net of insurance recoveries, related to the Grand Bahama drydock structure incident involving Oasis of the Seas. In measuring our ability to control costs in a manner that positively impacts net income, we believe changes in Net Cruise Costs and Net Cruise Costs excluding Fuel to be the most relevant indicators of our performance.Return on Invested Capital (""ROIC"") represents Adjusted Operating Income (Loss) divided by Invested Capital. We believe ROIC is a meaningful measure because it quantifies how efficiently we generated operating income relative to the capital we have invested in the business. ROIC is also used as a key metric in our long-term incentive compensation program for our executive officers.Trifecta refers to the multi-year Adjusted EBITDA per APCD, Adjusted EPS and ROIC goals we publicly announced in November 2022 and are seeking to achieve by the end of 2025. We designed this program to help us better execute and achieve our business goals by clearly articulating longer-term financial objectives. Under the Trifecta Program, we are targeting Adjusted EBITDA per APCD of at least $100, Adjusted EPS of at least $10, and ROIC of 13% or higher by the end of 2025.For additional information see ""Adjusted Measures of Financial Performance"" below.Adjusted Measures of Financial PerformanceThis press release includes certain adjusted financial measures defined as non-GAAP financial measures under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, which we believe provide useful information to investors as a supplement to our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or U.S. GAAP.The presentation of adjusted financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. These measures may be different from adjusted measures used by other companies. In addition, these adjusted measures are not based on any comprehensive set of accounting rules or principles. Adjusted measures have limitations in that they do not reflect all of the amounts associated with our results of operations as do the corresponding U.S. GAAP measures.A reconciliation to the most comparable U.S. GAAP measure of all adjusted financial measures included in this press release can be found in the tables included at the end of this press release. We have not provided a quantitative reconciliation of the projected non-GAAP financial measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because preparation of meaningful U.S. GAAP projections would require unreasonable effort. Due to significant uncertainty, we are unable to predict, without unreasonable effort, the future movement of foreign exchange rates, fuel prices and interest rates inclusive of our related hedging programs. In addition, we are unable to determine the future impact of non-core business related gains and losses which may result from strategic initiatives. These items are uncertain and could be material to our results of operations in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Due to this uncertainty, we do not believe that reconciling information for such projected figures would be meaningful.ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISES LTD.CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE LOSS(unaudited;

323,d26e3c19-74a8-3b80-9cee-8b7d694395b6,ADI,2022-11-03,Investors in Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI) have made a notable return of 69% over the past five years,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-analog-devices-nasdaq-adi-110038081.html,1667473238,STORY,['ADI'],"[It hasn't been the best quarter for Analog Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADI) shareholders, since the share price has fallen 20% in that time. But the silver lining is the stock is up over five years. However we are not very impressed because the share price is only up 54%, less than the market return of 54%.Now it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business. Check out our latest analysis for Analog Devices There is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.During five years of share price growth, Analog Devices achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 13% per year. The EPS growth is more impressive than the yearly share price gain of 9% over the same period. Therefore, it seems the market has become relatively pessimistic about the company.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthBefore buying or selling a stock, we always recommend a close examination of historic growth trends, available here.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, Analog Devices' TSR for the last 5 years was 69%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveAlthough it hurts that Analog Devices returned a loss of 20% in the last twelve months, the broader market was actually worse, returning a loss of 25%. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 11%, each year, over five years. It could be that the business is just facing some short term problems, but shareholders should keep a close eye on the fundamentals. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Analog Devices better, we need to consider many other factors.

324,45e7c947-1b27-3a6f-ab8e-fd159e10619e,ADI,2022-11-03,Will Analog Devices (ADI) Beat Estimates Again in Its Next Earnings Report?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analog-devices-adi-beat-estimates-161004320.html,1667405404,STORY,['ADI'],"[Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Analog Devices (ADI), which belongs to the Zacks Semiconductor - Analog and Mixed industry.This semiconductor maker has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 8.46%.For the most recent quarter, Analog Devices was expected to post earnings of $2.43 per share, but it reported $2.52 per share instead, representing a surprise of 3.70%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $2.12 per share, while it actually produced $2.40 per share, a surprise of 13.21%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Analog Devices, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Analog Devices has an Earnings ESP of +1.10% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on November 22, 2022.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

325,d129139a-36e3-3c4d-900d-3fdfb84a9a20,RF,2022-11-03,Regions' Tara Plimpton Recognized for DEI Leadership,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/regions-tara-plimpton-recognized-dei-131500400.html,1667481300,STORY,"['RF', 'RF-PB', 'RF-PC', 'RF-PE']","[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / November 3, 2022 / By Candace HigginbothamCorporate Counsel recently announced its 2022 Women, Influence and Power in Law Awards and Regions Chief Legal Officer and Corporate Secretary Tara Plimpton was named a Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Champion.Regions Bank, Thursday, November 3, 2022, Press release pictureThe publication's awards honor general counsel, in-house leaders and law firm partners who have demonstrated a commitment to advancing the empowerment of women in law.""These women leaders are business strategists, complex problem-solvers and, of course, great lawyers. But what particularly makes these women stand out is their personal dedication to the promotion of diversity in the legal industry,"" according to Corporate Counsel's announcement.DEI is a both business priority and a personal mission for Plimpton. And she has instituted several innovative programs in the Legal department since joining the company two years ago.""DEI is a strategic priority at Regions and Tara's work in this area has strengthened the Legal department and enhanced the work of our corporate DEI Center of Expertise,"" said Regions President and CEO John Turner. ""Her commitment reflects our company's mission and values, and I'm pleased she's being recognized for her efforts.""Plimpton described how her DEI journey began, early in her law career. ""I was working on a corporate client's acquisition by one of the world's largest and best-known companies. I was intrigued by the high-performing, diverse team of attorneys I was negotiating with, and I quickly realized that those attorneys were thriving not only because the team was diverse, but because of the diversity of thought, diversity of experience and diversity of background.""When the acquisition was completed, Plimpton was approached by the buyer, General Electric, to join their in-house legal team. She jumped at the opportunity and spent 18 years at the company, where her DEI focus continued. At GE, she co-led a team that organized more than 10,000 mentoring groups globally. Plimpton also sponsored the Women's Network for the legal department and for GE's Energy business. She worked to build diverse teams to ensure that all voices were heard and opportunities for success were available to everyone.Story continuesFast forward to 2020: Just a short time after joining Regions and moving to Birmingham, the murder of George Floyd rocked the country - and her new Legal team. Plimpton's longer-term DEI strategy gained more urgency, and she began immediately having conversations and implementing several new DEI initiatives within the Legal department.She worked with the department's Culture &amp; Equity team to launch a community engagement series, ""Birmingham Stands Together,"" to drive progress in DEI efforts across the greater community.Under Plimpton's leadership, the program's first event gathered DEI leaders from across the Birmingham legal community to engage, share, ideas, and take steps to bring about progress in this vital area. More than 75 attendees participated, including law firm management and DEI leaders, corporate in-house counsel, and other company personnel charged with executing DEI initiatives.Following the successful debut Plimpton hosted a second event, a panel discussion where she and co-host Andrew Nix, Chief Governance Officer and chair of the Legal department's Culture &amp; Equity team, engaged Alabama law school deans in a powerful conversation on the history of racism and the future of the talent pipeline in the profession.The most recent gathering, held in June 2022, featured local and state bar association leaders in a discussion about how the organizations are contributing to diversity, equity and inclusion in the legal community.""We can do more if we do it together,"" Plimpton said. ""Getting local legal leaders together will help all of us ensure our profession is taking steps to make meaningful progress toward a more diverse, equitable and inclusive environment.""Additionally, Plimpton has prioritized community engagement, including overseeing programs that provide financial education to inmates at an Alabama women's prison and building a playground for the Boys &amp; Girls Club. The department has also launched an internship program in partnership with several firms for local diverse law students.Plimpton's emphasis on DEI is also visible in her day-to-day management of the Legal team.The Legal team is currently pursuing Mansfield Rule Legal Department certification, which is modeled after the Mansfield Rule for law firms, a well-known national movement to increase diversity in legal recruitment and promotion practices.Staff meetings feature ongoing dialogue that includes exposure to diverse voices and an examination of the legal and workplace issues surrounding diversity. For example, they've re-examined historical civil rights cases and interviewed surviving parties and the filmmakers who covered them. Another example included a frank discussion on the LGBTQ+ advocacy landscape and best practices for supporting and serving the LGBTQ+ community.""We in the Legal department are so fortunate to have a leader like Tara who has made diversity, equity and inclusion a priority area of focus,"" said Andrew Nix, Chief Governance Officer and Chair of the Legal Department's Culture &amp; Equity Team. ""The initiatives that she has introduced and supported are making a measurable difference within the department and beyond. We are very proud to see her honored with this award.""Aside from her Legal department focus, Plimpton also serves as the executive sponsor for the Regions South Florida DEI Network and was recently involved with the first-ever Women of Regions Symposium, held during Women's History Month this year.""I am so excited that Tara is receiving this well-deserved recognition,"" said Clara Green, head of DEI at Regions. ""She demonstrates her commitment to this work through action. Tara also understands that to drive sustainable change in diversity, equity and inclusion, you must educate and partner with others.""As a result of her efforts to promote and implement DEI programs and culture for the Regions Legal department, earlier this year Plimpton was selected by the Birmingham Business Journal as a winner in their Leader in Diversity awards.The recognitions are great, but for Plimpton the urgency and need for change continue.""Like other industries, the legal profession has seen a great deal of progress in its diversity, equity and inclusion efforts during recent years,"" Plimpton said. ""But there is still much work to be done.""View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Regions Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Regions BankWebsite: profiles/regions-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Regions BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/723747/Regions-Tara-Plimpton-Recognized-for-DEI-Leadership]"

However, October data suggests that fewer home shoppers could afford to take advantage of the rise in available inventory, with time on market continuing to climb amid still-high listing prices.""As the rapid runup in rates reshapes housing market dynamics this fall, both buyers and sellers are taking a step back to recalibrate their plans. Home shoppers are looking at a monthly mortgage payment that is roughly $1,000 higher than at this time last year, and incomes are rising but not by that much. Combined with asking prices that are still climbing at a double-digit yearly pace, the average American has taken a huge hit to their homebuying power,"" said Danielle Hale, Chief Economist for Realtor.com®. ""Still, our data indicates that some aspiring homeowners are finding ways to make the most of inventory conditions, such as by exploring relatively affordable metros. For buyers with the flexibility, relocating to a lower-priced market could help offset higher mortgage costs. There's also a takeaway for sellers in these areas – on a well-priced home, you could still see strong interest from these out-of-towners.""October 2022 Housing Metrics – NationalMetricChange over Oct. 2021Change over Oct. 2020Change over Oct. 2019 Median listing price13.3% (to $425,000)21.8 %37.1 %Active listings33.5 %2.8 %-37.6 %New listings-15.9 %-23.1 %-16.3 %Median days on market6 days (to 51 days)5 days-18 days Share of active listingswith price reductions10.3 percentage points(to 20.9%)10.7 percentage points(from 10.2% in 2020)3.9 percentage points(from 17.0% in 2019)Inventory recovery accelerates amid higher rates and moderating demandIn October, the U.S. supply of active listings grew at a record-fast1 annual pace and surpassed 2020 levels for the first time, even as new sellers declined year-over-year for the fifth consecutive month. Additionally, pending listings, or homes under contract with a buyer, continued to drop. These trends indicate that October's accelerated inventory improvements were largely due to moderating buyer demand, fueled by mortgage costs that are rising at a faster pace than inflation and incomes. While some softening in seller participation is typical in the fall, this year's significant new listings declines reflect the impact of home shoppers' diminished buying power on seller sentiment. However, sellers may still see strong buyer competition for fewer options in some regions, with inventory still lagging October 2020 levels in the Northeast and Midwest, regions where home sales declines have also been more modest.Story continuesNationally, active inventory grew 33.5% year-over-year in October, reaching the highest level in 24 months. Meanwhile, both newly-listed homes (-15.9%) and pending listings (-30.0%) declined year-over-year.Among the 50 largest U.S. metros, 42 markets posted yearly active inventory gains in October, led by Phoenix (+173.9%), Raleigh, N.C. (+167.4%) and Nashville, Tenn. (+145.0%). The number of for-sale homes was still down year-over-year in the remaining eight markets, by the largest amounts in Hartford, Conn. (-25.7%), Virginia Beach, Va. (-11.0%) Milwaukee (-9.6%) and Chicago (-9.6%).On average across the 50 largest metros, no regions saw year-over-year new listing increases in October, with the greatest declines registered in the West (-20.6%), followed by the Northeast (-17.4%), Midwest (-15.0%) and South (-9.8%). Furthermore, newly-listed homes increased in just four markets: Nashville, Tenn. (+10.5%), New Orleans (+6.2%), Dallas (+5.6%) and San Antonio (+1.4%).Compared to October 2020, active inventory was higher in 32 of the 50 biggest markets, led by western (+33.9%) and southern metros (+7.2%): Phoenix (+132.0%), Austin, Texas (+120.8%), Riverside, Calif. (+67.2%), Memphis, Tenn. (+59.7%) and Nashville (+55.7%). Inventory remained lower than two years ago in the Northeast (-21.1%) and Midwest (-7.9%).Competition stalls as home listing prices and time on market hold steadyWith home sales activity declining along with affordability in October, national trends reflected a market in which competition continued at a cooler pace than during this year's summer peak. However, compared to last month, there was little change in both listing prices and time on market. This may be partly attributed to regional variations in supply and demand dynamics, with still-strong home shopper interest in relatively affordable markets balancing out the slowdown in other areas. In the Midwest and Northeast, where buyers saw relatively smaller inventory improvements in October, time on market and the share of homes with price reductions posted smaller year-over-year increases than in other regions.In October, national listing price trends were relatively unchanged from the prior month, with the median listing price dipping just $2,000 to $425,000. Additionally, annual home listing price growth decelerated just slightly, to 13.3% from 13.9% in September.On average across the 50 largest U.S. metros, yearly listing price growth entered single-digit territory in October (+9.2%). However, for-sale home prices continued to rise by double-digits year-over-year in 20 markets, led by Milwaukee (+34.5%), Miami (+25.1%) and Kansas City (+21.4%).The share of homes with price reductions was up 10.3 percentage points to 20.9% in October, well above 2017 (18.1%) and 2019 (17.0%) levels, but just under the 2018 share (21.2%). Western (+18.9 percentage points) and southern metros (+13.6 percentage points) posted the greatest increases in the share of price reductions: Phoenix (+35.9 percentage points), Austin (+31.2 percentage points) and Las Vegas (+24.4 percentage points).The typical home spent 51 days on the market in October, six days more than last year, but still 20 days faster than the typical 2017-2019 pace. The metros where homes spent longest on the market compared to October 2021 were Raleigh (+27 days), Austin (+26 days), Phoenix (+21 days) and Las Vegas (+21 days).Time on market declined year-over-year in October in 10 of the 50 largest metros, led by New Orleans (-21 days), where last year's pace was impacted by Hurricane Ida, followed by Richmond, Va. (-15 days) and Birmingham, Ala. (-6 days).Spotlight On: Higher housing costs fuel demand from out-of-town home shoppersSimilar to October's for-sale housing trends, the Realtor.com® Q3 Cross-Market Demand Report also released today highlights regional variations in homebuying activity. With rising rates pushing the typical monthly mortgage payment up 77.1% in October compared to a year ago, some buyers are potentially trying to add room in their budgets by searching further from where they live for lower-priced homes.Nationwide in Q3 2022, 60.7% of listings views on Realtor.com® came from users located outside of the listing's metro, compared to 56.9% during the prior quarter and 52.1% at the same time last year. Regionally, northeastern (69.0%) and western (65.7%) home shoppers were most likely to search out-of-market in Q3.

335,fda8f5cc-1de6-302d-aeeb-3c0c96ba765b,NWSA,2022-11-03,An Intrinsic Calculation For News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) Suggests It's 48% Undervalued,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intrinsic-calculation-news-corporation-nasdaq-165429909.html,1667408069,STORY,['NWSA'],"[Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of News Corporation (NASDAQ:NWSA) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to today's value. The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model is the tool we will apply to do this. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you. Check out our latest analysis for News The ModelWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$833.2mUS$900.1mUS$943.9mUS$1.11bUS$1.09bUS$1.08bUS$1.08bUS$1.09bUS$1.10bUS$1.11bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x7Analyst x4Analyst x3Analyst x2Est @ -0.79%Est @ 0.04%Est @ 0.62%Est @ 1.03%Est @ 1.31% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.9% US$779US$788US$773US$851US$779US$723US$677US$637US$602US$571(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.2bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.9%– 2.0%) = US$23bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$23b÷ ( 1 + 6.9%)10= US$12bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$19b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$17.0, the company appears quite undervalued at a 48% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at News as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.959. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation ideally won't be the sole piece of analysis you scrutinize for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

That's not Cali for California. It's Cali, Colombia, her hometown, and she made it to Mars. The Colombia native was NASA's flight director for the Mars 2020 mission.Trujillo is just one name among many Hispanics making strides in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). Yet today, Hispanic high school students in STEM courses are less likely to have internet access at home or feel school is preparing them for digital citizenship.So, what's at stake?For one thing, the country's pool of STEM talent. Hispanics make up the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. population, notes Raul Porras, Co-Founder and Board President of Latino STEM Alliance, but they are underrepresented in the tech workforce. ""If you take that trend to the extreme, that could reduce this country's ability to maintain its leadership in those fields.""How do we ensure that young Latinos and Hispanics have digital access and adequate representation in science and technology?Jennifer Marin is a communication strategist for Verizon and host for Entérate con Verizon, a news video series covering all things Verizon from a Hispanic/Latinx lens. She moved to the states when she was 6 years old from Armenia, Colombia, and after finishing her bachelors degree became a news reporter and anchor in the states. She encourages families to help their kids look online for local programs, clubs and schools that expose kids to math and sciences.""Then you go to your school Guidance Counselor. Ask questions. How do I become this type of profession? Is there a school you can recommend or club I can join to learn more? "" she says. ""We forge this path for ourselves.""Programs such as Verizon Innovative Learning, the company's award winning education initiative focused on addressing the barriers to digital inclusion for over a decade. The program is now scaling its education resources to reach over 3 million teachers nationwide with Verizon Innovative Learning HQ: A free education portal that makes next-gen learning tools such as AR, VR, and more available to all K-12 educatorsStory continuesTo honor of Hispanic Heritage Month this year-September 15 to October 15, 2022-we asked four leaders of the many nonprofit organizations working to increase the number of Latinos and Hispanics in the STEM workforce and got their advice on how to nurture a new generation of tech leaders.Latino STEM Alliance (LSA), Boston, MassachusettsKaren Chacón, Executive DirectorLSA provides STEM programs, specifically coding and robotics, to prekindergarten through high school students in both schools and community organizations in the Greater Boston area and the Merrimack Valley. The nonprofit has engaged more than 4,000 young people in its project-based learning programs, including nearly 1,000 students during the pandemic.Karen Chacón: In many cases, students and their parents are unaware of STEM career possibilities. STEM jobs are plentiful and will continue to grow. Without exposure and opportunity, our students will be shut out from these possibilities. As more youth see STEM professionals that look like them, the more interested they will be about STEM. So the first step is to introduce STEM to youth and their families. Representation matters!The easiest way is to expose students and their families to STEM technology, which not everyone has access to. For decades now, many people in the U.S. have had little to no access to the internet, including internet-based technology and devices. This has affected all levels of education for students, employment opportunities and much more.In the four years I have led Latino STEM Alliance, the percentage of Latinos in STEM fields has increased by only 1%. Given how fast the Latinx population is growing, and how much technology is expanding, the percentage of Latinos in STEM fields has tremendous potential to grow significantly in the coming years.We provide the equipment, teacher training and technical support services, as well as an engaging and relevant year-long coding and robotics skill-building curriculum. Students gain important college and career readiness skills and benefit from program opportunities such as building and coding VEX IQ robots, experimenting with CAD design software and 3D printing technology.Each year the curriculum theme changes and is a deep exploration of a STEM industry. At the end of the program, students participate in LSA's Robotics Competition and Family Science Fair, a free community event, to both celebrate and demonstrate their hard work and new coding skills.Ways to get involved:Be an LSA Ambassador by following the nonprofit on social media and attending their events.Visit the LSA website and volunteer your time and talent by mentoring students, hosting online workshops or serving on the Board of Directors.Make a gift to Latino STEM Alliance. Financial support from corporations, foundations and individuals enables LSA to expand access to STEM learning.Latinitas, Austin, TexasLiliana Cortez, Chief Programs OfficerCelebrating its 20th year, Latinitas is a nonprofit organization whose core mission is to empower all girls-ages 8 to 18-and increase the representation of Latina women in technology and media. Latinitas has served over 40,000 girls through their bilingual STEM after-school clubs, coding certificate programs, camps for web design and entrepreneurship, and technology and media conferences.Liliana Cortez: There's a lot of work to be done. We're not nearly where we want to be in terms of representation of women, especially Latina women, in those sectors of technology and science. But I've seen the progress. When we reach out to large tech companies and ask for speakers to come talk to the girls, we've done a lot of work to make sure that the speaker is someone our girls can relate to.We want them to be a person of color; we want a woman; and we want her to be sitting at the important tables where decisions are being made. And I want for the girls to relate to them, to see themselves in those places. ""She speaks Spanish like I do, her mom is Mexican like mine is, and look at where she is at. So, I can do that, too.""The work we're doing is critical for two reasons. First, we want to be lifting these communities out of poverty by providing Latinas with opportunities where they can improve their lifestyle. And second, we want to put Latina women at the table where decisions are being made. They can speak to specific situations such as the lack of access to the internet and technology that others may not have seen or experienced. We need people who come from diverse backgrounds, who have had diverse experiences, and who are seeing the diverse needs around our country.We have girls who have been coming to Latinitas summer camps, conferences and clubs since they were eight years old, and then they go off to high school. Once they're in college, we have an internship program and we connect them with a network that is going to help them look for a job.During the pandemic, we started reaching girls in other states and countries. Through our eight-week coding program, Code Chica, we graduated over 183 girls from Massachusetts, California, New York, Colorado, Costa Rica, Canada, Africa, India, the Philippines, the UK and Venezuela.Ways to get involved:Sign up to stay informed with volunteer opportunities; Latinitas has both in person and virtual options.Join Latinitas Empowerment Circle, a tiered giving program that rewards donors as they give more to the organization over their lifetime.Ask your employer to match your donation to Latinitas.TechLatino: Latinos in Information Sciences and Technology Association (LISTA), Atlanta, GeorgiaJose A. Marquez-Leon, CEO and PresidentTechLatino began as a networking group for Latino tech professionals and advocates for technology issues such as STEM education and broadband. Today, with the mission of empowering the Latino community with the use of technology, TechLatino has 15 chapters nationwide and a national STEM Honor Society supporting students in elementary through high school.Jose A. Marquez-Leon: In 1997 when we started, no one was talking about the future of the Hispanic community and technology. We went to Washington, D.C., and started talking with senators and congressmen, and few really understood the digital divide.Regarding getting more Latinos in the pipeline, our biggest concern right now is that there's not enough people talking about this as a problem.Companies must hire more Latinos, more African Americans. Everybody needs to be involved, so it's up to the corporations to make things happen.As early as possible, parents should be making sure they're educating their kids in mathematics and science. This is the future. Most of our jobs in the future will not be laborers. Parents need to educate themselves. Even though they may know their way around a computer, they need to know more than just being a consumer. They need an entrepreneurial spirit when it comes to raising their kids. Invest in kids and give them the tools they need to become winners in the tech industry.One thing I say to kids every day is, ""Being a nerd is cool."" Start to understand that your phone is about more than making TikTok videos. That's fun too. But what makes TikTok work? What is Twitter programming? How do I write code? Those things are extremely important for that next generation to become producers and not just consumers. Technology is the American dream!Ways to get involved:Join an organization like TechLatino and network with your peers. Each of us brings experience to share with our community.If you are a Latino or Hispanic in the technology industry, seek out a high school or junior high school and speak to students about STEM careers.Be a mentor. As you climb the ladder of success, reach back and bring someone with you.The commitment to invest in Hispanic and Latino talent must be made by everyone-parents, schools, universities, and tech and scientific companies. Working together, we will be able to effect change and create a STEM workforce that truly reflects the diversity of the country.More nonprofits parents and children can explore:Code.orgSociety of Mexican American Engineers and ScientistsSociety of Hispanic Professional EngineersLatina Girls CodeSociety for Advancement of Chicanos/Hispanics and Native Americans in ScienceStay up to speed on all things Hispanic from Verizon with Entérate con Verizon, Verizon's content platform celebrating diversity and the Latino community.About the author(s):Yolanda Parks is Executive Director, Content Standards and Client Strategy at Magid.

340,37f29be2-3435-38a8-af13-0df1e534d222,TPR,2022-11-03,Tapestry's Fifth Anniversary: 5 Forces That Shaped Our Company,ACCESSWIRE,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tapestrys-fifth-anniversary-5-forces-193000146.html,1667417400,STORY,['TPR'],"[NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / November 2, 2022 / Tapestry, Inc.Tapestry, Inc., Wednesday, November 2, 2022, Press release pictureFive years ago, on October 31st, 2017, leaders from Coach, kate spade new york, Stuart Weitzman and our corporate teams gathered at the NYSE to officially announce the creation of Tapestry Inc. It was a pivotal moment, one that signaled all the possibility that lay ahead for Tapestry and our brands, now united under one name and ticker. Together, we embarked on a mission to stretch what's possible for our brands and to move at the speed of the consumer.Yesterday, Tapestry returned to the NYSE floor to ring the closing bell in celebration of our 5 Year Anniversary. The world looks different than it did in 2017 -- a global pandemic changed the way we live and work and, importantly for Tapestry, accelerated critical trends in consumer behaviors.Here are five forces that shaped the last five years and set us on a path to long term success:1. Nurturing a Culture of BelongingAs I always say: Our people are our greatest competitive advantage. Over the last few years, we have redefined our company values and doubled down on our efforts to build a culture of belonging. We know that difference sparks brilliance - and our leaders and colleagues create an environment where our people feel empowered, fueling innovation and creativity.There's always room to grow, but I'm truly proud of some of the important achievements we've made in advancing our culture over the last 5 years including:We launched 5 employee resource groups, including our newest Latinx &amp; Hispanic Alliance, with the shared mission of bringing people together to connect on relevant topics, develop professional skills, and support one another.We're holding ourselves accountable and tying 10% of our VP+ leaders' annual incentive compensation to performance on our equity, diversity &amp; inclusion (EI&amp;D) scorecards.2. Committing to a Better-Made FutureIn 2019, we established Our Social Fabric 2025 goals to help drive positive change for Our People, Our Planet and Our Communities. And we've already made important strides toward completing our goals, including:Story continuesAdvancing access and equity initiatives and combating climate change by launching the Tapestry Foundation in 2021.Supporting the BIPOC fashion community by partnering with the FIT Social Justice Center - a unique higher education initiative that provides scholarships as well as mentorship, education, and career support for the BIPOC fashion community.Driving sustainability for the larger fashion industry and improving traceability within the leather value chain in Brazil by teaming up with the World Wildlife Foundation through the Tapestry Foundation in 2022.3. Facing the Unthinkable - The PandemicAs a retail company, our business and our people have faced innumerable, seemingly insurmountable challenges - including shutting down our stores, the halt of tourism, remote work and supply chain disruptions. For far too many, the pandemic brought with it incredible losses, and health struggles (including mental health).The resilience and agility that our people demonstrated - and continue to demonstrate, particularly in China where there are still disruptions - is inspiring. Our corporate team temporarily shifted into a fully remote work model and our store employees came up with creative, digital ways to engage with consumers - even during lockdowns. We faced the challenges and tough decisions head-on, adapted quickly to change, and I believe we came out stronger.4. Evolving our Supply ChainWhile the pandemic threw the world into a supply chain crisis, we continued to think about how to drive long-term agility across our supply chain. After all, the strength of our supply chain affects how quickly we can deliver our products to customers - whether we're manufacturing products to be sold in store or shipping a product to a customer's doorstep.We worked with partners around the world to shift production and keep pace with demand fluctuations regionally. Many of these changes and new ways of working are now embedded in our business. And, in 2021 we broke ground on a state-of-the-art 788k sq. foot facility in Las Vegas, Nevada, which will be completed next year. This new center is being built with sustainability in mind and leverages the latest advances in technology to create an even better shopping experience for our customers.5. Transforming through our Acceleration ProgramWhen we launched our ""Acceleration Program"" in early 2020, we had three primary objectives: get closer to our consumers, lean into digital, data and analytics, and evolve our ways of working to become leaner and responsive to change.Over the last 2.5 years, our teams have done the incredibly hard work required to bring our vision of a transformed Tapestry to life - and the proof is in our results.

A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In the third quarter, the fund declined 2.38% (Institutional Shares) compared to a 3.37% decline for the Russell 3000 Growth Index and a 4.88% decline for the S&amp;P 500 Index.  The fund fell sharply for the year-to-date and trailing 12-month periods; however, the philosophy of the fund is to achieve strong long-term performance. In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2022.Baron Funds discussed stocks like NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in the Q3 2022 investor letter. Headquartered in Santa Clara, California, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a global graphics, and compute and networking solutions provider. On October 31, 2022, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock closed at $134.97 per share. One-month return of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was 2.51% and its shares lost 48.88% of their value over the last 52 weeks. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has a market capitalization of $336.345 billion.Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:""NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below.During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. View our latest analysis for NVIDIA The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At NVIDIAThe Independent Director, Mark Stevens, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$51m worth of shares at a price of US$186 each. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. The silver lining is that this sell-down took place above the latest price (US$135). So it is hard to draw any strong conclusion from it.In the last year NVIDIA insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeIf you like to buy stocks that insiders are buying, rather than selling, then you might just love this free list of companies. (Hint: insiders have been buying them).NVIDIA Insiders Are Selling The StockThe last three months saw significant insider selling at NVIDIA. In total, Independent Director Mark Stevens dumped US$20m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. In light of this it's hard to argue that all the insiders think that the shares are a bargain.Insider Ownership Of NVIDIAFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. NVIDIA insiders own about US$13b worth of shares (which is 4.0% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The NVIDIA Insider Transactions Indicate?An insider sold NVIDIA shares recently, but they didn't buy any. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, NVIDIA makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for NVIDIA you should know about.But note: NVIDIA may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Harvard University Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Picks. Harvard Management Company was established in 1974 and manages Harvard University's endowment and financial assets. Over the years, the market-beating performance of Harvard Management Company has contributed billions of dollars to Harvard University. The value of Harvard University’s endowment declined by $2.3 billion in 2022, after Harvard Management Company posted a 1.8% loss on its investments. This marks the first year of negative returns since 2016. This is a distinct contrast to the record-high 33.6% returns that Harvard Management Company reported last year.Harvard Management Company’s loss is primarily attributed to skyrocketing inflation and high interest rates, which have created havoc in the global financial markets. The endowment underperformed due to “the poor performance of global equity markets”, noted HMC CEO N.P. Narvekar. Overall, the performance of the Harvard University stock portfolio was satisfying relative to the global equity markets. The portfolio was previously managed by Jane Mendillo, and she served as the president and chief executive officer of the endowment before departing from her position in 2014, after 21 years with HMC. She is an American investor, endowment fund manager, and philanthropist. The endowment contributed $2.1 billion towards the university’s operational budget for the fiscal year 2022, accounting for 36% of the annual revenue. Harvard concluded the fiscal year with a budget surplus of $406 million. Harvard Management Company has delivered upbeat returns historically, which makes it a good idea to follow its investment strategy. Some of the best stocks in the Harvard University stock portfolio include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM). Story continuesbenjamin-rascoe-RxIIEFEvybo-unsplash Our Methodology We used Harvard Management Company’s stock portfolio for the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis.

Typically, we'll see the trend of both return on capital employed (ROCE) declining and this usually coincides with a decreasing amount of capital employed. Trends like this ultimately mean the business is reducing its investments and also earning less on what it has invested. So after we looked into McKesson Europe (HMSE:CLS1), the trends above didn't look too great.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?If you haven't worked with ROCE before, it measures the 'return' (pre-tax profit) a company generates from capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on McKesson Europe is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.024 = €69m ÷ (€5.1b - €2.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2022).Therefore, McKesson Europe has an ROCE of 2.4%. Ultimately, that's a low return and it under-performs the Healthcare industry average of 5.7%. View our latest analysis for McKesson Europe roceWhile the past is not representative of the future, it can be helpful to know how a company has performed historically, which is why we have this chart above. If you're interested in investigating McKesson Europe's past further, check out this free graph of past earnings, revenue and cash flow.How Are Returns Trending?There is reason to be cautious about McKesson Europe, given the returns are trending downwards. Unfortunately the returns on capital have diminished from the 9.1% that they were earning five years ago. Meanwhile, capital employed in the business has stayed roughly the flat over the period. Since returns are falling and the business has the same amount of assets employed, this can suggest it's a mature business that hasn't had much growth in the last five years. If these trends continue, we wouldn't expect McKesson Europe to turn into a multi-bagger.On a side note, McKesson Europe has done well to pay down its current liabilities to 45% of total assets. So we could link some of this to the decrease in ROCE. What's more, this can reduce some aspects of risk to the business because now the company's suppliers or short-term creditors are funding less of its operations. Since the business is basically funding more of its operations with it's own money, you could argue this has made the business less efficient at generating ROCE. Keep in mind 45% is still pretty high, so those risks are still somewhat prevalent.Story continuesOur Take On McKesson Europe's ROCEIn summary, it's unfortunate that McKesson Europe is generating lower returns from the same amount of capital. It should come as no surprise then that the stock has fallen 11% over the last five years, so it looks like investors are recognizing these changes. Unless there is a shift to a more positive trajectory in these metrics, we would look elsewhere.One more thing, we've spotted   1 warning sign  facing McKesson Europe that you might find interesting.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

The bottom line declined 1.5% on a year-over-year basis.GAAP earnings per share in the quarter were $6.46, up 277.8% from the year-ago quarter.Revenue DetailsRevenues of $70.16 billion surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.7%. The top line increased 5.4% year over year, reflecting strong growth in the United States, partially offset by lower international sales as the company continued to divest its European businesses.Q2 Segmental AnalysisFollowing McKesson’s segment realignment effective in the quarter under review, the reporting segments are as follows:Revenues at the U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment were $60.1 billion, up 12% year over year. Per management, the upside was primarily driven by market growth and a higher volume of specialty products, including an increase in volumes from retail national account customers. However, branded-to-generic conversions partially offset the upside.The U.S. Pharmaceutical and Specialty Solutions segment reported an adjusted operating profit of $756 million, up 3% from the prior-year quarter. This was due to growth in the distribution of specialty products to providers and health systems, partially mitigated by lower demand for COVID-19 vaccine distribution. The adjusted metric for the segment was up 5%, excluding the impact of COVID-19 vaccine distribution.At the International segment, revenues amounted to $6.2 billion, down 32% year over year, courtesy divestitures of McKesson’s UK and Austrian businesses.McKesson Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcKesson Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMcKesson Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | McKesson Corporation QuoteAdjusted operating profit at the segment was $151 million, down 7% from the year-ago quarter.Revenues at the Medical-Surgical Solutions segment totaled $2.8 billion, down 9% year over year due to lower sales of COVID-19 tests, partially offset by growth in the primary care business.Story continuesThe Medical-Surgical segment delivered an adjusted operating profit of $307 million, which declined 4% from the year-ago quarter. Excluding the impact of COVID-related items, the adjusted metric was up 7%.Revenues at the Prescription Technology Solutions segment totaled $1 billion, up 9% year over year. The improvement can be attributed to an increase in prescription from third-party logistics as well as higher technology services revenues.Adjusted operating profit was $141 million at the Prescription Technology Solutions segment, down 2% from the prior-year quarter.MarginsGross profit in the reported quarter was $3.1 billion, down 7.7% on a year-over-year basis. Meanwhile, gross profit accounted for 4.4% of net revenues.The company reported an operating income of $1.1 billion, up 108.5% from the year-ago quarter. Operating margin accounted for 1.6% of net revenues.Financial UpdateIn the quarter under review, cash and cash equivalents were $2.92 billion, compared with $2.23 billion in the previous quarter.Cumulative net cash provided in operating activities in the fiscal second quarter amounted to $166 million, down from $170 million in the year-ago period.Fiscal 2023 Guidance RaisedFor fiscal 2023, the company now projects adjusted EPS to be $24.45-$24.95, up from the previously guided range of $23.95-$24.65. The company raised the guidance following solid fiscal second-quarter results and increased contributions from the U.S. government’s COVID-19 response efforts. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $24.41.The earnings outlook includes 60 cents to 70 cents associated with the U.S. government’s COVID-19 vaccine distribution and another $1.00 to $1.10 associated with the U.S. government’s kitting, storage and distribution of ancillary supplies program and COVID-19 tests. It also includes a negative impact of 15 cents related to year-to-date net gains and losses associated with McKesson Ventures' equity investments.Summing UpMcKesson exited the fiscal second quarter on a mixed note, beating estimates for revenues but missing the same for earnings. However, the strong fiscal second quarter show across all its four segments is encouraging. A strong earnings outlook for fiscal 2023 instills optimism.However, price fluctuation of generic pharmaceuticals and stiff competition in the MedTech space are other headwinds.Zacks Rank and Other Key PicksCurrently, McKesson carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Some other top-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Elevance Health, Inc.

(NYSE: TRV), the country’s largest workers compensation insurer, today announced the launch of Wysa for Return to Work – an app designed to promote the mental health of injured employees and facilitate a more holistic recovery. The app was created in partnership with Wysa, a provider of mental health support solutions driven by artificial intelligence.""Factors unrelated to an individual’s injury, such as fear, unrealistic expectations, lack of sleep or minimal social support, can hinder the recovery process,"" said Dr. Marcos Iglesias, Chief Medical Director at Travelers. ""Helping injured employees bounce back requires an approach that addresses an individual’s physical and mental health challenges, and we’re pleased to offer another tool that supports the total well-being of our customers’ employees.""According to Travelers workers compensation claim data, more than 40% of employees who have missed workdays due to injury have experienced a psychosocial barrier to recovery. The Wysa for Return to Work app helps users build mental resilience skills that can assist in overcoming those barriers. The app responds to what users communicate through a secure, anonymous, texting-style platform, and offers strategies that include cognitive behavioral techniques, guided meditation and breathing exercises.The new app is accessible to injured employees who indicate one or more psychosocial barriers to their recovery during conversations with a Travelers nurse or claim professional. Early pilot results show that injured employees using Wysa for Return to Work have reduced the number of missed workdays by approximately one-third, compared to those not using the app.Travelers utilizes a range of workers compensation services to help expedite recovery, including:The Virtual Visit tool, which enables nurses and claim professionals to conduct real-time video chats with employers, medical providers and injured employees to discuss matters pertaining to the recovery process;MyTravelers® for Injured Employees, a secure, web-based tool that helps individuals navigate the workers compensation claim process;The Early Severity Predictor® model, which helps identify which injured employees are most at risk for chronic pain; andThe ConciergeCLAIM® Nurse program, which also helps injured employees with the workers compensation process through a one-on-one connection with a nurse.Story continuesFor more information on workers compensation products and services from Travelers, visit Travelers.com.About TravelersThe Travelers Companies, Inc.

Pricing improved in the three largest regional segments.Commenting on the results, Air Products' Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer Seifi Ghasemi said, ""Working together, the Air Products team delivered higher volume and pricing in our base industrial gas business while investing in and executing world-class projects to drive the energy transition forward. Despite significant macroeconomic challenges, our people stayed focused and agile, serving our customers and demonstrating a bold commitment to make a cleaner, better future a reality. These results demonstrate the ability of Air Products to deliver strong near-term results while pursuing our longer-term growth strategy. ""Fiscal Fourth Quarter Results by Business SegmentAmericas sales of $1,542 million were up 38 percent over the prior year on 19 percent higher energy cost pass-through, 12 percent higher volumes, and eight percent higher pricing, partially offset by one percent unfavorable currency. Operating income of $333 million increased 15 percent and adjusted EBITDA of $515 million increased eight percent, in each case due to the higher pricing and higher volumes, partially offset by higher costs. Adjusted EBITDA also reflects lower equity affiliates' income. Operating margin of 21.6 percent decreased 440 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.4 percent decreased 930 basis points, each of which included a negative impact from energy cost pass-through of about 400 basis points and about 650 basis points, respectively.Asia sales of $860 million increased 14 percent over the prior year on 16 percent higher volumes, three percent higher pricing, and two percent higher energy cost pass-through, partially offset by seven percent unfavorable currency. Operating income of $263 million increased 28 percent and adjusted EBITDA of $373 million increased 13 percent, in each case due to the favorable volumes and pricing, which were partially offset by higher costs and unfavorable currency. Operating margin of 30.6 percent increased 330 basis points while adjusted EBITDA margin of 43.3 percent decreased 50 basis points.Europe sales of $864 million increased 34 percent over the prior year on 30 percent higher energy cost pass-through and 19 percent higher pricing across all product lines and sub-regions, partially offset by 15 percent unfavorable currency. Volumes were stable despite the challenging economic environment. Operating income of $150 million increased 20 percent and adjusted EBITDA of $217 million increased eight percent, in each case primarily driven by higher pricing, which was partially offset by unfavorable currency and higher costs. Operating margin of 17.4 percent decreased 200 basis points and adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.1 percent decreased 600 basis points, each of which included a negative impact from energy cost pass-through of about 450 basis points and about 750 basis points, respectively.Middle East and India equity affiliates' income of $63 million was up $41 million over the prior year, primarily from the Jazan joint venture.Corporate and other sales of $263 million decreased 12 percent compared to the prior year, driven by lower sale of equipment activity.OutlookEffective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year 2023, management will review adjusted earnings per share excluding the impact of non-service related components of the net periodic benefit/cost for our defined benefit pension plans. Air Products expects full-year fiscal 2023 adjusted EPS guidance of $11.20 to $11.50, up nine to 12 percent over prior year adjusted EPS. For the fiscal 2023 first quarter, Air Products' adjusted EPS guidance is $2.60 to $2.80, up five to 13 percent over fiscal 2022 first quarter adjusted EPS. The projected percentage increase in adjusted EPS for full year fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2023 first quarter is calculated using adjusted fiscal 2022 results in order to present this information on a consistent basis using the calculation of adjusted EPS that will be applied in fiscal year 2023. Refer to the reconciliations of GAAP to non-GAAP historical results below for additional information.Air Products expects capital expenditures of $5.0 - $5.5 billion for full-year fiscal 2023.Management has provided adjusted EPS guidance on a continuing operations basis, which excludes the impact of certain items that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance, such as the incurrence of additional costs for cost reduction actions and impairment charges, or the recognition of gains or losses on disclosed items. It is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to predict the timing or occurrence of these events or the potential for other transactions that may impact future GAAP EPS or the effective tax rate. Similarly, it is not possible, without unreasonable efforts, to reconcile our forecasted capital expenditures to future cash used for investing activities because we are unable to identify the timing or occurrence of our future investment activity, which is driven by our assessment of competing opportunities at the time we enter into transactions. Furthermore, it is not possible to identify the potential significance of these events in advance, but any of these events, if they were to occur, could have a significant effect on our future GAAP results. Management therefore is unable to reconcile, without unreasonable effort, the Company's forecasted range of adjusted EPS, the effective tax rate and our capital expenditures to a comparable GAAP range.Earnings TeleconferenceAccess the fiscal 2022 fourth quarter earnings teleconference scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time on November 3, 2022 by calling 323-794-2093 and entering passcode 7733307 or by accessing the Event Details page on Air Products' Investor Relations website.About Air ProductsAir Products (NYSE:APD) is a world-leading industrial gases company in operation for over 80 years focused on serving energy, environmental, and emerging markets.

On a consolidated basis, these measures include adjusted diluted earnings per share (""EPS""), adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted effective tax rate, and capital expenditures. On a segment basis, these measures include adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA margin. In addition to these measures, we also present certain supplemental non-GAAP financial measures to help the reader understand the impact that certain disclosed items, or ""non-GAAP adjustments,"" have on the calculation of our adjusted diluted EPS. For each non-GAAP financial measure, we present a reconciliation to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.In many cases, non-GAAP financial measures are determined by adjusting the most directly comparable GAAP measure to exclude non-GAAP adjustments that we believe are not representative of our underlying business performance. For example, we previously excluded certain expenses associated with cost reduction actions, impairment charges, and gains on disclosed transactions. The reader should be aware that we may recognize similar losses or gains in the future.When applicable, the tax impact of our pre-tax non-GAAP adjustments reflects the expected current and deferred income tax impact of our non-GAAP adjustments. These tax impacts are primarily driven by the statutory tax rate of the various relevant jurisdictions and the taxability of the adjustments in those jurisdictions.We provide these non-GAAP financial measures to allow investors, potential investors, securities analysts, and others to evaluate the performance of our business in the same manner as our management. We believe these measures, when viewed together with financial results computed in accordance with GAAP, provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our historical financial performance and projected future results. However, we caution readers not to consider these measures in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Readers should also consider the limitations associated with these non-GAAP financial measures, including the potential lack of comparability of these measures from one company to another.NON-GAAP ADJUSTMENTSOur non-GAAP adjustments for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended 30 September 2022 are detailed below. There were no non-GAAP adjustments in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021. For information related to non-GAAP adjustments for the fiscal year ended 30 September 2021, refer to Exhibit 99.1 to our Current Report on Form 8-K dated 4 November 2021.Business and Asset ActionsDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we divested our small industrial gas business in Russia due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. As a result, we recorded a noncash charge of $73.7 ($61.0 after tax, or $0.27 per share), which included transaction costs and cumulative currency translation losses. This charge is reflected as ""Business and asset actions"" on our consolidated income statements and was not recorded in the results of our Europe segment.Equity Method Investment Impairment ChargeDuring the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we determined there was an other-than-temporary impairment in two small equity affiliates in the Asia segment. As a result, we recorded a noncash charge of $14.8 ($11.1 after tax, or $0.05 per share) to write down the full carrying value of the investments. This charge is reflected on our consolidated income statements within ""Equity affiliates' income"" and was not recorded in segment results.Discontinued OperationsIn the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2022, we recognized income from discontinued operations, net of tax, of $12.6 ($0.06 per share). This primarily resulted from a net tax benefit recorded upon release of tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions associated with our former Performance Materials Division for which the statute of limitations expired.ADJUSTED DILUTED EPSThe table below provides a reconciliation to the most directly comparable GAAP measure for each of the major components used to calculate adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations, which we view as a key performance metric. In periods that we have non-GAAP adjustments, we believe it is important for the reader to understand the per share impact of each such adjustment because management does not consider these impacts when evaluating underlying business performance. Per share impacts are calculated independently and may not sum to total diluted EPS and total adjusted diluted EPS due to rounding.Three Months Ended 30 SeptemberQ4 2022 vs. Q4 2021OperatingIncomeEquity Affiliates' IncomeIncome Tax ProvisionNet IncomeAttributable to Air ProductsDilutedEPSQ4 2022 GAAP$626.5$96.8$130.6$570.5$2.56Q4 2021 GAAP616.791.8125.3558.62.51Change GAAP$0.05% Change GAAP2 %Q4 2022 GAAP$626.5$96.8$130.6$570.5$2.56Business and asset actions73.7—12.761.00.27Equity method investment impairment charge—14.83.711.10.05Q4 2022 Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$700.2$111.6$147.0$642.6$2.89Q4 2021 GAAP$616.7$91.8$125.3$558.6$2.51No non-GAAP adjustments—————Q4 2021 Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$616.7$91.8$125.3$558.6$2.51Change Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")$0.38% Change Non-GAAP (""Adjusted"")15 %Twelve Months Ended 30 September2022 vs. 2021OperatingIncome]"

Let’s examine Genuine Parts’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Genuine Parts What's The Opportunity In Genuine Parts?According to my valuation model, the stock is currently overvalued by about 24%, trading at US$179 compared to my intrinsic value of $144.53. This means that the buying opportunity has probably disappeared for now. Another thing to keep in mind is that Genuine Parts’s share price is quite stable relative to the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards its intrinsic value over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What kind of growth will Genuine Parts generate?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Genuine Parts' earnings growth are expected to be in the teens in the upcoming years, indicating a solid future ahead. This should lead to robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in GPC’s positive outlook, with shares trading above its fair value. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe GPC should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards its real value can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on GPC for a while, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its true value, which means there’s no upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for GPC, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

Multiple flight cancelations and booking weaknesses due to Hurricane Ian also hurt results. DAL reported earnings of 30 cents per share a year ago, dull in comparison to the current scenario, as air-travel demand was not so buoyant then.DAL reported revenues of $13,975 million, which lagged the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,157.2 million.

UAL’s revenues increased more than 66% year over year owing to an upbeat in air-travel demand.

These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -17.21%.

Robinson , which belongs to the Zacks Transportation - Services industry, posted revenues of $6.02 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.54%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $6.26 billion.

Robinson shares have lost about 9.1% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.1%.What's Next for C.H. Robinson?While C.H. Robinson has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for C.H. Robinson: mixed.

(NYSE: CMI) today reported results for the third quarter of 2022.Third quarter revenues in total were $7.3 billion. Excluding the contribution of the Meritor, Inc. business, the acquisition of which was completed on August 3, 2022, third quarter revenues were $6.6 billion, representing an increase of 11 percent from the same quarter in 2021. Sales in North America increased 19 percent and international revenues decreased 1 percent compared to the same quarter in 2021, as strong demand across all global markets was offset by a market slowdown in China, as well as Russia, where operations have been suspended indefinitely.""During the third quarter of 2022, Cummins advanced its growth strategy most notably with the completion of the acquisition of Meritor, and we have been excited to welcome our new colleagues into our company,"" said President and CEO Jennifer Rumsey. ""Demand from customers remains strong, reflecting the quality and performance of our products and robust conditions in most markets except China. EBITDA for the third quarter improved year-over-year but declined compared to the second quarter of 2022, reflecting weaker joint venture earnings in China, a one-time bonus to employees to recognize their relentless commitment to meeting customer demand in challenging conditions, and costs associated with both the Meritor acquisition and the planned separation of our Filtration business. We expect results for Meritor and Cummins in total to improve in the fourth quarter.""Story continuesNet income attributable to Cummins in the third quarter was $400 million, or $2.82 per diluted share. Excluding the Meritor business and related acquisition and integration costs, net income in the third quarter was $456 million, or $3.21 per diluted share, compared to $534 million, or $3.69 per diluted share, in 2021. The tax rate in the third quarter was 32.7 percent including $57 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, of unfavorable discrete items, primarily related to the planned separation of the Filtration business.Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the third quarter was $884 million, or 12.1 percent of sales. Excluding the Meritor business and related acquisition and integration costs, EBITDA was $907 million, or 13.8 percent of sales, compared to $862 million, or 14.4 percent of sales, a year ago. Third quarter results include costs of $16 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, related to the separation of the Filtration business. In addition, to recognize the extraordinary efforts by employees during the challenges over the last several years, as well as promote retention in a period of tight labor markets, a one-time employee recognition bonus was announced and recorded during the third quarter, which had a cost impact of $56 million.The third quarter results for the company included two months of operations following the acquisition of Meritor. Meritor results within the third quarter include $737 million in revenue, EBITDA of $2 million and GAAP1 net loss of $37 million. Results of Meritor include an inventory valuation adjustment as required by purchase accounting, which resulted in a negative impact of $32 million. Third quarter results also include $25 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, of acquisition related costs, which consist of consulting and banker fees, and employee separation and retention payments. EBITDA for Meritor operations, excluding the purchase accounting and acquisition and integration costs, was $54 million in the third quarter, or 7.3 percent of sales.Updated 2022 Outlook:Based on its current forecast, excluding the Meritor business, Cummins is providing the following update of its outlook for the full year 2022:Full year 2022 revenue guidance is being maintained, with revenue expected to be up 8 percent.Full year 2022 EBITDA is now expected to be approximately 15.0 percent of sales, excluding the Meritor business and related acquisition and integration costs, the impacts of the indefinite suspension of our operations in Russia and the costs associated with preparing for the expected separation of our Filtration business. This is below the company’s previous guidance of approximately 15.5 percent of sales and reflects an improvement from the third quarter to the fourth quarter.The company continues to expect to return approximately 50 percent of Operating Cash Flow to shareholders in 2022 in the form of dividends and share repurchases.Cummins expects revenues of the Meritor business from the August 3 completion of the acquisition through the end of 2022 will be between $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion. During the same period, EBITDA from the Meritor business is expected to be approximately 4.5 percent of sales based upon the U.S. GAAP results.Third Quarter 2022 Highlights:On August 3, Cummins completed the acquisition of Meritor, Inc., a leading global supplier of drivetrain, mobility, braking, aftermarket and electric powertrain solutions for commercial vehicle and industrial markets. The integration of Meritor’s people, products and capabilities in axle and brake technology will position Cummins as a leading provider of integrated powertrain solutions across internal combustion and electric power applications. The acquisition of Meritor is expected to generate annual pre-tax run-rate synergies of approximately $130 million by year three after closing, anticipated to be comprised of, among other things, SG&amp;A savings, supply chain operations and facilities optimization.The company announced several collaborations that further enable our customers to achieve their decarbonization goals. During the third quarter, Cummins announced collaborations with Werner Enterprises, Transport Enterprise Leasing (TEL) and Versatile to deliver 15-liter hydrogen internal combustion engines. The X15H hydrogen engine, part of Cummins’ fuel agnostic platform, will enable a more-timely solution to reduce carbon emissions by providing customers with an option that has powertrain installation commonality and end user familiarity.The New Power business continued to expand its green hydrogen presence globally. Cummins announced it will expand PEM electrolyzer manufacturing capacity at its Oevel, Belgium, factory to 1 gigawatt (GW). The company also announced it will begin producing electrolyzers in the United States, underscoring the company’s continued dedication to advancing the nation’s green hydrogen economy. Electrolyzer production will take place in Fridley, Minnesota, starting at 500 megawatts (MW) of manufacturing capacity annually, scalable to 1 gigawatt (GW) in the future. In addition to electrolyzer capacity expansion, the business successfully launched the Cummins HD120 fuel cell system in China by delivering 52 units to the Lin-gang Government for a bus application.Cummins published its 19th annual Sustainability Progress Report, including the company’s first update on progress on Cummins’ 2030 environmental goals aligned to its PLANET 2050 environmental strategy.Progress continues to be made on the planned separation of the Filtration business.The company increased its quarterly dividend from $1.45 to $1.57 per share. Cummins has paid higher annual dividends to shareholders for 13 consecutive years.1 Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S.Third quarter 2022 detail (all comparisons to same period in 2021):Engine SegmentSales - $2.8 billion, up 8 percentSegment EBITDA - $363 million, or 13.1 percent of sales, compared to $391 million or 15.2 percent of salesOn-highway revenues increased 10 percent driven by strong demand in the North American truck market, pricing actions and strong aftermarket demand.

Lower-than-expected auto-dimming mirror shipments in North American market and sales from the automotive segment resulted in the underperformance.The Zeeland-based automotive products supplier reported net sales of $493.6 million, falling short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $498 million but increasing 24% from the year-ago period. The company recorded a gross margin of 29.8%, lower than the year-ago quarter’s 35.3%, due to increases in raw material and labor costs owing to higher wages and labor inefficiencies, and unfavorable product mix.Gentex Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseGentex Corporation Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseGentex Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Gentex Corporation QuoteSegmental PerformanceThe Automotive segment’s net sales — which have the highest contribution to Gentex’s revenues — totaled $480.9 million in the third quarter, 23% higher than $391.3 million reported in the year-ago quarter. Despite this, the figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $484 million. In the reported quarter, auto-dimming mirror shipments in the North American market increased 16% to 3,758,000 units but lagged the consensus mark of 3,871,000 units. Shipments rose 18% year over year in the international markets to 7,731,000 units and topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 7,402,000 units. Total shipments increased 17% to 11,489,000 units, outpacing the consensus mark of 11,274,000 units.Other net sales, which include dimmable aircraft windows and fire protection products, increased 42% from the year-ago quarter’s $8.3 million to $12.7 million, crossing the consensus metric of $10.38 million. Fire protection sales increased 78%. Dimmable aircraft window sales fell 7% from the third quarter of 2021. Gentex continues to expect that the dimmable aircraft window sales will be hampered until a meaningful recovery of the aerospace industry begins and the Boeing 787 aircraft production levels get a boost.Story continuesFinancial TidbitsTotal operating expenses rose 15% year over year to $60.4 million in third-quarter 2022 mainly due to staffing, professional fees, increased outbound freight expenses and travel-related expenses. Engineering and R&amp;D expenses increased to $33.5 million from $29.7 million. SG&amp;A expenses jumped to almost $27 million from nearly $23 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2021.Gentex paid dividends of 12 cents per share in the quarter. During the quarter, it repurchased 0.9 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $26 per share for a total sum of $22.3 million. As of Sep 30, 2022, the company had nearly 21.5 million shares remaining for buyback per its previously announced share repurchase plan. Gentex had cash and cash equivalents of nearly $223 million as of Sep 30, 2022, down from $262.3 million as of Dec 31, 2021.GuidancePer IHS Markit, third-quarter 2022 light vehicle production (LVP) in North America, Europe, China, Japan and Korea is expected to increase 2.7% year over year to 18.26 million units. Full-year 2022 and 2023 LVP is expected to increase 5% and 4%, respectively, on a year-over-year basis.Gentex remains concerned about high levels of volatility in customer orders and vehicle production volumes.

370,7ab0ea97-effb-31f4-8ed2-5c7062de8885,DIS,2022-11-03,Is The Walt Disney Company's (NYSE:DIS) Stock Price Struggling As A Result Of Its Mixed Financials?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/walt-disney-companys-nyse-dis-120017437.html,1667476817,STORY,['DIS'],"[Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) has had a rough three months with its share price down 5.8%. We, however decided to study the company's financials to determine if they have got anything to do with the price decline. Long-term fundamentals are usually what drive market outcomes, so it's worth paying close attention. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Walt Disney's  ROE today.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. Check out our latest analysis for Walt Disney How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Walt Disney is:3.4% = US$3.6b ÷ US$106b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2022).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.03 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Walt Disney's Earnings Growth And 3.4% ROEIt is hard to argue that Walt Disney's ROE is much good in and of itself. Even compared to the average industry ROE of 8.5%, the company's ROE is quite dismal. Given the circumstances, the significant decline in net income by 39% seen by Walt Disney over the last five years is not surprising. We reckon that there could also be other factors at play here. Such as - low earnings retention or poor allocation of capital.Story continuesThat being said, we compared Walt Disney's performance with the industry and were concerned when we found that while the company has shrunk its earnings, the industry has grown its earnings at a rate of 25% in the same period.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for DIS? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report. Is Walt Disney Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?While the company did payout a portion of its dividend in the past, it currently doesn't pay a dividend. This implies that potentially all of its profits are being reinvested in the business.ConclusionIn total, we're a bit ambivalent about Walt Disney's performance. While the company does have a high rate of profit retention, its low rate of return is probably hampering its earnings growth. With that said, we studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that while the company has shrunk its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to grow in the future.

They include DC Comics, Disney, Marvel, Lego, Transformers and the Mickey Mouse, Minnie Mouse, Donald Duck, Spider-Man and Super Mario brands, but does not cover movies.The ministry also added around 35 brands of alcohol to the list. These include Jack Daniel's, made by Brown-Forman Corp, Pernod Ricard SA's Malibu as well as the Bell's and Johnnie Walker whiskies, which are both owned by Diageo PLC.More than 1.6 million tons of goods worth a combined $12.6 billion have been imported into Russia since the scheme was launched in May, the head of the federal customs service told TASS news agency in October.Moscow says the scheme is not about allowing counterfeit goods into the country, but letting retailers import legitimate products through third countries like China, Kazakhstan and Turkey, instead of directly from the manufacturer.Walt Disney suspended operations in Russia, including the release of new Marvel films, in March as it condemned Russia's ""unprovoked invasion"" and ""unrelenting assault on Ukraine.""(Reporting by Jake Cordell, editing by David Ljunggren and Sandra Maler)]"

""Any commentary that implies it has to do with succession planning is absurd and comes from sources with no knowledge of the strategy.""There are other factors motivating the merger including a bid to achieve greater scale in news, live sports and information, sources said. Lachlan Murdoch did not discuss the potential deal on Tuesday's earnings call, but talked up the value of scale, ""particularly (in) the next couple of years, when opportunities in the marketplace will emerge.""As recently as August, Lachlan Murdoch described sports betting as ""a huge opportunity"" for Fox Sports, telling Wall Street it would fuel viewer engagement. Combining live game broadcasts with News Corp's sports coverage would create a more compelling sports package, and strengthen the company's hand when it comes to sports betting, according to people familiar with the deal's logic.But Wall Street's enthusiasm for sports betting has cooled since early 2021, as investors prioritize profitability over spending aggressively to acquire new customers. Thirty-six U.S. states and the District of Columbia have legalized sports betting, though the pace has slowed.""The thing about the sports betting opportunity is it started off like a house on fire, with all the states approving it,"" said Huber Research Inc analyst Douglas Arthur. ""But I'm not hearing as much excitement about it right now as I did nine months ago. If that's the rationale (for the merger), it's a pretty weak one.”Story continuesSince the start of 2022, the stock prices of 11 major publicly traded sports betting companies, including DraftKings Inc and Barstool Sportsbook's Penn Entertainment Inc , have tumbled by an average of 35%, according to Refinitiv data.That does not necessarily mean the pace of legalized sports betting is slowing. Total wagers are expected to reach $390 billion globally this year, according to researcher H2 Gambling Capital. Kantar Sports analyst Ryan McConnell said the market is flooded with new entrants and consolidation appears likely.Casualties are starting to build up. Streaming service FuboTV shuttered its sports betting service in October, and Churchill Downs announced in February that it would abandon online sports.""It's a highly competitive market,"" said gaming industry analyst Steve Ruddock. ""It's difficult for companies that aren't fully invested in that as their primary business to compete.""SLOW STARTSince selling their movie assets to the Walt Disney Co in 2019, the Murdochs laid a new course for a slimmed-down Fox, based on sports betting. The company soon paid $236 million for a 5% stake in Toronto online bookmaker the Stars Group which helped launch Fox Bet and owns the app.Combining Fox with News Corp could bring a larger audience to sports betting, potentially increasing the financial rewards for attracting new gamblers and gaining more lucrative sponsorships from sportsbooks eager to promote their apps, said one media executive.The Murdochs' early foray has been slow-going. The sports betting app Fox Bet is available in four states, with just 0.2% share of the U.S. market, according to researcher Vixio. A free version called Fox Bet Super 6 has attracted some 6 million users whom Fox hopes to eventually convert to gamblers.The growth of Fox Bet has stagnated since market-leading FanDuel's owner, Flutter Entertainment Plc, acquired Stars Group in 2020. The companies have been locked in a dispute over the price Fox would pay to exercise its option to buy 18.6% of FanDuel. The matter is the subject of an arbitration case and Lachlan Murdoch told investors a decision is expected imminently.News Corp has previously stumbled in sports betting. Last month, News' first direct investment in Australian bookmaking, Betr, went live ahead of the country's most-watched horse race, the Melbourne Cup. Within two days, an ad that ran in News Corp's tabloid newspapers triggered a regulator inquiry into whether the ads breached laws prohibiting inducement to gamble. Betr says it is cooperating with the regulator.Matt Davey, chairman of Las Vegas sports betting investment firm Tekkorp Digital Acquisition Corp, which co-invested with News Corp in Betr, said News had seized on its media reach in Australia, where it sells more than half of all newspapers and runs sports-heavy cable TV channel Foxtel, to create a ""pretty powerful combination"" of media and betting.At least one investor is waiting to be convinced that approach will work in the United States.""Fox has got a far-reaching audience so it does make sense, if you're going to launch (sports betting) into the U.S., that you have that Fox network, distribution and partnership,"" said John Ayoub, a portfolio manager at Sydney-based Wilson Asset Management, which owns News Corp's Australian-listed shares. ""But we'll probably need a little bit more detail.""(Reporting by Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles, Byron Kaye in Sydney, and Noel Randewich in Oakland, Calif.

""Exelon continues its strong operational performance, with ComEd and PECO achieving best on record SAIFI performance. We are on track to invest more than $6.9 billion at our electric and gas companies by year end to enhance reliability and resiliency. This ongoing infrastructure investment in our electric and gas companies is delivering solid financial and customer satisfaction results. Our consistent operational excellence, strategic and equitable investments in our communities, and significant regulatory milestones achieved this quarter will help ensure we deliver on our promise to provide safe, reliable, resilient and affordable service to our more than 10 million customers and value to our investors.""""Our third-quarter performance remained strong, with adjusted (non-GAAP) earnings of $0.75 per share which, after adjusting for discontinued operations, is $0.14 ahead of the same period last year driven in part by rate adjustments resulting from our continued investments at the utilities to improve reliability and service for customers,"" said Jeanne Jones, Exelon executive vice president and chief financial officer. ""Our excellent operational performance and progress on the regulatory front through the third quarter – with more on the horizon – is continued evidence that we are on the right path to achieve our long-term goals. To that end, we have narrowed our 2022 EPS guidance range to $2.21 to $2.29 per share, and reaffirmed our 6-8% earnings per share growth from 2021-2025.""Story continuesThird Quarter 2022Exelon's GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations for the third quarter of 2022 increased to $0.68 per share from $0.47 GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations per share in the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2022 increased to $0.75 per share from $0.53 per share in the third quarter of 2021. For the reconciliations of GAAP Net Income from Continuing Operations to Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings, refer to the tables beginning on page 4.Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings in the third quarter of 2022 primarily reflect:Higher utility earnings primarily due to higher electric distribution earnings at ComEd from higher allowed electric distribution ROE due to an increase in treasury rates and higher rate base, rate increases at PECO, BGE, and PHI, and decreases in storm costs at PECO and BGE, partially offset by higher depreciation expense at PECO and PHI.Higher earnings at the Exelon holding company due to certain BSC costs that were historically allocated to Constellation Energy Generation, LLC (Generation) but are presented as part of continuing operations in Exelon’s results in the third quarter of 2021 as these costs do not qualify as expenses of the discontinued operations per the accounting rules, partially offset by higher interest expense.Operating Company Results1ComEdComEd's third quarter of 2022 GAAP Net Income increased to $291 million from $220 million in the third quarter of 2021. ComEd's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2022 increased to $293 million from $224 million in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to increases in electric distribution formula rate earnings (reflecting higher allowed electric distribution ROE due to an increase in treasury rates and the impacts of higher rate base). Due to revenue decoupling, ComEd's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.PECOPECO’s third quarter of 2022 GAAP Net Income increased to $135 million from $111 million in the third quarter of 2021. PECO's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2022 increased to $174 million from $114 million in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to distribution rate increases and decreases in storm costs, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense.___________1Exelon’s four business units include ComEd, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in northern Illinois; PECO, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in southeastern Pennsylvania; BGE, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations and retail natural gas distribution operations in central Maryland; and PHI, which consists of electricity transmission and distribution operations in the District of Columbia and portions of Maryland, Delaware, and New Jersey and retail natural gas distribution operations in northern Delaware.BGEBGE’s third quarter of 2022 GAAP Net Income decreased to $33 million from $36 million in the third quarter of 2021. BGE's Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2022 increased to $70 million from $40 million in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to favorable impacts of the multi-year plans and decreases in storm costs. Due to revenue decoupling, BGE's distribution earnings are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.PHIPHI’s third quarter of 2022 GAAP Net Income increased to $289 million from $266 million in the third quarter of 2021. PHI’s Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings for the third quarter of 2022 increased to $286 million from $272 million in the third quarter of 2021, primarily due to distribution rate increases, partially offset by an increase in depreciation expense. Due to revenue decoupling, PHI's distribution earnings related to Pepco Maryland, DPL Maryland, Pepco District of Columbia, and ACE are not affected by actual weather or customer usage patterns.Recent Developments and Third Quarter HighlightsPECO Pennsylvania Natural Gas Distribution Rate Case: On October 27, 2022, the PAPUC issued an order approving a $55 million increase in PECO's annual natural gas distribution revenues. The rate increase was resolved through a settlement agreement, which did not specify an approved ROE. The rates are effective on January 1, 2023.DPL Delaware Natural Gas Base Rate Case: On October 12, 2022, the DEPSC approved an increase in DPL’s annual natural gas distribution rates of $8 million, reflecting an ROE of 9.60%.

Follow Exelon on Twitter @Exelon.Non-GAAP Financial MeasuresIn addition to net income as determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), Exelon evaluates its operating performance using the measure of Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings because management believes it represents earnings directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings exclude certain costs, expenses, gains and losses, and other specified items. This measure is intended to enhance an investor’s overall understanding of period over period operating results and provide an indication of Exelon’s baseline operating performance excluding items that are considered by management to be not directly related to the ongoing operations of the business. In addition, this measure is among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for evaluating performance, allocating resources, setting incentive compensation targets, and planning and forecasting of future periods. Adjusted (non-GAAP) Operating Earnings is not a presentation defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to other companies’ presentation. Exelon has provided the non-GAAP financial measure as supplemental information and in addition to the financial measures that are calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP.

The capital-intensive utility stocks were impacted by the ongoing increase in interest rates and rising operating costs, while new rates implemented in their service territories boosted revenues.Factors to ConsiderDomestic-focused companies operating in the sector are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure is allowing the utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation.Per the updated outlook of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the July-September 2022 average contiguous U.S. temperature was 73.0°F, 2.8°F above average. The above-average temperature during the summer months is likely to have spurred demand for water and electricity for cooling purposes, benefiting the utilities.A clear transition is evident in the Utilities space, with companies operating in this space gradually moving toward clean sources of fuel to produce electricity and lower emission. The stringent regulation of emissions, the high cost of conventional fuel and government incentives on the usage of clean fuel are also urging the utilities to focus more on clean energy sources. Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades.Utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, and are capital-intensive in nature. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels. The increase in borrowing costs and the possibility of more interest rate hikes this year may have further pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted earnings.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

Accordingly, the comparable baseline period is April 1, 2021, through March 31, 2022. Key points related to Under Armour's fiscal year 2023 outlook include:Revenue is expected to grow at a low single-digit percentage rate compared to the previous expectation of 5 to 7 percent growth due primarily to a more challenging retail environment and additional negative impacts from changes in foreign currency. Currency-neutral revenue is expected to be up at a mid-single-digit percentage rate compared to the previous expectation of 7 to 9 percent growth.Gross margin remains unchanged from the previous outlook of a 375 to 425 basis point decline.Selling, general &amp; administrative expenses are expected to be down slightly against the prior year as the company manages costs amid uncertain market conditions.Operating income is expected to reach $270 to $290 million compared to the previous range of $300 to $325 million. Excluding an expense related to ongoing litigation matters, adjusted operating income is expected to reach $290 to $310 million compared to the previous range of $310 to $335 million.Diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.56 to $0.60 compared to the previous expectation of $0.61 to $0.67. This includes a $0.28 benefit related to a tax valuation allowance release expected to be realized during the fiscal year. Of this $0.28 benefit, $0.16 is related to prior restructuring. Additionally, there is a $0.04 negative impact from a legal expense related to ongoing litigation matters. Excluding these net positive impacts of $0.12, adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be $0.44 to $0.48 compared to the previous expectation of $0.47 to $0.53.Capital expenditures remain unchanged from an expectation of approximately $225 million.Conference Call and WebcastUnder Armour will hold its second quarter fiscal 2023 conference call today at approximately 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.

Currency-neutral financial information is calculated to exclude changes in foreign currency exchange rates. References to adjusted financial measures exclude the effect of legal expenses related to ongoing litigation matters, the company's 2020 restructuring plan, and related impairment charges, including goodwill and related tax effects. Where applicable, adjusted net income (loss) and adjusted diluted income (loss) per share exclude the non-cash amortization of debt discount on the company's convertible senior notes, any gain or loss on extinguishing the company's convertible senior notes, and related tax effects, and any gain or loss from divestitures (including associated earn-outs and expenses) and related tax effects. Management believes these adjustments are not core to the company's operations. The reconciliation of non-GAAP amounts to the most directly comparable financial measure calculated according to GAAP is presented in supplemental financial information furnished with this release. All per-share amounts are reported on a diluted basis. In addition, in connection with its change in fiscal year-end from December 31 to March 31, Under Armour is presenting select non-GAAP financial measures for the twelve months beginning on April 1, 2021, and ending March 31, 2022, to provide comparable reference periods against the company's new fiscal 2023 year, which began April 1, 2022, and ends on March 31, 2023. These supplemental non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation. They should be contemplated in addition to, and not as an alternative to, the company's reported results prepared per GAAP. Additionally, the company's non-GAAP financial information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.About Under Armour, Inc.Under Armour, Inc., headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, is a leading inventor, marketer, and distributor of branded athletic performance apparel, footwear, and accessories.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues stands at $1,555 million, indicating a marginal increase of about 0.6% from the prior-year period’s reported figure.The bottom line of this developer, marketer and distributor of apparel, footwear and accessories is expected to decrease from the prior-year quarter’s reading. The Zacks Consensus Estimate of 16 cents for earnings per share in the second quarter has been stable over the past 30 days. The figure suggests a sharp decline from the earnings of 31 cents reported in the year-ago period.This Baltimore, MD-based player has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 28.8%, on average.Key Things to NoteThe second quarter of fiscal 2023 might have been another soft one for Under Armour, at least consensus numbers say so. A competitive landscape, supply-chain issues and higher shipping costs might have hurt the company’s performance. Also, a highly promotional environment and adverse foreign currency might have been added deterrents.On its last earnings call, Under Armour guided second-quarter revenues to be flat to up marginally on a reported basis and rise at a low-to-mid-single-digit rate on a currency-neutral basis. This includes about five percentage points of headwinds from proactive reductions and cancellations to order books due to pandemic-related supply constraints.Management projected a gross margin contraction of approximately 550 to 600 basis points for the second quarter due to an adverse impact of elevated promotional activities, higher freight expenses, shifts and a channel mix and increasing pressures from changes in foreign currency.The company guided the second-quarter operating income between $105 million and $115 million, down from the adjusted operating income of $188.8 million in the year-ago period. It envisions earnings in the band of 15 cents-17 cents a share, down from the adjusted earnings of 31 cents reported in the prior-year quarter.On the flip side, Under Armour’s robust operating model, strength in the direct-to-consumer business and investments in products and marketing might have cushioned its quarterly performance. The company’s strategy to focus on improving sales through product innovation, investments in its stores and acceleration of e-commerce capabilities and selling more inventory at a full price bodes well.Story continuesUnder Armour, Inc.

I referenced a Reuters article that reported, as of June 17, Wall Street expected S&amp;P 500 earnings to grow by 9.6% in 2022, which was up from 8.8% in April and from 8.4% in January. That tune began to change at the end of July and accelerated in August and September, as major players, such as Ford (NYSE:F), have recently issued profit warnings and/or have withdrawn guidance. In response, Wall Street has altered its outlook: lowering third-quarter profit growth to 4.6% from 7.2% in early August and slashing full-year profit growth to 4.5%.” Click to continue reading and see Goldman Sachs Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Large-Cap Stock Picks.  Suggested articles:11 Best Healthcare Dividend Stocks To Buy10 Cheap Small Cap Stocks To Invest In10 Best Utility Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP, or Expected Surprise Prediction, aims to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions. The basic premise is that if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate ahead of an earnings release, it means they likely have new information that could possibly be more accurate. The core of the ESP model is comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, where the resulting percentage difference between the two equals the Expected Surprise Prediction.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Helmerich &amp; Payne (HP) earns a Zacks Rank #1 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.49 a share, just 14 days from its upcoming earnings release on November 16, 2022.HP has an Earnings ESP figure of 14.32%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.49 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.43.HP is one of just a large database of Oils-Energy stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is PBF Energy (PBF).Slated to report earnings on February 9, 2023, PBF Energy holds a #1 (Strong Buy) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $5.56 a share 99 days from its next quarterly update.PBF Energy's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 33.49% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.16.Story continuesBecause both stocks hold a positive Earnings ESP, HP and PBF could potentially post earnings beats in their next reports.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Colgate-PalmoliveIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chairman, Noel Wallace, sold US$11m worth of shares at a price of US$77.18 per share. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$73.74. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern.Colgate-Palmolive insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. The chart below shows insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Colgate-Palmolive better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of Colgate-PalmoliveMany investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. A high insider ownership often makes company leadership more mindful of shareholder interests. It appears that Colgate-Palmolive insiders own 0.1% of the company, worth about US$63m. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Colgate-Palmolive Tell Us?It doesn't really mean much that no insider has traded Colgate-Palmolive shares in the last quarter. We don't take much encouragement from the transactions by Colgate-Palmolive insiders. But it's good to see that insiders own shares in the company. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company.

Related findings include:Younger generations continue to drive the Great Resignation: One-third of millennials and 46% of Gen Z have switched employers since the start of the pandemic — a stark contrast compared to 29% of all workers.Job-hopping for paycheck-bumping: Younger generations are more likely to say that the best way to increase their earning potential is to change employers every few years, with 41% of millennial workers and 44% of Gen Z workers expressing this belief, compared to 36% of all workers.Younger generations look to employers for help: Almost 6 in 10 Gen Z (58%) and millennial (57%) workers believe their employer has a responsibility to help them feel more financially empowered.Flexibility strong against the dollar: Conversely, over the past year, 29% of millennials who switched jobs took a pay cut, with more than 1 in 4 millennials who took a pay cut explaining they did so in order to achieve a better work/life balance.""Millennials are acutely attuned to the benefits of a hybrid working model. As the largest generational cohort in the U.S. workforce,1 and at Prudential, nearly 40% of our employees in the U.S. are millennials, the demand for flexibility in when and where we work is not going anywhere — hybrid demand is here to stay,"" said Prudential Vice Chair Rob Falzon. ""The biggest opportunity for employers is to fully embrace this new era and redefine the workplace to best meet the needs of employees — regardless of where they are in their lives.""Story continuesHybrid and happy: According to the survey, 70% of hybrid workers report feeling a strong sense of loyalty to their employer, compared to 64% of in-person and 59% of remote workers. Hybrid workers are also more likely to say they feel fairly compensated for the work they do (68%) and that the benefits their employer provides are tailored to their individual needs (64%).One watch-out for employers is that many Americans report their main source of income is not enough to pay the bills or save for the future. Turning to gig work, going into debt, or receiving financial support from relatives to close the gap has become the norm:Salary not sufficing: 49% of millennials and 48% of Gen Z don’t believe that a salary is going to be enough to achieve their financial goals.Growth in gig work: 70% of all workers have pursued or considered pursuing gig work to supplement their income over the past year. This is even higher among Gen Z (81%) and millennials (77%) — roughly a quarter of whom hope that their gig work will one day be their full-time job.Gig work seen as a temporary option: Most workers who are considering or are pursuing gig work (34%) say they are only doing it until their main source of income can fully sustain their financial needs.Notably, younger generations feel acute challenges — and anxiety — about managing money, struggling to balance ""living in the now"" with saving for the long term. Overall, without taking steps and becoming more proactive about their long-term financial security, their outlook is bleak:Looking to others for financial help: Half of millennials say they regularly run out of money and have to rely on credit cards or family for financial support, and 65% of millennials and Gen Z have received financial support in the past two years from either parents, significant others, relatives or grandparents.Emergency savings funds in crisis: 50% of all respondents have less than $500 or no emergency savings fund. Nearly 4 in 10 (39%) of both millennials and Gen Z report having no emergency savings at all.Debt taking a toll: 55% of millennials say that debt is preventing them from accomplishing personal goals, such as owning a home and having kids; 33% of millennials and 32% of Gen Z say student loan debt is a barrier to accomplishing those personal goals.Social obligations turn financial burden: 46% of millennials and 48% of Gen Z say they’d be able to spend more on personal goals if they did not have to spend on friends’ and family members’ life milestones like wedding gifts, baby gifts, or milestone birthday celebrations and gifts.Not keeping a budget or prioritizing investing: Nearly 70% of millennials and Gen Z do not keep a formal budget; 44% of Gen Z and 38% of millennials do not invest.""Without keeping an eye on finances, it can be easy for good spending and savings habits to slip. As a millennial myself, I know how tough it can be to balance financial responsibility with having a social life,"" says Brandon Goldstein, ChFC®, Financial Planner with Prudential Financial. ""I attended a handful of weddings this year — and the expenses for gifts and travel really added up. That’s why it’s imperative to assess and prioritize what’s critical, so you can stick within your budget and not lose sight of your long-term financial goals, too.""The survey also revealed some sobering insights around women, who are facing more precarious financial situations than men:A shaky situation: 4 in 10 women (41%) strongly agree that the economic environment has made them more concerned about their financial security (compared to 34% of men). Alarmingly, only 56% of all women have an emergency savings account (compared to 73% of men).Income is stretched: More than half of women (53%) say they cannot afford their current lifestyle or are barely getting by — just 40% of men say the same.Feeling the stress: More than one-third of women (36%) report experiencing health or mental health issues as a result of financial stress (versus 28% of men). More than 4 in 10 women (45%) say they have trouble sleeping for the same reason (versus 36% of men).""The pandemic had a disproportionate impact on women, both professionally and financially,"" says Caroline Feeney, CEO of Prudential’s U.S. Insurance &amp; Retirement Businesses. ""At Prudential, we seek to understand the life events that impact today’s women and the barriers they face when it comes to investing, insurance, and retirement security. We want to help solve financial challenges for all by designing and tailoring solutions to meet unique needs and financial wellness goals.""For additional insights from the Pulse survey, please visit news.prudential.com/pulse.

QuoteBehind the HeadlinesTotal revenues of $21.6 billion increased 10% year over year on higher premiums. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 69.4%. The figure was higher than our estimate of $12.8 billion.Total benefits and expenses of $20.6 billion were up 15.5% year over year for the quarter. The increase in expenses was mainly attributable to higher insurance and annuity benefits and interest expense. The figure was higher than our estimate of $11.6 billion.Quarterly Segment UpdatePGIM reported adjusted operating income of $219 million,  decreased 33% year over year. This decrease reflects lower asset management fees, due to a reduction in assets under management.U.S. Businesses’ adjusted operating income was $702 million, down 35.6% from the year-ago quarter. This decrease reflects lower net investment spread results, due to lower variable investment income, and lower net fee income. It was partially offset by favorable underwriting results.Assurance IQ incurred adjusted operating loss of $44 million, narrower than a loss of $55 million in the year-ago quarter. This lower loss reflects lower expenses, partially offset by lower revenues, due to less case referral income.International Businesses delivered adjusted operating income of $430 million, down 51.5% from the year-earlier period. This decrease reflects less favorable underwriting results and lower net investment spread results, due to lower variable investment income.Corporate and other operations incurred adjusted operating loss of $325 million, narrower than a loss of $460 million  a year ago. This lower loss reflects the absence of costs related to the early extinguishment of debt in the year-ago quarter, gains from the sales of certain home office properties, favorable foreign exchange rate impacts and higher income from pension and other employee benefit plans.Story continuesShare Repurchase UpdatePrudential returned capital worth $829 million in the quarter, including $375 million of share repurchases and $454 million of dividends.Dividends paid were $1.20 per share, representing a 5% yield on adjusted book value.Financial UpdateCash and cash equivalents of $20.1 billion at quarter-end increased 28.8% year over year.

PWR is scheduled to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 3, before the opening bell.In the last-reported quarter, the company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2% and grew 45.2% year over year. Total revenues surpassed the consensus mark by 5.3% and increased 41.1% year over year.Encouragingly, earnings topped analysts’ expectations in 13 of the trailing 14 quarters.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings remained unchanged at $1.77 per share over the past 60 days. The estimated figure indicates a 19.6% increase from the year-ago earnings of $1.48 per share. The consensus mark for revenues is $4.38 billion, suggesting a 30.6% year-over-year rise.Quanta Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseQuanta Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseQuanta Services, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Quanta Services, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteDevelopment and deployment of technology solutions across the full spectrum of decarbonization efforts, including carbon management mitigation and compliance consulting, as well as all facets of infrastructure for providing carbon-free energy solutions, will benefit the company in the to-be-reported quarter.The company has been capitalizing on the megatrends to lead the energy transition and enable technological development. Initiatives such as electric vehicle charging infrastructure and undergrounding of electrical infrastructure are gaining momentum. These factors should help the company to boost its profit level.Segment-wise, the Electric Power Infrastructure Services segment (accounting for almost 59% of total revenues) is likely to have benefited from broad-based business strength driven by ongoing grid modernization, system hardening, renewable energy interconnections and solid execution.Also, contributions from larger transmission projects underway in Canada and revenues from the acquired businesses are likely to have supported bottom-line growth in the to-be-reported quarter. Higher profitability from the LUMA joint venture and other integral unconsolidated affiliates, along with communications and electric operations, might have added to the positives.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Electric Power segment’s revenues is pegged at $2,146 million, implying a decline from $2,328 million a year ago.The Underground Utility and Infrastructure Solutions segment (accounting for almost 14% of total revenues) has been benefiting from higher demand for gas utility and pipeline integrity services and pent-up demand for the services that were deferred due to the effects of COVID-19 on the downstream market.Meanwhile, the Renewable Energy Infrastructure Solutions segment — consists of services and solutions for infrastructure supporting the delivery of renewable energy — including renewable generation, electric transmission, substations and battery storage, with Blattner's operations representing the majority of those solutions. This addition is expected to have contributed to the company’s top line in the quarter.Story continuesWhat the Zacks Model SaysOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Quanta Services this time around.

However, higher diesel fuel costs and inflationary pressures for many other parts and supplies weighed on the bottom line.Looking ahead, chairman and CEO Tom Hill said, “As we look ahead to 2023, leading indicators suggest that growing public construction activity, particularly highways, and the recovery in private nonresidential contract awards should help to offset contracting single-family residential demand.

This upside was led by double-digit growth in the company's legacy operations as well as the addition of acquired businesses.Segments in DetailAggregatesRevenues from the segment increased 27.1% year over year to $1,490.5 million, owing to higher demand across all end-market segments. Aggregate shipments (volumes) increased 9% year over year (up 3% on a same-store basis).

419,53bcd1ad-b01c-32ae-a3b8-b2a2ec54c426,URI,2022-11-03,4 Stocks to Buy on a Rise in September Construction Spending,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-stocks-buy-rise-september-123512224.html,1667392512,STORY,"['JHX', 'URI', 'GVA', 'JHX.AX', 'EME']","[Spending on construction projects, rising until a few months back, has been declining. The homebuilding industry has been the biggest casualty of the Fed’s aggressive rate hike policy, which has seen a steady decline in spending on construction projects.However, construction spending rose unexpectedly in September, indicating that inflation might be easing. The rise was primarily driven by spending on non-residential structures like mining and oil well drilling and government projects. Given this scenario, stocks like EMCOR Group, Inc. EME, Granite Construction Incorporated GVA, James Hardie Industries plc JHX and United Rentals, Inc. URI are likely to benefit in the near term.Construction Spending Increases Despite ChallengesThe U.S. Census Bureau said on Nov 1 that spending on construction projects rose 0.2% to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $1,811.1 billion in September after declining 0.6% in August. Economists had expected construction spending to decline 0.5%.Moreover, on a year-over-year basis, construction spending increased 10.9% in September. At the end of the third quarter, or the completion of the first nine months of the year, spending on construction projects totaled $1,353.7 billion, 11.4% higher than the same period last year.Spending on private construction projects increased 0.4% in September after declining 0.7% in August. However, the homebuilding sector, which has been primarily driving spending on construction projects for months, continued its decline.Spending on residential construction projects remained unchanged month over month in September, with spending on single-family homes declining 2.6%. Spending on multi-family housing projects rose 0.3% in September.The homebuilding market has been suffering the most as mortgage rates continue to climb as a result of higher interest rates being imposed by the Fed in its fight to curb soaring inflation. However, economic data released last week showed hinted at easing inflation. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index rose 0.3% month over month in September and 6.2% on an annual basis, unchanged from August.Story continuesThis has given people the feeling that inflation might be easing and the Fed might go slow on its aggressive monetary policy after its rate hike in November. The Fed is expected to increase interest rates by another 75 basis points after its two-day policy meeting, which begins on Nov 2. Investors believe this could be the last of major rate hikes by the Fed.If the Fed goes slow on its next rate hikes, the homebuilding industry will likely benefit the most. That said, construction spending in September was driven by private non-residential structures like gas and oil well drilling, which increased 1%. Also, spending on state and local government construction projects gained 0.6%.Our ChoicesGiven this scenario, it will be prudent to invest in stocks with a favorable Zacks Rank that are poised to gain from the rise in construction spending. We narrowed down our search to four such stocks. Each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.EMCOR Group, Inc. is one of the leading providers of mechanical and electrical construction, industrial and energy infrastructure, as well as building services for a diverse range of businesses.

420,67a1292d-1528-3f7f-a988-af7bf3f25991,ORCL,2022-11-03,Oracle Announces New Technology Suite for Public Safety,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-announces-technology-suite-public-115500046.html,1667476500,STORY,['ORCL'],"[Unified public safety hardware and software suite provides first responders advanced tools to improve efficiency and real-time situational awareness that can help improve issue resolutionAUSTIN, Texas, Nov. 3, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Oracle announced Oracle Public Safety Services, a new technology platform for law enforcement and first responders. The platform provides a unified hardware and software suite that is designed to remove data silos, eliminate manual busy work, and empower first responders with real-time information and situational awareness to help them make more objective decisions when every second counts. The suite includes dispatch command center, law enforcement records, and jail management software, as well as body worn devices and real-time video communication tools.(PRNewsfoto/Oracle)""First responders have one of the hardest jobs imaginable, yet technology has not evolved to support them in making informed decisions that foster accountability and safer incident resolutions,"" said Steve Seoane, senior vice president and general manager, Oracle Local Government. ""Oracle has a deep history in solving the complex problems of the world's most essential industries. We are bringing this expertise to public safety to provide our first responders with the cutting-edge technology they need to better serve our communities.""Integrated Mission-Critical Technology Purpose-Built for Public SafetyOracle Public Safety Services were created in partnership with local government, Police and Sheriffs' personnel, Fire and EMS professionals, and leading law enforcement technology experts. Built on the performance and scalability of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), the suite is CJIS1 compliant and enables agencies of all sizes to get up and running quickly to help lower costs and complexity while enhancing security. The suite includes:Dispatch Command Center: A cloud-based computer-aided dispatch (CAD) system for emergency call management and dispatch. The system enables command center operators to speed data entry, increase accuracy, and accelerate dispatch by auto-populating 911 call information, identifying and merging duplicate calls, providing ""next word"" text suggestions, and verifying the incident location in a blended map view. Built-in intelligence tools can also provide critical information about the location and subjects. For example, the system can note if a home is known to have a person with mental health issues based on past incidents. This can help dispatch assign personnel best equipped to handle the situation versus just the closest officer.Wearable Computer Devices: Are officer-worn communications and camera systems which can activate automatically upon dispatch and record interactions between law enforcement and community members to support transparency, trust, and accountability. Oracle's unique streaming and connectivity capabilities also enable agencies to provide video line-of-sight to a team member at a remote location, such as a command center, to give on-scene responders more guidance and support as an event is unfolding. The dispatch, verbal, and video data can be automatically pulled into a case report file in real time which can save officers hours of reporting paperwork daily.Personal Communications System: A mobile application that runs on a secure mobile device and facilitates dispatch and field-based interactions between first responders. Automated location and subject-based alerts enhance situational awareness and safety for officers and citizens. In addition, camera-based vehicle license plate and driver's license scanning, and full integration with the Dispatch and Records Management Systems, can make it easy to initiate local records searches and view and update case information via the officer's mobile device.Vehicle Communications: A new touch-talk-listen tablet application redefines the in-car experience by providing officers more focused, actionable data 'at-a-glance'. This can include key information from dispatch, navigation details, and field-based interactions between first responders and the command center. With a few touch-points responders can pull-up complete records searches and case reporting and view a fully interactive map for better visibility into all other incidents and units in the area.Vehicle Video Cameras: A roof-mounted video camera bar with a front and peripheral view camera array, a dedicated automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) camera, as well as an in-vehicle computer to process video streaming and recording. The system leverages connected hardware to provide a 300-degree view of the incident. Like the body worn cameras, data and video feeds from the hardware and software can be displayed in real-time to all parties supporting that event.Records Management: A records management system designed to manage all public safety records for an agency, including entry, storage, retrieval, viewing, and archiving of crime reports, property and evidence, and investigative data. Fully integrated with Oracle Public Safety dispatch and mobile services, the system can automatically link and auto populates 911 call incident details and mobile case reporting data, eliminating the need for duplicate data entry.Jail Management: A cloud-based jail and holding-facility management system designed to eliminate data re-entry and enable more efficient, secure processes from pre-booking to transfer or release.Story continues""Time is not a luxury first responders have in a rapidly unfolding emergency situation,"" added Seoane. ""We designed our systems to make the on-scene experience less isolating and emotionally charged by enabling responders to act as a blended team with someone monitoring the situation remotely. With this approach, on-site officers gain support and guidance that can change the course of a dangerous incident by helping reduce risk, and hopefully increasing the likelihood of a more constructive resolution for everyone involved.""To learn more about Oracle Public Safety Services, visit https://www.oracle.com/industries/government/state-local/public-safety/1FBI's Criminal Justice Information ServicesAbout OracleOracle offers integrated suites of applications plus secure, autonomous infrastructure in the Oracle Cloud. For more information about Oracle (NYSE: ORCL), please visit us at oracle.com.TrademarksOracle, Java, and MySQL are registered trademarks of Oracle Corporation. CisionView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/oracle-announces-new-technology-suite-for-public-safety-301667284.htmlSOURCE Oracle]"

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this software maker have returned +17.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.7% change. The Zacks Computer - Software industry, to which Oracle belongs, has gained 2.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Oracle is expected to post earnings of $1.17 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of -3.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -0.5%.The consensus earnings estimate of $4.97 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +1.4%. This estimate has changed -0.3% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.54 indicates a change of +11.5% from what Oracle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.4%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Oracle is rated Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for ORCL _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Oracle, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $12.04 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +16.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $49.59 billion and $52.91 billion estimates indicate +16.8% and +6.7% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryOracle reported revenues of $11.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +17.7%. EPS of $1.03 for the same period compares with $1.03 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $11.47 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -0.18%. The EPS surprise was -3.74%.Over the last four quarters, Oracle surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates three times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Oracle is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Oracle. However, its Zacks Rank #4 does suggest that it may underperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The figure also increased 20.8% year over year.Quarterly revenues of $1.09 billion exceeded the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.07 billion. Moreover, revenues increased 21.6% year over year.Results reflect better-than-anticipated top-line growth alongside an improvement in the realized annual rent per occupied square foot. The company also benefited from its expansion efforts through acquisitions, developments and extensions. It raised its guidance for 2022 FFO per share. After PS Business Parks’ (“PSB”) merger with Blackstone on Jul 20, 2022, PSA received a total of $2.7 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of its equity investment in PSB. The transaction resulted in a gain of $2.1 billion.Behind the HeadlinesPublic Storage’s same-store revenues increased 14.7% year over year to $822.5 million in the third quarter, highlighting the higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot, partially offset by a decline in occupancy. This REIT experienced a 17.2% increase in the realized annual rental income per occupied square foot to $22.52. However, the weighted-average square foot occupancy of 94.5% was down 2.4% year over year.The same-store cost of operations increased 7.7% year over year, mainly reflecting a rise in property tax expense, marketing expense, other direct property costs and centralized management costs.Consequently, PSA’s same-store net operating income (NOI) increased 17% to $632.6 million. Also, this REIT’s NOI growth from non-same-store facilities was $56.5 million due to the facilities acquired in 2021 and the fill-up of recently developed and expanded facilities.Public Storage achieved an 80.3% same-store direct NOI margin in the quarter, reflecting an increase of 1.6% year over year.Portfolio ActivityIn the September quarter, Public Storage acquired 24 self-storage facilities comprising 1.7 million net rentable square feet of area for $250.6 million. Following Sep 30, 2022, the company acquired or was under contract to buy 33 self-storage facilities spanning 1.7 million net rentable square feet of space across six states for $262.6 million.In the third quarter, this REIT opened five newly developed facilities and completed several expansion projects with 0.5 million net rentable square feet costing $69.7 million.As of Sep 30, 2022, PSA had several facilities in development (2.1 million net rentable square feet) with an estimated cost of $421 million and several expansion projects (3.0 million net rentable square feet) worth $590.9 million. It expects to incur the remaining $605.5 million of development costs related to these projects, mainly over the next 18 to 24 months.Story continuesBalance Sheet PositionPublic Storage exited third-quarter 2022 with $883.8 of cash and equivalents, down from $1.01 billion as of Jun 30, 2022.Dividend UpdateOn Oct 26, 2022, the company’s board announced a regular quarterly dividend of $2 per common share. The dividend will be paid out on Dec 29 to shareholders on record as of Dec 14, 2022.On Aug 4, 2022, in relation to the sale of PSA’s equity investment in PSB, it paid out a special cash dividend of $13.15 per common share, aggregating around $2.3 billion, to shareholders on record as of Aug 1, 2022.2022 Guidance UpPublic Storage increased its guidance for 2022 core FFO per share after including the impact of the sale of its investment in PSB.It now projects the same in the range of $15.35-$15.75, up from the prior guidance of $15.00-$15.70. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same stands at $15.73, which lies in the guided range.The company’s full-year assumption is backed by 13.5-15% growth in same-store revenues, a 6% to 8% rise in same-store expenses and a 15.4% to 18.0% expansion in same-store NOI. Further, the company expects $800 million in acquisitions and $250 million in development openings.Public Storage currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

Follow FIS on Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter (@FISGlobal).FIS Use of Non-GAAP Financial InformationGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) is the term used to refer to the standard framework of guidelines for financial accounting in the United States. GAAP includes the standards, conventions, and rules accountants follow in recording and summarizing transactions and in the preparation of financial statements. In addition to reporting financial results in accordance with GAAP, we have provided certain non-GAAP financial measures.These non-GAAP measures include constant currency revenue, organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margin, adjusted net earnings, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. These non-GAAP measures may be used in this release and/or in the attached supplemental financial information.We believe these non-GAAP measures help investors better understand the underlying fundamentals of our business. As further described below, the non-GAAP revenue and earnings measures presented eliminate items management believes are not indicative of FIS’ operating performance. The constant currency and organic revenue growth measures adjust for the effects of exchange rate fluctuations, while organic revenue growth also adjusts for acquisitions and divestitures and excludes revenue from Corporate and Other, giving investors further insight into our performance. Finally, free cash flow provides further information about the ability of our business to generate cash. For these reasons, management also uses these non-GAAP measures in its assessment and management of FIS’ performance.Constant currency revenue represents reported operating segment revenue excluding the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in the current period.Organic revenue growth is constant currency revenue, as defined above, for the current period compared to an adjusted revenue base for the prior period, which is adjusted to add pre-acquisition revenue of acquired businesses for a portion of the prior year matching the portion of the current year for which the business was owned, and subtract pre-divestiture revenue for divested businesses for the portion of the prior year matching the portion of the current year for which the business was not owned, for any acquisitions or divestitures by FIS. When referring to organic revenue growth, revenues from our Corporate and Other segment, which is comprised of revenue from non-strategic businesses, are excluded.Adjusted EBITDA reflects net earnings before interest, other income (expense), taxes, equity method investment earnings (loss), and depreciation and amortization, and excludes certain costs and other transactions that management deems non-operational in nature, or that otherwise improve the comparability of operating results across reporting periods by their exclusion. It also excludes incremental and direct costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This measure is reported to the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing their performance. For this reason, adjusted EBITDA, as it relates to our segments, is presented in conformity with Accounting Standards Codification 280, Segment Reporting, and is excluded from the definition of non-GAAP financial measures under the Securities and Exchange Commission's Regulation G and Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K.Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects adjusted EBITDA, as defined above, divided by revenue.Adjusted net earnings excludes the impact of certain costs and other transactions which management deems non-operational in nature, or that otherwise improve the comparability of operating results across reporting periods by their exclusion. It also excludes the impact of acquisition-related purchase accounting amortization and equity method investment earnings (loss), both of which are recurring. It also excludes incremental and direct costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.Adjusted EPS reflects adjusted net earnings, as defined above, divided by weighted average diluted shares outstanding.Free cash flow reflects net cash provided by operating activities, adjusted for the net change in settlement assets and obligations and excluding certain transactions that are closely associated with non-operating activities or are otherwise non-operational in nature and not indicative of future operating cash flows, including incremental and direct costs resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, less capital expenditures excluding capital expenditures related to the Company’s new headquarters. Free cash flow does not represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures, since we have mandatory debt service requirements and other non-discretionary expenditures that are not deducted from the measure.Any non-GAAP measures should be considered in context with the GAAP financial presentation and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for GAAP measures. Further, FIS’ non-GAAP measures may be calculated differently from similarly titled measures of other companies. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP measures to related GAAP measures, including footnotes describing the specific adjustments, are provided in the attached schedules and in the Investor Relations section of the FIS website, www.fisglobal.com.Forward-Looking StatementsThis earnings release and today’s webcast contain ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the U.S. federal securities laws.

FIS is set to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 3, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the financial solutions provider’s adjusted earnings per share of $1.73 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.8% due to strong performances across all segments. Large client wins and new sales momentum were some of the major positives in the quarter despite facing an uncertain macro environment.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the third-quarter 2022 earnings announcement.Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter earnings per share of $1.75 has witnessed one upward movement in the past week and none in the opposite direction. The estimate is indicative of a 1.2% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported earnings of $1.73 per share. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $3.6 billion, suggesting a rise of 2.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Fidelity National’s earnings beat estimates in each of the trailing four quarters, the average being 1.8%. This is depicted in the graph below.Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. Price and EPS Surprise Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseFidelity National Information Services, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Fidelity National Information Services, Inc. QuoteFactors to NoteFidelity National is likely to have continued benefiting from the digital transformation of the global economy in the third quarter. Rising investments in mobile banking and product expansion are also expected to have played a major role in boosting the company’s performance. FIS’s investments in technology and innovation across high-growth markets are anticipated to have helped expand its total addressable market in the quarter.Fidelity National’s acquisition of Payrix is likely to have supported its Banking Solutions unit’s profits. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for third-quarter adjusted EBITDA from this unit suggests a 3.2% increase from the prior quarter’s reported figure. Also, the consensus estimate for the segment signals a 3.7% year-over-year rise.Story continuesIn the third quarter, cross-border travel is likely to have witnessed a sharp increase. This is expected to have boosted the demand for FIS’ e-commerce payment gateway and the new payment platform. As such, the consensus estimate for adjusted EBITDA in Merchant Solutions indicates a 4.5% year-over-year rise. This is anticipated to have positioned the company for year-over-year growth in profits. The consensus estimate for segmental revenues indicates a 4.1% year-over-year increase.However, the consensus mark for the Capital Market Solutions unit’s adjusted EBITDA signals a 2.2% decrease from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure. Also, the upgradations of platforms and applications are expected to have increased the company’s costs in the September-end quarter.Also, a rising expense base primarily due to higher salaries and benefits, as well as some inflationary pressures, is likely to have affected the bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter, making an earnings beat uncertain.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Fidelity National this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat. That is not the case here, as you will see below.Earnings ESP: The company’s Earnings ESP is -0.33%. The Most Accurate Estimate is currently pegged at $1.74 per share, lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.75.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Zacks Rank: Fidelity National currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Fidelity National, here are some companies in the broader Business Services space that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to post an earnings beat this time around:Shift4 Payments, Inc.

Alex, what are the details in this latest earnings spree?ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Well, Jared, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve today. But we are still in the throes of earnings season, with a lot of headliners this morning. One of them is Estee Lauder. Shares were down about 6% at last glance after the company indicated that it wouldn't see a return to growth until 2023. Estee Lauder slashed its full-year forecast, blaming lockdowns in China and also saying that some retailers are taking its cosmetics and perfumes off of their shelves amid worries of an economic slowdown.Notable also that this announcement comes ahead of a crucial holiday season for them. The company now expects net sales for 2023 to decrease to 6% to 8% compared to its prior forecast of growth of 3% to 5%. And like its peers in the consumer discretionary sector, such as Nike and Levi's, it's also citing currency headwinds as a stronger dollar eats into its international profits.Now, makeup demand might be slowing down, but people are still lining up to KFC and Taco Bell. Yum Brands missed estimates on earnings per share, also citing currency headwinds and a loss in profits from its KFC exit from Russia. But it did report rising sales across its fast food chains, even as fast food restaurants are raising prices to keep up with rising commodity and labor costs. People are still flocking to them, opting for more value-oriented options. We saw that with McDonald's last week as they shy away from more expensive dine out options amid inflation.And finally, Paramount Global is also a mover today. Shares were down as much as 10% this morning after the company missed Wall Street estimates on third quarter earnings. Paramount's profit hit was the result of larger investments in content to boost its business, while weakness in advertising revenue also weighed on the quarter. The company did cite growth in its global streaming services. But that wasn't enough to appease Wall Street.- Interesting mix of companies there. And I got to tell you, I can testify to those higher makeup prices. But I still got to be a buyer. So thank you for that report, Alex Semenova.]"

This compares to earnings of $1.22 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of -4.39%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this parent company of KFC, Taco Bell and Pizza Hut would post earnings of $1.08 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.05, delivering a surprise of -2.78%.Over the last four quarters, the company has not been able to surpass consensus EPS estimates.Yum , which belongs to the Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, posted revenues of $1.64 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.14%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.61 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Yum shares have lost about 14.9% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.1%.What's Next for Yum?While Yum has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Yum: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.24 on $1.92 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $4.52 on $6.74 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Retail - Restaurants is currently in the top 22% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Restaurant Brands (QSR), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 3.This operator of Burger King and Tim Hortons restaurant chains is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +5.3%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.2% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.Restaurant Brands' revenues are expected to be $1.67 billion, up 11.8% from the year-ago quarter.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.McDonald's hasn't been tracking well recently as its declining earnings compare poorly to other companies, which have seen some growth on average. One possibility is that the P/E is high because investors think this poor earnings performance will turn the corner. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason. Check out our latest analysis for McDonald's peWant the full picture on analyst estimates for the company? Then our free report on McDonald's will help you uncover what's on the horizon.How Is McDonald's' Growth Trending?The only time you'd be truly comfortable seeing a P/E as steep as McDonald's' is when the company's growth is on track to outshine the market decidedly.If we review the last year of earnings, dishearteningly the company's profits fell to the tune of 18%. Unfortunately, that's brought it right back to where it started three years ago with EPS growth being virtually non-existent overall during that time. Accordingly, shareholders probably wouldn't have been overly satisfied with the unstable medium-term growth rates.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 15% per year over the next three years. With the market only predicted to deliver 9.5% per year, the company is positioned for a stronger earnings result.With this information, we can see why McDonald's is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Apparently shareholders aren't keen to offload something that is potentially eyeing a more prosperous future.Story continuesThe Bottom Line On McDonald's' P/ETypically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.As we suspected, our examination of McDonald's' analyst forecasts revealed that its superior earnings outlook is contributing to its high P/E. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless these conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.Having said that, be aware  McDonald's is showing 1 warning sign in our investment analysis, you should know about.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

Carey (WPC) This Earnings Season?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/whats-store-w-p-carey-145002945.html,1667400602,STORY,"['WPC', 'PLD', 'ARE', 'DEI']","[W. P. Carey Inc. WPC is set to report third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 4 before market open. Both its quarterly revenues and funds from operations (FFO) per share are likely to have witnessed year-over-year growth.In the last reported quarter, this New York-based net lease REIT delivered a surprise of 1.55% for the adjusted FFO per share.  Over the trailing four quarters, W. P. Carey’s adjusted FFO per share surpassed estimates on three occasions and missed the same on the other, the average surprise being 2.36%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:W.P. Carey Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseW.P. Carey Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseW.P. Carey Inc. price-eps-surprise | W.P. Carey Inc. QuoteThis diversified net lease REIT specializes in sale-leasebacks, build-to-suits and the acquisition of single-tenant net lease properties. WPC focuses on investing in high-quality single-tenant industrial, warehouse, office, retail and self-storage properties, mainly in the United States and Northern and Western Europe.W. P. Carey is poised to benefit from its portfolio of operationally-critical commercial real estate, which it leases back to creditworthy tenants on a long-term basis with built-in rent escalators. Having contractual rent escalators covering nearly the entire portfolio is a saving grace in the current inflationary environment and indicates credit strength.WPC is also focused on capitalizing on accretive investment opportunities. These investments come as part of the company’s external growth strategy and diversified approach.The third quarter has been notable for the company, with W. P. Carey completing the $2.7 billion merger with Corporate Property Associates 18 - Global Incorporated (""CPA:18""). For WPC, the move added a well-diversified and high-quality net lease portfolio, aiding certain portfolio metrics. Per the company, this merger was immediately accretive to the real estate adjusted FFO per share, offsetting the pre-merger income earned from managing CPA:18.Amid these, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter revenues is pegged at $378.91 million, indicating a 16.32% increase from the prior-year quarter.The consensus estimate for lease revenues for the third quarter is currently pegged at $346.74 million, ahead of the prior-year quarter figure of $314.19 million.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues from real estate ownership is presently pegged at $374.89 million, up from the $320.84 reported in the year-ago quarter. However, the consensus estimate for asset management revenues stands at $1.40 million, lower than the prior-year period’s reported figure of $3.87 million.However, the choppiness in the economy and the rising geopolitical tension and its impact on economic activity might affect the demand for several real estate, and W. P. Carey’s portfolio is not immune to such impacts. Hence, while WPC’s third-quarter results are likely to reflect gains from its high-quality diversified portfolio and strategic investments, choppiness in certain real estate categories is likely to have been a concern.W. P. Carey’s activities during the quarter under review were not adequate to secure analysts’ confidence. The consensus estimate for the quarterly FFO per share has remained unrevised at $1.29 in a month. However, it suggests a 4.03% increase year over year.Story continuesHere Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for W. P. Carey this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an FFO beat. However, that’s not the case here.W. P. Carey currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and has an Earnings ESP of 0.00%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Performance of Notable REITsPrologis, Inc. PLD reported a third-quarter 2022 core FFO per share of $1.73, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The figure jumped a whopping 66.4% from the year-ago quarter’s $1.04. Prologis' results reflected healthy leasing activity with solid rent growth. The bottom line also improved.Alexandria Real Estate Equities, Inc. ARE reported a third-quarter 2022 adjusted FFO per share of $2.13, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by a cent. The reported figure also compared favorably with the year-ago quarter’s $1.95. Alexandria Real Estate Equities' results reflected decent leasing activity and rental rate growth during the quarter.Upcoming ReleaseHere is a stock from the REIT sector — Douglas Emmett, Inc. DEI — that you may want to consider as our model shows that this has the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.Douglas Emmett, scheduled to report third-quarter earnings on Nov 3, currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.65% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

(NYSE:RHI) Given Its Attractive Financial Prospects?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/could-market-wrong-robert-half-112719133.html,1667474839,STORY,['RHI'],"[It is hard to get excited after looking at Robert Half International's (NYSE:RHI) recent performance, when its stock has declined 3.8% over the past three months. However, a closer look at its sound financials might cause you to think again. Given that fundamentals usually drive long-term market outcomes, the company is worth looking at. In this article, we decided to focus on Robert Half International's  ROE.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. View our latest analysis for Robert Half International How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Robert Half International is:45% = US$678m ÷ US$1.5b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.45 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Robert Half International's Earnings Growth And 45% ROEFirst thing first, we like that Robert Half International has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 17% which is quite remarkable. This likely paved the way for the modest 13% net income growth seen by Robert Half International over the past five years. growthStory continuesNext, on comparing Robert Half International's net income growth with the industry, we found that the company's reported growth is similar to the industry average growth rate of 13% in the same period.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Is RHI fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Robert Half International Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?Robert Half International has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 32% (or a retention ratio of 68%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Besides, Robert Half International has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 41% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected increase in the payout ratio explains the expected decline in the company's ROE to 27%, over the same period.ConclusionIn total, we are pretty happy with Robert Half International's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. Having said that, on studying current analyst estimates, we were concerned to see that while the company has grown its earnings in the past, analysts expect its earnings to shrink in the future. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

However, investors might be overlooking a clear opportunity or potential setback if there is no rational basis for the P/E.Recent times haven't been advantageous for American Express as its earnings have been rising slower than most other companies. It might be that many expect the uninspiring earnings performance to strengthen positively, which has kept the P/E from falling. If not, then existing shareholders may be a little nervous about the viability of the share price. View our latest analysis for American Express peIf you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report on American Express.How Is American Express' Growth Trending?The only time you'd be comfortable seeing a P/E like American Express' is when the company's growth is tracking the market closely.If we review the last year of earnings growth, the company posted a worthy increase of 3.9%. EPS has also lifted 21% in aggregate from three years ago, partly thanks to the last 12 months of growth. So we can start by confirming that the company has actually done a good job of growing earnings over that time.Shifting to the future, estimates from the analysts covering the company suggest earnings should grow by 5.6% over the next year. With the market predicted to deliver 8.3% growth , the company is positioned for a weaker earnings result.In light of this, it's curious that American Express' P/E sits in line with the majority of other companies. It seems most investors are ignoring the fairly limited growth expectations and are willing to pay up for exposure to the stock. Maintaining these prices will be difficult to achieve as this level of earnings growth is likely to weigh down the shares eventually.What We Can Learn From American Express' P/E?We'd say the price-to-earnings ratio's power isn't primarily as a valuation instrument but rather to gauge current investor sentiment and future expectations.Story continuesWe've established that American Express currently trades on a higher than expected P/E since its forecast growth is lower than the wider market. Right now we are uncomfortable with the P/E as the predicted future earnings aren't likely to support a more positive sentiment for long. This places shareholders' investments at risk and potential investors in danger of paying an unnecessary premium.Before you take the next step, you should know about the 1 warning sign for American Express that we have uncovered.It's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

451,f0fc7645-da4c-3454-9489-aab238e35f7f,AXP,2022-11-03,17 Biggest Finance Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/17-biggest-finance-companies-world-150523288.html,1667401523,STORY,"['GSBD', 'SCHW', 'AXP']","[In this article, we will take a look at 17 of the biggest finance companies by market cap. If you want to see more of the biggest finance companies by market cap, go directly to 5 Biggest Finance Companies in the World.When most people think of finance companies, they think of banks. In terms of banks, there are several types of banks. Traditional community banks take deposits and make loans to individuals. Corporate banks take deposits from generally bigger corporations and make loans to bigger corporations. Lastly, capital market banks help companies and governments issue bonds and stocks in the capital market. In addition to banks, some of the world's biggest financial companies help operate payment networks that help merchants accept payments from their customers.Given their growth, many of today's biggest modern banks offer community banking, corporate banking, capital market services, and other services such as asset management.Economically ImportantFinancial companies operate at the center of modern economies.If the banks do a good job in terms of making quality loans, a country's economy can expand and growth can be faster than it would have otherwise. The banks themselves could potentially make more money in the long run.If banks don't do as good of a job in terms of making quality loans, a country's growth rate might not be as fast as it could have been. The bank's earnings might not be as high as it could be in the long run.Given their importance, many of the world's leading financial institutions are actually considered systematically important and are more regulated as a result.Leading Financial CompaniesGiven the size of the United States economy, many of the world's leading financial companies are based in the United States. With that the U.S. dollar is used as a reserve currency in many nations around the world, many of the leading U.S. financial companies have global operations too.With the growth of the Chinese economy in the past few decades, China's economy is now the second largest economy in the world. As a result, several of the leading Chinese banks rank among the world's largest financial companies. Given the Chinese government plays a much bigger role in the economy than Western governments do, Chinese banks are often run in the interest of the Chinese state rather than in the interest of shareholders at times. As a result, their financial performances may not match that of Western banks even if the economy of China is growing faster.Story continuesGiven its huge population and rapidly growing economy, one Indian bank also ranks among the most valuable financial companies in the world.2022Given the high inflation this year, the Federal Reserve has increased interest rates five times already in 2022 and many analysts think the central bank will likely raise rates even further by the end of the year.As a result of the interest rate hikes, many leading financial companies have faced headwinds.Although higher interest rates can benefit traditional community banks by making it easier for them to earn more in net interest income, too rapid of interest rate hikes or too high of interest rates can slow economic activity, which can increase write-offs and lower overall earnings. Given the decline in some bank stocks this year, it seems the market thinks that the write-offs from the potential recession next year might outweigh the positives of higher net interest income, at least in the near term.The higher interest rates have caused markets to decline in value, which hasn't been good for the asset management businesses of some banks. Lastly, the higher interest rates have caused the U.S dollar to strengthen, which isn't good in U.S. dollar terms for some international companies that do business with major financial institutions.Given the uncertainty, it can be a good idea for long term investors to own a well diversified portfolio of stocks across many different sectors.Trump International Hotel &amp; Tower, New York Citybenjamin-suter-Issa_lRkr0o-unsplashMethodologyFor our list of 17 Biggest Finance Companies in the World, we took the 17 largest companies by market capitalization from companiesmarketcap.com's Largest financial service companies by market cap list as of 10/30.17 Biggest Finance Companies in the World17.

MLM reported mixed results for third-quarter 2022. Earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but revenues marginally surpassed the same. On a year-over-year basis, the metrics improved backed by double-digit pricing growth on relatively flat organic aggregates shipments.Pertaining to fourth quarter views, Ward Nye, chairman and CEO of MLM, stated, “Importantly, we expect a return to expanding margins in the fourth quarter as the compounding effect of multiple pricing actions throughout the year offsets continued inflationary pressure and a slowdown in single-family residential construction.”Nye added, “Near-term, we expect affordability driven headwinds in the single-family residential end market will be offset by a significant acceleration in public infrastructure investment and continued strength in large-scale energy, domestic manufacturing and multi-family residential projects.”On Aug 9, the company entered into a contract to sell the Tehachapi, CA cement plant and related distribution terminals to CalPortland for $350 million in cash. The transaction is subject to customary regulatory approvals and closing conditions.Inside the HeadlinesMartin Marietta reported adjusted earnings from continuing operations of $4.69 per share, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.74 by 1.1% but increased 10.4% from the year-ago quarter’s level of $4.25 per share.Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise2 Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMartin Marietta Materials, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Martin Marietta Materials, Inc. Quote Total quarterly revenues (including Product and Services and Freight revenues) came in at $1.81 billion, up 16.3% from the year-ago period’s levels. Products and services revenues of $1.68 billion, contributing 92.8% to total revenues, increased 14.9% year over year and topped the consensus mark of $1.67 billion by 0.6%. The upside was driven by pricing gains and value-enhancing acquisitions.Story continuesSegment DiscussionBuilding Materials (including aggregates, cement, ready-mixed concrete, asphalt, paving product lines and Freight) reported revenues of $1,736 million, which increased 17.4% year over year. The upside was driven by double-digit pricing growth across all product lines and contributions from acquisitions. Within the segment, product and services revenues amounted to $1,611.5 million, up 15.9% from the year-ago quarter’s level. Freight revenues of $124.5 million were up from $88.1 million in the year-ago period.Within the Building Materials’ product and services umbrella, Aggregates revenues rose 18.5% of $1,015.7 million from the year-ago quarter’s levels. Cement revenues rose 23.4% year over year to $163.2 million. Ready Mixed Concrete’s revenues decreased 29.1% year over year to $227.4 million. Revenues in Asphalt and Paving product lines increased 58.1% from the year-ago quarter’s levels to $309.8 million.Aggregates shipments rose 5.6% year over year (down 0.1% organically) and pricing advanced 11.6% (up 11.9% organically). Acquisition benefits were offset by logistical constraints, cement shortages and inclement weather in certain key markets.Geographically, East Group shipments were flat year over year due to unfavorable weather and supply chain challenges. Pricing increased 11.5% (up 10.3% on a mix-adjusted basis). West Groups’ aggregate shipments surged 15.6% from a year ago, driven by contributions from acquired operations and strong Texas demand, partially offset by a historically wet August in North Texas. Organic pricing in the region grew 12.4% year over year (up 13.2% on a mix-adjusted basis).Cement shipments advanced 2.3% year over year. Pricing increased 21.4% year over year (up 20.6% on a mix-basis). The upside was driven by continued strong demand and multiple price increases.Within the Downstream business, ready mixed concrete shipments declined 37.6%, with pricing growth of 13.6% from the prior-year quarter. Organically, shipments were down 16.8% due to record rainfall in portions of Texas during August and the completion of certain large projects. Yet, pricing grew 20.3% due to the positive impact of multiple price increases implemented during the year.Asphalt shipments and pricing jumped 31.3% and 26.1%, respectively. On an organic basis, total asphalt shipments and pricing increased 4.3% and 22%, respectively.Magnesia Specialties reported product and services of $69 million and freight revenues of $6.7 million, down 4% year over year, due to lower demand from domestic steel industry customers for dolomitic lime products.Operating HighlightsAdjusted gross profit increased 8.4% year over year. Adjusted gross margin came in at 26.9%, which decreased from 28.9% posted a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA of $533.1 million increased 8.8% year over year.Liquidity and Cash FlowAs of Sep 30, 2022, Martin Marietta had cash and cash equivalents of $135.7 million compared with $258.4 million at the 2021-end. Also, it had nearly $1.20 billion of unused borrowing capacity on its existing credit facilities at the third quarter end. Long-term debt (excluding current maturities) was $4,339.9 million, down from $5,100.8 million at the 2021-end.Net cash provided by operations was $560.7 million for the first nine months, down from $780.3 million in the year-ago period.2022 Guidance UpdatedMartin Marietta updated its guidance for the current year, considering the first nine months’ result, ongoing inflationary pressure and lower aggregates volume. The updated guidance excludes businesses classified as discontinued operations and the gain on divestiture from the second quarter of 2022.The company expects consolidated products and services revenues in the range of $5,740-$5,845 million (compared with $5,770-$5,910 million expected earlier), gross profit in the $1,445-$1,510 million band (earlier expected in the $1,500-$1,585 million range), selling, general and administrative expenses within $390-$400 million as well as adjusted EBITDA between $1,610 million and $1,675 million (versus $1, 670-$1,750 million expected earlier).4Interest expenses are likely to be within the $165-170 million range (versus $160-165 million expected earlier) and the tax rate is projected in the range of 22-23% (versus 21-22% projected earlier). Net earnings are anticipated in the $740-$800 million range versus the earlier projection of $780-$870 million. Capital expenditures are anticipated in the $450-500 million range, lower than the earlier expectation of $525-550 million.Within the Building Materials business, total aggregate shipment growth is now expected in the range of 4-5% versus the prior projection of 5.5-8%. Organically, it is likely to be negative 1-00%, down from prior anticipation of 1-2.5%. Aggregates products and services revenues are expected in the $3,525-$3,575 million range compared with the $3,565-$3,640 million projected earlier. Total aggregate pricing per ton is expected to grow between 10% and 12%. Gross profit is likely to be in the $995-$1,035 million band.Cement, Ready Mixed Concrete and Asphalt and Paving, and Magnesia Specialties Businesses’ products and services revenues are narrowed to $610-$625 million, $1,710-$1,745 million and $285-290 million range, respectively, versus $610-$630 million, $1,705-$1,750 million and $285-295 million. Gross profit for these three businesses is likely to be in the band of $210-$220 million, $150-$160 million, and $90-$95 million, respectively.2023 Preliminary ViewThe company anticipates aggregates shipments to be effectively flat as it expects stronger demand from public infrastructure and heavy non-residential projects of scale, offset by single-family residential softening. It expects aggregates pricing growth in low-double-digit as the carryover effects from multiple actions taken this year are combined with additional price increases, beginning in January 2023.Zacks Rank &amp; Recent Construction ReleasesMartin Marietta currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.United Rentals, Inc. URI reported third-quarter 2022 results, wherein earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, but revenues missed the same. The company has been gaining from the sustained demand in its end markets and the strength of its core rental business.URI also lifted its full-year guidance for total revenues and adjusted EBITDA, given broad-based end-market activity, contractor backlogs, customer sentiment and solid visibility.Otis Worldwide Corporation OTIS reported mixed results in third-quarter 2022. Its earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate and rose on a year-over-year basis. However, sales declined from the year-ago quarter’s figure and lagged the consensus mark.For 2022, OTIS expects adjusted net sales to be within $13.4-$13.5 billion, lower than the $13.6-$13.8 billion projected earlier. Adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to be $3.11-$3.15, suggesting 5-7% year-over-year growth. This is down from the prior projection of $3.17-$3.21 per share.PulteGroup Inc. PHM reported unimpressive results in third-quarter 2022. Quarterly earnings and revenues missed their respective Zacks Consensus Estimate thanks to prevailing industry headwinds. Nonetheless, the metrics increased on a year-over-year basis.For fourth-quarter 2022, PHM expects ASP within $560,000-$570,000, indicating an increase from $490,000 registered a year ago. It expects home deliveries to be 8,000, indicating a decline from 8,611 homes delivered a year ago. The decrease reflects the challenging sales environment, higher cancelation rates and the ongoing impact of Hurricane Ian on Florida operations.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MDLZ grew more than 3% after the trading session on Nov 1, following the impressive third-quarter 2022 numbers. The top and bottom lines increased year over year and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate.Results gained from the resilience of its snacking products, brand strength, broad-based revenue growth across both emerging and developed markets, pricing actions, and robust volume growth. As a result, management raised its 2022 view.However, the company continues to witness elevated input cost inflation, particularly in energy, transportation, packaging, wheat, dairy and edible oils. In order to mitigate this, the company has already implemented price increases across key markets, including Europe. MDLZ also revealed plans to implement another round of price increases across the globe, including the United States, which is likely to be effective from December 2022.The company noted that it concluded the deal to acquire Clif Bar, which boasts a robust snack bar business worth more than 1 billion.

Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseMondelez International, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Mondelez International, Inc. QuoteQuarter in DetailAdjusted earnings were 74 cents per share, which increased 15.7% year over year on a constant-currency (cc) basis. The metric surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 68 cents per share. The year-over-year upside was backed by reduced outstanding shares, decreased taxes, solid operating gains and higher income from equity method investments. This was partly countered by the elevated interest expenses.Net revenues advanced 8.1% to $7,763 million, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7,507 million. The uptick was driven by the strong organic net revenue growth of 12.1% and increased sales from the Chipita buyout, somewhat negated by currency headwinds. Favorable volumes and pricing contributed to organic net revenues.Revenues from emerging markets increased 19.7% to $3,094 million, while rising 24.4% on an organic basis. Revenues from developed markets moved up 1.5% to $4,669 million, while increasing 5.2% on an organic basis. Region-wise, revenues in Latin America, Asia, the Middle East &amp; Africa, and North America increased 21.6%, 4.6%, and 19.6% year over year, respectively. Meanwhile, the Europe region’s revenues declined 2.4% year over year. On an organic basis, revenues increased 31.6%, 14.6%, 5.2% and 12% in the above-mentioned regions, respectively.The adjusted gross profit ascended to $351 million at cc. The adjusted gross profit margin contracted by 100 basis points (bps) to 37.4% due to increased raw material and transportation costs, and an adverse mix. These were somewhat negated by favorable pricing.Mondelez’s adjusted operating income rose $118 million at cc. The adjusted operating income margin contracted by 110 bps to 16.1% due to inflated input costs and an adverse mix, largely countered by SG&amp;A leverage and favorable pricing.Story continuesOther FinancialsThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $2,177 million, long-term debt of $19,811 million, and total equity of $26,670 million. MDLZ generated net cash from operating activities of $2,516 million in the nine months ended Sep 30, 2022. Free cash flow was $1.9 billion for the same period. Management expects a free cash flow of more than $3 billion for 2022.During the quarter, the company distributed $800 million to shareholders through cash dividends and share buybacks.GuidanceDriven by the solid quarterly results and the continued momentum in the snacks business, management raised its guidance for 2022. For 2022, management expects organic net revenues of more than 10% compared with the more than 8% growth stated earlier. The company updated the view on the sturdy year-to-date performance.It envisions a 10% increase in adjusted earnings per share or EPS at cc compared with the prior mentioned mid to high-single-digit growth.

Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum Is Occidental Petroleum Fairly Valued?We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$11.5bUS$8.49bUS$6.82bUS$6.68bUS$6.63bUS$6.64bUS$6.68bUS$6.75bUS$6.84bUS$6.95bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x4Analyst x2Analyst x2Est @ -0.74%Est @ 0.08%Est @ 0.65%Est @ 1.05%Est @ 1.33%Est @ 1.52% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 9.3% US$10.5kUS$7.1kUS$5.2kUS$4.7kUS$4.3kUS$3.9kUS$3.6kUS$3.3kUS$3.1kUS$2.9k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$49bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 9.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$6.9b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (9.3%– 2.0%) = US$97bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$97b÷ ( 1 + 9.3%)10= US$40bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$89b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$73.8, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 23% discount to where the stock price trades currently. The assumptions in any calculation have a big impact on the valuation, so it is better to view this as a rough estimate, not precise down to the last cent.dcfThe AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Occidental Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 9.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.418. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Moving On:Although the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Can we work out why the company is trading at a discount to intrinsic value? For Occidental Petroleum, there are three essential elements you should consider:Risks: Every company has them, and we've spotted   2 warning signs for Occidental Petroleum   (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about.Future Earnings: How does OXY's growth rate compare to its peers and the wider market?

This compares to earnings of $0.14 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 19.57%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this independent upstream energy company would post earnings of $0.66 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.64, delivering a surprise of -3.03%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Berry Petroleum , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Integrated - United States industry, posted revenues of $376.45 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 81.77%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $143.41 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Berry Petroleum shares have added about 7.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.1%.What's Next for Berry Petroleum?While Berry Petroleum has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Berry Petroleum: unfavorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) for the stock.

Based on an interim analysis through Week 144 of the 192-week study, people receiving TRIKAFTA showed maintained improvements in lung function, respiratory symptoms and cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) function. TRIKAFTA also continues to be generally well tolerated (Poster #170 and Oral Workshop: W21.2). These data will also be discussed during the second plenary on November 4, 2022, at NACFC.""These long-term data at 144 weeks demonstrate remarkable health effects in the longest study of TRIKAFTA. The data show sustainment of the historic improvements in lung function, respiratory symptoms and sweat chloride, a marker of CFTR function,"" said Deepika Polineni, M.D., MPH, Associate Professor of Pediatrics and Cystic Fibrosis Center Director at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and a co-investigator of the 445-105 study (Poster #170). ""CFTR modulators like TRIKAFTA have pivotally changed standard of care therapy in CF, and the CF community continues to benefit from ongoing collection and evaluation of long-term data.""Vertex will also present data for the first time from its investigational Phase 3 open-label study designed to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of TRIKAFTA in children 2 through 5 years of age with CF and at least one F508del allele (Poster #693). The study shows that treatment with TRIKAFTA led to improvements in sweat chloride concentration and lung function, as measured by the lung clearance index, and stable nutritional status in children 2 through 5 years of age. TRIKAFTA was generally well tolerated, with a safety profile generally consistent with older age groups. Based on these results, Vertex recently submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for this age range and will be filing for approvals with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) by the end of this year.Story continuesAdditionally, Vertex will present data from a pooled analysis from multiple Phase 3 studies with CFTR modulators evaluating how the restoration of CFTR-mediated chloride transport, as reflected by changes in sweat chloride concentration, impacts clinical outcomes in people with CF treated with CFTR modulators (Poster #694). The study showed that people with CF ages 12 years and older treated with CFTR modulators achieved higher levels of CFTR activity, as reflected in lower levels of sweat chloride. Those with greater improvements in sweat chloride demonstrated greater improvements in lung function, respiratory symptoms, body mass index, pulmonary exacerbations, and had better lung function trajectory over time. These new data demonstrate that higher levels of CFTR function as measured by a reduction of sweat chloride are associated with improved clinical outcomes. The best outcomes were seen in those achieving a sweat chloride concentration &lt;60 mmol/L.In addition, Vertex will present findings from the first fully decentralized study in people with CF designed to explore the feasibility of wearable technology in evaluating clinical outcomes such as cough count and physical activity (Poster #169 and Oral Workshop: W30.1).Vertex will also present interim results from Phase 3 open-label extension studies evaluating the long-term safety and efficacy of TRIKAFTA in children with CF ages 6 years and older (Poster #163 and Thematic Poster: TPS01.2) and people with CF 12 years and older with F508del-gating or F508del-residual function genotypes (Poster #185 and Thematic Poster: TPS01.5).""These new data add to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the benefits of our CFTR modulators across multiple clinical measures over the long-term, and the significant impact these medicines are having on patients,"" said Carmen Bozic, M.D., Executive Vice President, Global Medicines Development and Medical Affairs, and Chief Medical Officer, Vertex.About Cystic FibrosisCystic fibrosis (CF) is a rare, life-shortening genetic disease affecting more than 83,000 people globally. CF is a progressive, multi-organ disease that affects the lungs, liver, pancreas, GI tract, sinuses, sweat glands and reproductive tract. CF is caused by a defective and/or missing CFTR protein resulting from certain mutations in the CFTR gene. Children must inherit two defective CFTR genes — one from each parent — to have CF, and these mutations can be identified by a genetic test. While there are many different types of CFTR mutations that can cause the disease, the vast majority of people with CF have at least one F508del mutation. CFTR mutations lead to CF by causing CFTR protein to be defective or by leading to a shortage or absence of CFTR protein at the cell surface. The defective function and/or absence of CFTR protein results in poor flow of salt and water into and out of the cells in a number of organs. In the lungs, this leads to the buildup of abnormally thick, sticky mucus, chronic lung infections and progressive lung damage that eventually leads to death for many patients. The median age of death is in the early 30s.About TRIKAFTA® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor)U.S. INDICATION AND IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION FOR TRIKAFTA® (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor) TABLETSTRIKAFTA is a prescription medicine used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one copy of the F508del mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene or another mutation that is responsive to treatment with TRIKAFTA. Patients should talk to their doctor to learn if they have an indicated CF gene mutation. It is not known if TRIKAFTA is safe and effective in children under 6 years of age.Patients should not take TRIKAFTA if they take certain medicines or herbal supplements, such as: antibiotics such as rifampin or rifabutin; seizure medicines such as phenobarbital, carbamazepine, or phenytoin; St. John’s wort.Before taking TRIKAFTA, patients should tell their doctor about all of their medical conditions, including if they: have kidney problems, have or have had liver problems, are pregnant or plan to become pregnant because it is not known if TRIKAFTA will harm an unborn baby, or are breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed because it is not known if TRIKAFTA passes into breast milk.TRIKAFTA may affect the way other medicines work, and other medicines may affect how TRIKAFTA works. Therefore, the dose of TRIKAFTA may need to be adjusted when taken with certain medicines. Patients should especially tell their doctor if they take: antifungal medicines including ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, voriconazole, or fluconazole; antibiotics including telithromycin, clarithromycin, or erythromycin.TRIKAFTA may cause dizziness in some people who take it. Patients should not drive a car, operate machinery, or do anything that requires alertness until they know how TRIKAFTA affects them.Patients should avoid food or drink that contains grapefruit while they are taking TRIKAFTA.TRIKAFTA can cause serious side effects, including:Liver damage and worsening of liver function in people with severe liver disease that can be serious and may require transplantation. Liver damage has also happened in people without liver disease.High liver enzymes in the blood, which is a common side effect in people treated with TRIKAFTA. These can be serious and may be a sign of liver injury. The patient’s doctor will do blood tests to check their liver before they start TRIKAFTA, every 3 months during the first year of taking TRIKAFTA, and every year while taking TRIKAFTA. Patients should call their doctor right away if they have any of the following symptoms of liver problems: pain or discomfort in the upper right stomach (abdominal) area; yellowing of the skin or the white part of the eyes; loss of appetite; nausea or vomiting; dark, amber-colored urine.Abnormality of the eye lens (cataract) has been noted in some children and adolescents treated with TRIKAFTA. If the patient is a child or adolescent, their doctor should perform eye examinations before and during treatment with TRIKAFTA to look for cataracts.The most common side effects of TRIKAFTA include headache, diarrhea, upper respiratory tract infection (common cold) including stuffy and runny nose, stomach (abdominal) pain, inflamed sinuses, increase in liver enzymes, increase in a certain blood enzyme called creatine phosphokinase, rash, flu (influenza), and increase in blood bilirubin.These are not all the possible side effects of TRIKAFTA.Please click here to see the full U.S. Prescribing Information for TRIKAFTA (elexacaftor/tezacaftor/ivacaftor and ivacaftor).About VertexVertex is a global biotechnology company that invests in scientific innovation to create transformative medicines for people with serious diseases.

LNTH is scheduled to release third-quarter 2022 results on Nov 3, before the opening bell.In the last-reported quarter, Lantheus Holdings’ earnings of 89 cents per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 27.1%. Over the trailing four quarters, its earnings outperformed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on all occasions, the average being 54.6%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to this announcement.Factors at PlayDuring the second-quarter 2022 earnings call in August, Lantheus Holdings’ management confirmed that it has been registering a robust uptick in sales of its PYLARIFY, an F 18-labeled PET imaging agent targeting prostate-specific membrane antigen. The favorable adoption of PYLARIFY is expected to have continued in the third quarter on the back of its positive impact of the PSMA-targeted PET imaging on the U.S. prostate cancer community. This is likely to have considerably driven the to-be-reported quarter’s revenues.During the same call, Lantheus Holdings’ management confirmed that in the European Union, Curium completed its Phase III PYTHON clinical trial for piflufolastat F-18 in May and submitted its marketing authorization application to the European Medicines Agency in June. The company has also worked with Curium to add PYLARIFY to its U.S. ECLIPSE trial. PYLARIFY will be used to determine PSMA avidity as part of patient selection and will now be included in the vast majority of late-stage U.S. trials for the study of PSMA-targeted therapies. These developments buoy our optimism about the stock.Lantheus Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseLantheus Holdings, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseLantheus Holdings, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Lantheus Holdings, Inc. QuoteLantheus Holdings’ ultrasound-enhancing agent, DEFINITY, has been registering strong growth over the past few months, despite headwinds resulting from a decrease in referring physician visits and staffing-related challenges (consistent with the trends noted by other companies in the healthcare sector). Management’s belief that contrast-enhanced echocardiography continues to play an important role in cardiac imaging raises our optimism regarding DEFINITY’s sales in the third quarter.Story continuesOver the past few months, Lantheus Holdings has announced positive results from a slew of studies regarding its products. The company is on track to expand its portfolio, evaluate several opportunities to collaborate, and in-license or acquire additional assets. Lantheus Holdings is particularly focused on late-stage diagnostic and therapeutic product opportunities in oncology that complement its existing portfolio. Apart from these, certain early-stage opportunities also align with the strategy that drives its pharma services business. Lantheus Holdings’ recent collaboration agreement with Radiopharm Theranostics is one such example. These raise our optimism about the stock.The Estimate PictureFor third-quarter 2022, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $228.5 million for total revenues calls for a surge of 123.9% from the prior-year reported figure.The consensus estimate for adjusted earnings per share is pegged at 83 cents, indicating a stupendous improvement of 937.5% from the prior-year reported number.What Our Model SuggestsOur proven model predicts an earnings beat for Lantheus Holdings this time around.

472,bfb623ef-b84a-36ad-9e0a-66a79d294a4c,TXT,2022-11-03,Is There An Opportunity With Textron Inc.'s (NYSE:TXT) 28% Undervaluation?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/opportunity-textron-inc-nyse-txt-183435063.html,1667414075,STORY,['TXT'],"[How far off is Textron Inc. (NYSE:TXT) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Before you think you won't be able to understand it, just read on! It's actually much less complex than you'd imagine.We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Textron What's The Estimated Valuation?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$985.0mUS$975.2mUS$1.04bUS$1.02bUS$1.01bUS$1.02bUS$1.02bUS$1.04bUS$1.05bUS$1.07bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x6Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ -0.53%Est @ 0.22%Est @ 0.75%Est @ 1.12%Est @ 1.38%Est @ 1.56% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 6.6% US$924US$858US$857US$790US$738US$694US$656US$622US$592US$564(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$7.3bStory continuesWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.0%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 6.6%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$1.1b× (1 + 2.0%) ÷ (6.6%– 2.0%) = US$24bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$24b÷ ( 1 + 6.6%)10= US$12bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$20b. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$68.5, the company appears a touch undervalued at a 28% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Textron as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.6%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.897. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price? For Textron, we've compiled three important items you should assess:Financial Health: Does TXT have a healthy balance sheet?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out George Soros Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Large-Cap Stock Picks. George Soros, a Hungarian-American businessman, founded Soros Fund Management in 1970. Soros Fund Management is a New York-based hedge fund which carved its place as one of the most profitable funds on Wall Street, however, it is now structured as a family office. The George Soros stock portfolio is worth $5.6 billion as of the second quarter of 2022, and the billionaire makes highly leveraged investments keeping in mind the currency movements and commodity prices, as well as fundamental macroeconomic and market analysis. The condition of the housing market also plays an important role in his investment decisions. Soros tends to invest in large-cap, small-cap, exchange traded funds, and both growth and value plays. Large-cap stocks are usually perceived as less risky. These tend to be companies that are very stable and dominate their respective sectors, with market capitalization ranging from $10 billion to $200 billion. These prominent firms have fortress balance sheets and the ability to withstand market volatility. Large-cap companies also usually return a percentage of their profits to shareholders as dividends, which helps investors navigate a downturn in the economy relatively better. Some of the best large-cap stocks in the George Soros stock portfolio are Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU). Our Methodology We selected the top large-cap stock picks from George Soros’ stock portfolio as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 for this analysis. Insider Monkey’s database of 895 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the second quarter of 2022 was used to assess the hedge fund sentiment around the securities. George Soros Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Large-Cap Stock PicksGeorge Soros Stock Portfolio: Top Large-Cap Stock Picks10. Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 27Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) is a Colorado-based communications company that provides a range of wireless, data, video, voice, and managed services to residential customers, businesses, government entities, and educational and medical institutions. In Q2 2022, the George Soros stock portfolio had 1.75 million shares of Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA), worth $202.35 million and representing 3.6% of the total 13F securities. Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) has been part of the Soros portfolio since the second quarter of 2016. Story continuesOn May 10, Deutsche Bank analyst Bryan Kraft maintained a Buy recommendation on Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) but lowered the firm's price target on the shares to $158 from $196.According to Insider Monkey’s second quarter database, Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) was part of 27 public stock portfolios, compared to 26 in the prior quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management held the leading position in the company, comprising 8.30 million shares worth $960.2 million. Like Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Intuit Inc. (NASDAQ:INTU), Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) is one of the top large-cap picks from the George Soros stock portfolio. Alphyn Capital made the following comment about Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“In retrospect, I wish I had cut the position in Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) more aggressively last quarter. Fears of fixed wireless and fiber competition have weighed heavily on Charter and Liberty’s share prices. Tom Rutledge’s unexpected early retirement from the CEO role has not helped matters.I believe the sentiment is now overly pessimistic, and the valuation once again attractive. Revenue growth from broadband ads will likely stall as fixed wireless access programs take a bite out of cable subscribers over the next five years. 4 However, Charter has a fast-growing mobile phone business through an MVNO (mobile virtual network operator) agreement with Verizon. Given its cost-effective access to Verizon’s mobile telephony infrastructure, it provides a branded mobile phone service to retail customers at competitive rates. For example, Unlimited pricing starts at $29.99/month, including taxes and fees, vs. $35-55/month plus taxes and fees for Verizon’s plans.Wireless generates approximately $725m in revenues for Charter per quarter, around 6% of the total, and is growing 40% per year. Should this continue, Wireless could return Charter to mid-single-digit revenue growth and “drive meaningful EBITDA for Charter,” as revenues scale over a low cost base. With approximately 25m non-Charter potential wireless customers within the area it serves, there is plenty of room for growth.”9. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a California-based company that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells electric vehicles and related accessories. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) is the largest holding in the George Soros stock portfolio, with 17.8 million shares worth $459 million, representing 8.17% of the total securities. Soros Fund Management added Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) to its portfolio in the last quarter of 2021. On October 11, after a conversation with the management, Mizuho analyst Vijay Rakesh said that Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN)’s vehicle recall is ""relatively minor"" and that its manufacturing lines have already been updated. He believes Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) has seen the issue on ""less than 1%"" of vehicles and the company forecasts the cost of fixing the recall to be ""minimal"". The analyst noted that the headlines are ""worse than reality"" and maintained a Buy rating on the shares with a $65 price target.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 35 funds reported owning stakes worth $1.6 billion in Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) at the end of Q2 2022, compared to 29 funds in the prior quarter worth $4 billion. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is the biggest position holder in the company, with 18.8 million shares worth $486 million. Here is what Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund has to say about Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:RIVN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Rivian Automotive, Inc. designs, manufactures, and sells consumer and commercial electric vehicles. Shares of Rivian declined 48.2% in the second quarter as investors continued rotating out of long-duration assets and have become increasingly concerned about capital intensity and cash burn.At the same time, Rivian continues to be impacted by supply chain issues which are causing delays in its production ramp. Rivian is addressing those challenges by diversifying its supply chain to alleviate shortages while also consolidating the number of variants in development to reduce cash burn (the company guided that current cash will be enough to support the company’s future platform launch ‘R2’ in 2025). Rivian recently reported stronger-than-expected second quarter production numbers while reiterating its annual guidance of producing 25,000 units.As semiconductor shortages ease, we believe that the company will be able to rapidly ramp its production. We retain conviction in the shares given management’s vision, Rivian’s product positioning, the company’s relationship with Amazon.com, and its strong balance sheet. As of the end of the first quarter, Rivian had $17 billion of cash and cash equivalents, which will help it overcome the current challenges while taking advantage of the long-term opportunity as the market transitions to electric vehicles.”8. Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) was founded in 2011 and is based in Dublin, Ireland. The company manufactures and sells electrical, electronic, and safety technology solutions to the automotive and commercial vehicle markets worldwide. In the second quarter of 2022, the George Soros stock portfolio lifted its Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) stake by 1%, holding 246,055 shares worth nearly $22 million. The stock has been part of the Soros portfolio since Q2 2020. On September 28, Berenberg analyst Jared Maymon assumed coverage of Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) with a Buy rating and a $130 price target. The analyst noted that content per vehicle is increasing and Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is gaining share. He believes Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) is well positioned to capture a significant share of an expanded total addressable market in the long term.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 43 hedge funds were long Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) at the end of June 2022, compared to 48 funds in the earlier quarter. Ian Simm’s Impax Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.6 million shares worth $417 million. Here is what ClearBridge Investments Sustainability Leaders Strategy has to say about Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“The acceleration in electrification of transport should support electric vehicle (EV)-related stocks like Aptiv (NYSE:APTV), which came under pressure in the quarter on concerns the auto cycle is past its peak. Aptiv provides a range of solutions for the auto industry, including autonomous driving technologies, safety technologies, components, and wiring. The large exposure of APTV to EVs should lead to long-term value as EVs continue their growth, boosted by their relative attractiveness as prices at the pump hit near-historic highs.”7. D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 44D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is a Texas-based homebuilding company that constructs and sells residential homes under the D.R. Horton, America's Builder, Express Homes, Emerald Homes, and Freedom Homes brands. In Q2 2022, the George Soros stock portfolio featured nearly 3 million shares of D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI), worth $197 million and representing 3.5% of the total holdings. Raymond James analyst Buck Horne on October 21 downgraded D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) to Outperform from Strong Buy with a price target of $77, down from $103. The downgrade factors in the analyst’s more concerned outlook on the housing market as mortgage rates have driven affordability to uncharted highs. However, he remains constructive on D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) in this environment as the sector’s most cost-efficient producer of single-family housing.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) was part of 44 public stock portfolios at the end of June 2022, compared to 52 in the last quarter. John Armitage’s Egerton Capital Limited is the leading position holder in the company, with 7.6 million shares worth $504 million. Here is what Third Avenue Management specifically said about D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“D.R. Horton, Inc. (NYSE:DHI) is the largest homebuilder in the US by volume (the company sold more than 90k homes in the past year) with a well-recognized focus on delivering quality product at the entry-level price point (its average selling price is less than $400k) and market-leading positions in key Sunbelt markets.While the near-term outlook for DR Horton remains uncertain given the adjustments occurring in the US residential markets, the medium-to-long-term prospects for volume-based homebuilders with super-strong balance sheets and scale advantages continue to be promising in Fund Management’s view. More specifically, (i) residential inventories remain around record-low levels in most major markets when gauged by aggregate units available (see chart below), (ii) demand for single-family residences seem to have multiple secular drivers as the largest generation in US history (the “millennial cohort”) enters its prime home buying years and desires more space not only due to “life events” but also “remote” and “hybrid” working arrangements, and (iii) significant inflation in rental rates for multi-family units in urban areas has left the rent-to-own proposition for single-family homes in suburban areas in a compelling range (particularly in the Sunbelt region which is experiencing outsized job growth and wage growth relative to broader national figures).In Fund Management’s view, the two industry participants that seem most likely to take part in this shift include DR Horton and Lennar Corp. (a long-held position in the Fund). In conjunction, these two “blue-chip builders” now account for approximately 10% of the Fund’s capital, as well as roughly one out of every five new homes built in the Sunbelt. They would also qualify under Third Avenue Founder Marty Whitman’s “Safe and Cheap” maxim as both companies are nearly “net-cash” (i.e., more cash than debt) with common stocks trading at less than five times trailing earnings, on average.”6.

This company, which is in the Zacks Computer - Software industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This maker of TurboTax, QuickBooks and other accounting software has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 6.45%.For the most recent quarter, Intuit was expected to post earnings of $0.98 per share, but it reported $1.10 per share instead, representing a surprise of 12.24%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $7.60 per share, while it actually produced $7.65 per share, a surprise of 0.66%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Intuit, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Intuit has an Earnings ESP of +0.09% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on November 29, 2022.Story continuesWith the Earnings ESP metric, it's important to note that a negative value reduces its predictive power; however, a negative Earnings ESP does not indicate an earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.33 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates three times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Ingersoll shares have lost about 18.7% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.1%.What's Next for Ingersoll?While Ingersoll has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Ingersoll: mixed.

For more information, visit www.IRCO.com.Non-U.S. GAAP Measures of Financial PerformanceIn addition to consolidated GAAP financial measures, Ingersoll Rand reviews various non-GAAP financial measures, including ""Organic Revenue Growth,"" ""Adjusted EBITDA,"" ""Adjusted Net Income,"" ""Adjusted Diluted EPS"" and ""Free Cash Flow.""Ingersoll Rand believes Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, and Adjusted Diluted EPS are helpful supplemental measures to assist management and investors in evaluating the Company’s operating results as they exclude certain items that are unusual in nature or whose fluctuation from period to period do not necessarily correspond to changes in the operations of Ingersoll Rand’s business. Ingersoll Rand believes Organic Revenue Growth is a helpful supplemental measure to assist management and investors in evaluating the Company’s operating results as it excludes the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions on revenue growth. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and certain non-cash, non-recurring and other adjustment items. Adjusted Net Income is defined as net income including interest, depreciation and amortization of non-acquisition related intangible assets and excluding other items used to calculate Adjusted EBITDA and further adjusted for the tax effect of these exclusions. Organic Revenue Growth is defined as As Reported Revenue growth less the impacts of Foreign Currency and Acquisitions. Ingersoll Rand believes that the adjustments applied in presenting Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income are appropriate to provide additional information to investors about certain material non-cash items and about non-recurring items that the Company does not expect to continue at the same level in the future. Adjusted Diluted EPS is defined as Adjusted Net Income divided by Adjusted Diluted Average Shares Outstanding. Incrementals/Decrementals are defined as the change in Adjusted EBITDA versus the prior year period divided by the change in revenue versus the prior year period.Ingersoll Rand uses Free Cash Flow to review the liquidity of its operations. Ingersoll Rand measures Free Cash Flow as cash flows from operating activities less capital expenditures. Ingersoll Rand believes Free Cash Flow is a useful supplemental financial measures for management and investors in assessing the Company’s ability to pursue business opportunities and investments and to service its debt. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of our liquidity under GAAP and should not be considered as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities.Management and Ingersoll Rand’s board of directors regularly use these measures as tools in evaluating the Company’s operating and financial performance and in establishing discretionary annual compensation. Such measures are provided in addition to, and should not be considered to be a substitute for, or superior to, the comparable measures under GAAP. In addition, Ingersoll Rand believes that Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, Incrementals/Decrementals and Free Cash Flow are frequently used by investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers, many of which also present Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS, and Free Cash Flow when reporting their results in an effort to facilitate an understanding of their operating and financial results and liquidity.Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow should not be considered as alternatives to revenue growth, net income, diluted earnings per share or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, or as alternatives to cash flow from operating activities as a measure of our liquidity. Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow have limitations as analytical tools, and you should not consider such measures either in isolation or as substitutes for analyzing Ingersoll Rand’s results as reported under GAAP.Reconciliations of Organic Revenue Growth, Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Net Income, Adjusted Diluted EPS and Free Cash Flow to their most comparable U.S. GAAP financial metrics for historical periods are presented in the tables below.Reconciliations of non-GAAP measures related to full-year 2022 guidance have not been provided due to the unreasonable efforts it would take to provide such reconciliations due to the high variability, complexity and uncertainty with respect to forecasting and quantifying certain amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations, including net income (loss) and adjustments that could be made for acquisitions-related expenses, restructuring and other business transformation costs, gains or losses on foreign currency exchange and the timing and magnitude of other amounts in the reconciliation of historic numbers. For the same reasons, we are unable to address the probable significance of the unavailable information, which could have a potentially unpredictable, and potentially significant, impact on our future GAAP financial results.INGERSOLL RAND INC.

486,ebe94d67-ef52-3713-9374-9ad64d8eb30d,SRE,2022-11-03,ONCOR REPORTS THIRD QUARTER 2022 RESULTS,PR Newswire,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oncor-reports-third-quarter-2022-110500416.html,1667473500,STORY,['SRE'],"[Service Territory GrowthOperational HighlightsCapital Expenditure Plans UpdateBase Rate Review UpdateLiquidity UpdateDALLAS, Nov. 3, 2022 /PRNewswire/ -- Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC (""Oncor"") today reported three months ended September 30, 2022 net income of $318 million compared to net income of $258 million in the three months ended September 30, 2021. Oncor's quarter-over-quarter net income improvement was driven by increases in revenues from higher customer consumption attributable primarily to significantly warmer weather in the third quarter of 2022 as compared to the third quarter of 2021, updates to base transmission and distribution rates to reflect increases in invested capital, an annual energy efficiency program performance bonus approved in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the prior year's annual energy efficiency program performance bonus being approved in the fourth quarter of 2021, and customer growth, partially offset by increases in costs associated with additional investments (primarily depreciation, property taxes and borrowing costs) and higher operation and maintenance expense.Oncor. (PRNewsFoto/Oncor)""The Oncor team turned in yet another strong financial and operational quarter, focused on meeting the needs of our customers,"" said Oncor CEO Allen Nye. ""We're in a very unique time at Oncor. The Oncor service territory, and the entire state of Texas more broadly, is experiencing tremendous – and in many places record – levels of growth. This growth continues despite ongoing supply chain impacts on builders, higher interest rates, and signals of a national recession. The employees and contractors of Oncor continue to work safely and efficiently to meet the needs of our customers and the ERCOT market. Our work has also included lending a hand to utilities outside of ERCOT after major outages. Recently, Oncor sent more than 500 mutual assistance personnel to Florida to help with power restoration efforts in the wake of Hurricane Ian. I'm so proud of our team and all they do to help power the state of Texas and beyond.""Story continuesOncor's reported net income of $741 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 compared favorably to net income of $595 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2021. Oncor's period-over-period net income improvement was driven by increases in revenues from updates to base transmission and distribution rates to reflect increases in invested capital, higher customer consumption attributable primarily to significantly warmer weather as compared to the same period in 2021, an annual energy efficiency program performance bonus approved in the third quarter of 2022 compared to the prior year's annual energy efficiency program performance bonus being approved in the fourth quarter of 2021, and customer growth, partially offset by increases in costs associated with additional investment (primarily depreciation, property taxes and borrowing costs) and higher operation and maintenance expense.Oncor's total distribution base revenues in the three months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 increased 9.2% (2.3% increase on a weather normalized basis). The change in Oncor's total distribution base revenues in the third quarter of 2022 included a 12.6% increase in distribution base revenues from residential customers (0.7% increase on a weather normalized basis) and a 5.6% increase in distribution base revenues from large commercial and industrial customers. Oncor's total distribution base revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2021 increased 10.5% (5.4% increase on a weather normalized basis). The change in Oncor's total distribution base revenues in the nine months ended September 30, 2022 included a 14.4% increase in distribution base revenues from residential customers (4.5% increase on a weather normalized basis) and a 7.3% increase in distribution base revenues from large commercial and industrial customers. Financial and operational results are provided in Tables A, B, C and D below.Oncor Service Territory Growth Oncor's service territory continues to be one of the fastest growing areas of the country, and Oncor continues to support that growth with new projects, including projects designed to increase reliability for the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (""ERCOT"") market.  Oncor connected approximately 14,000 new premises to the ERCOT grid in the third quarter of 2022, as compared to approximately 13,000 in the third quarter of 2021.At September 30, 2022, Oncor had approximately 565 active transmission point-of-interconnection (""POI"") requests in queue, representing an approximately 52% increase in active POI requests compared to September 30, 2021. Of the active generation requests in queue, approximately 52% are solar, 35% are storage, 10% are wind and 3% are gas. Through the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Oncor had approximately 230 new POI requests as compared to approximately 160 new POI requests during the same period of 2021. If new requests continue at this pace for the rest of the year, Oncor anticipates it will set a company record for new annual transmission interconnection requests in 2022.The continued growth across Oncor's service territory required the construction or upgrading of approximately 300 miles of power lines and included two major substation projects being placed in service in the third quarter of 2022. While the third quarter is generally considered a lighter in-service quarter for transmission projects due to ERCOT summer clearance constraints, Oncor placed $80 million of transmission projects into service in the third quarter of 2022. Also, Oncor expects a significant number of projects to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2022.Operational HighlightsDuring the third quarter of 2022, Texas continued to experience significantly higher than normal temperatures. ERCOT's record peak demand set in June, was broken several times in July reaching a new all-time record peak demand of over 80,000 megawatts on July 20, 2022. Throughout the heat wave experienced in the second and third quarters of 2022, Oncor's system performed well and Oncor remains on pace to meet its reliability goals for 2022.In September, Oncor answered the call of mutual assistance partners and deployed more than 500 employees and contractors to Florida as mutual assistance support to Florida utilities, prepositioning personnel and other resources to help restore power in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian.In early October, an independent third party ESG ratings company improved its rating of Oncor, ranking Oncor in the top 3 percent of electric utilities rated by that agency.Oncor's commitment to Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion continues to expand. In September 2022, Oncor rolled out an ""I Belong"" initiative to encourage employees to verify, or update as needed, their demographics. The goal of the initiative is to enable Oncor to enhance its culture and create new initiatives to help ensure that it is supporting all employees.Capital Expenditure PlansIn the nine months ended September 30, 2022, Oncor's capital expenditures totaled $2.2 billion and Oncor is on track to meet its $3.0 billion capital plan for 2022. Oncor has and expects to continue to review future capital expenditure plans with its board of directors. However, given the number of uncertainties at this stage in the capital expenditure planning process, particularly continued record growth in Texas, high inflation and a pending rate case, Oncor management recommended that its board of directors delay approval of a 2023 capital expenditure budget until a future board meeting. As a result, Oncor will not be updating its future capital plans at this time, but expects to announce a new five-year capital plan by the end of the first quarter of 2023.Base Rate Review Oncor's base rate case before the Public Utility Commission of Texas (""PUCT"") continues to progress. The rate review includes a request for an average annual revenue requirement increase over current adjusted rates of 4.5%, and, if approved as requested, would result in an aggregate annual revenue requirement increase of approximately $251 million. The rate review also requests a revised regulatory capital structure ratio of 55% debt to 45% equity and an authorized return on equity of 10.3%. Oncor's current authorized regulatory capital structure ratio is 57.5% debt to 42.5% equity and its current authorized return on equity is 9.8%. A hearing on the merits was held before the State Office of Administrative Hearings from September 26, 2022 to October 4, 2022, and a proposal for decision is expected from the administrative law judges to the PUCT for its consideration by December 27, 2022. Resolution of the rate review requires issuance of a final order by the PUCT, which is expected by the end of the first quarter of 2023, and new rates would go into effect following issuance of that order.LiquidityAs of November 3, 2022, Oncor's available liquidity, consisting of cash on hand and available credit facility and commercial paper program capacity, totaled approximately $2.2 billion. Oncor expects cash flows from operations combined with long-term debt issuances and term loan credit agreements as well as availability under its credit facility and commercial paper program to be sufficient to fund current obligations, projected working capital requirements, maturities of long-term debt and capital expenditures for at least the next 12 months.Sempra Internet Broadcast TodaySempra (NYSE: SRE) (BMV: SRE) will broadcast a live discussion of its earnings results over the Internet today at 12 p.m. ET, which will include discussion of third quarter 2022 results and other information relating to Oncor.

(SDG&amp;E) and Southern California Gas Co. (SoCalGas) continue to advance key regulatory filings to support the companies' investments, which align with California's clean energy goals and focus on safety, reliability and decarbonizing the economy. Both companies are awaiting a final decision by year-end from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) on their updated cost of capital applications for 2023 through 2025, which were filed earlier this year. Specific to SDG&amp;E's 2022 off-cycle cost of capital application, a proposed decision and an alternate proposed decision were issued on September 30, and the CPUC is scheduled to approve a decision today.Additionally, both SDG&amp;E and SoCalGas are continuing to pursue a series of opportunities to advance clean energy and new technologies in California. In September, the companies filed a joint CPUC application with Southwest Gas to conduct hydrogen blending demonstration projects in collaboration with the Universities of California at Irvine and San Diego to enhance grid resiliency and help the state reach its goal of carbon neutrality by 2045. The projects build upon years of research to scale hydrogen blending to help drive decarbonization across multiple sectors of the economy.Other projects either proposed or under development by SDG&amp;E or SoCalGas in pursuit of sustainable technologies include opportunities to supply renewable natural gas to customers, deploy microgrids and develop energy storage at strategic locations and substations in their service areas. Also, SoCalGas is advancing decarbonization of the Los Angeles region through Angeles Link, its proposed green hydrogen energy network.Sempra Texas In Texas, Oncor has invested $2.2 billion of its $3 billion 2022 capital plan to support strong economic growth and improved system reliability and expansion in its service territory.During the quarter, Oncor connected approximately 14,000 new premises, bringing its year-to-date new premise count to approximately 49,000. Additionally, Oncor remains on pace to set a company record for new annual transmission interconnection requests in 2022, with 65 new transmission point-of-interconnection requests received in the third quarter. Of the 565 active generation requests in queue, approximately 52% are solar, 35% are storage, and 10% are wind, highlighting the company's continued efforts to facilitate the growing integration of renewables in its service area. Across its territory, Oncor placed $80 million of transmission projects into service in the third quarter. These included placement of two major substation projects into service and a portion of the construction or upgrade of approximately 300 miles of transmission and distribution lines.Oncor is progressing its base rate review with the Public Utility Commission of Texas and expects final resolution of the case by the end of the first quarter of 2023.Sempra InfrastructureSempra Infrastructure is focused on clean power, energy networks, liquefied natural gas (LNG) and net-zero investments to support the deployment of energy solutions critical to advancing global climate goals, while meeting the concurrent need for secure, abundant and reliable energy.

An improvement in economic conditions after the pandemic has been generating fresh demand for utility services.Per the latest Earnings Preview, the Zacks Utilities sector’s third-quarter 2022 earnings are expected to decline 9.3% while revenues are estimated to improve 3%. The capital-intensive utility stocks were impacted by the ongoing increase in interest rates and rising operating costs, while new rates implemented in their service territories boosted revenues.Factors to ConsiderDomestic-focused companies operating in the sector are focused on cost management and implementation of energy-efficiency programs. New rates and customer additions are creating fresh demand as well as assisting the utilities. Investment in strengthening the infrastructure is allowing the utilities to provide services even during extreme conditions, leading to stable earnings. Domestic-focused operations also insulate utilities from the adverse impact of currency fluctuation.Per the updated outlook of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the July-September 2022 average contiguous U.S. temperature was 73.0°F, 2.8°F above average. The above-average temperature during the summer months is likely to have spurred demand for water and electricity for cooling purposes, benefiting the utilities.A clear transition is evident in the Utilities space, with companies operating in this space gradually moving toward clean sources of fuel to produce electricity and lower emission. The stringent regulation of emissions, the high cost of conventional fuel and government incentives on the usage of clean fuel are also urging the utilities to focus more on clean energy sources. Many utilities have already pledged to provide 100% electricity from clean sources in the next few decades.Utilities need massive funds to upgrade, maintain and expand their infrastructure and operations, and are capital-intensive in nature. The performance of the utilities is likely to have been adversely impacted by the increase in interest rates from near-zero levels. The increase in borrowing costs and the possibility of more interest rate hikes this year may have further pushed up capital servicing expenses and adversely impacted earnings.According to the Zacks model, a company needs the right combination of two key ingredients — a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better — to increase the odds of an earnings surprise.

However, higher diesel fuel costs and inflationary pressures for many other parts and supplies weighed on the bottom line.Looking ahead, chairman and CEO Tom Hill said, “As we look ahead to 2023, leading indicators suggest that growing public construction activity, particularly highways, and the recovery in private nonresidential contract awards should help to offset contracting single-family residential demand. The pricing environment remains positive, and we carry strong momentum into 2023.”Vulcan Materials Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseVulcan Materials Company Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseVulcan Materials Company price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Vulcan Materials Company QuoteInside the HeadlinesAdjusted earnings of $1.78 per share beat the consensus mark of $1.71.

This upside was led by double-digit growth in the company's legacy operations as well as the addition of acquired businesses.Segments in DetailAggregatesRevenues from the segment increased 27.1% year over year to $1,490.5 million, owing to higher demand across all end-market segments. Aggregate shipments (volumes) increased 9% year over year (up 3% on a same-store basis).

Freight-adjusted revenues also rose 22.2% from the prior-year quarter to $1,097.2 million.Gross profit of $436.1 million was up 17.1% year over year, backed by price growth and solid operational execution, offsetting cost headwinds that include higher diesel fuel costs and inflationary pressures for many other parts and supplies.Asphalt, Concrete and CalciumRevenues from the Asphalt segment were $310.2 million, up 40.6% year over year. The segment generated a gross profit of $29.5 million compared with $7.1 million a year ago. Volumes grew 13%, driven by growth in Arizona and California, the company's largest two asphalt markets. Asphalt pricing was up 26%.

Further, gross profit totaled $26.5 million, up from $14.3 million a year ago.

This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.52 billion.

This is encouraging because it indicates that insiders are more optimistic about the company's prospects.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for General Electric General Electric Insider Transactions Over The Last YearIn the last twelve months, the biggest single purchase by an insider was when Chairman &amp; CEO H. Culp bought US$4.8m worth of shares at a price of US$75.26 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to buy, at around the current price, which is US$77.40. While their view may have changed since the purchase was made, this does at least suggest they have had confidence in the company's future. While we always like to see insider buying, it's less meaningful if the purchases were made at much lower prices, as the opportunity they saw may have passed. Happily, the General Electric insiders decided to buy shares at close to current prices.In the last twelve months insiders purchased 75.54k shares for US$5.7m. On the other hand they divested 1.44k shares, for US$107k. Overall, General Electric insiders were net buyers during the last year.

You probably do not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Does General Electric Boast High Insider Ownership?I like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. General Electric insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$207m based on the recent share price. I like to see this level of insider ownership, because it increases the chances that management are thinking about the best interests of shareholders.Story continuesSo What Do The General Electric Insider Transactions Indicate?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much.

This new indication is in addition to its use with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging to visualize dopamine transporters (DaT) in the brains of adult patients with suspected Parkinsonian syndromes. With the expanded indication, DaTscan is now available to more patients, including those with suspected DLB, in the United States.The clinical signs and symptoms of DLB can be atypical and overlap with other forms of dementia, leading to up to 70% of patients with DLB being misdiagnosed, often as having Alzheimer’s Diseaseii. This new indication enables clinicians to use DaTscan to help differentiate DLB from other forms of dementia. Early and accurate diagnosis of DLB can help ensure specific appropriate treatment and specialized care for patients, while enabling them and their caregivers to more effectively manage the disease and plan for the futureiii.Approximately one in five patients with dementia suffers from DLB, making it the second most common form of degenerative dementia after Alzheimer’s Diseasei.Professor James E. Galvin, MD, MPH, Consultant, University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, U.S., said: ""Misdiagnosis is a significant issue for those patients with suspected Dementia with Lewy Bodies, causing untold anxiety for the patient and family as well as potentially placing the patient at higher risk of adverse events due to delayed diagnosis. The label expansion for DaTscan moves patients a step closer to an earlier, more accurate, diagnosis which is beneficial for them and their families, setting them on the right treatment path sooner and helping to avoid medications and treatments that could be potentially harmful.""Story continuesMark Hibberd, Chief Medical Officer for GE Healthcare Pharmaceutical Diagnostics, said: ""More than one million doses of DaTscan have already been used around the world in the clinical evaluation of Parkinsonian syndromes. We have built on our scientific and medical leadership with DaTscan to pave the path for this new indication, that supports our customers and their patients with more accurate diagnoses of DLB.""The approval of the use of DaTscan in DLB is the culmination of significant work, including clinical trials, compilation and analysis of data and collating evidence for submission to the U.S. FDA, all demonstrating GE Healthcare’s continued commitment and investment in this space.Earlier this year, GE Healthcare announced plans to bolster its Molecular Imaging neurology portfolio by complementing DaTscan with two pipeline radiopharmaceuticals, one for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) and another for SPECT, aiming to offer customers, in both clinical and research settings, a wider choice of diagnostic tracers to help evaluate adult patients with suspected Parkinsonian syndromes.GE Healthcare’s Pharmaceutical Diagnostics unit is a global leader in imaging agents used to support around 100 million procedures per year globally, equivalent to three patient procedures every second. Its Molecular Imaging portfolio combines established proprietary products across cardiology, neurology and oncology, with an innovative pipeline, all aimed at enabling better diagnosis and monitoring for improved therapy decision-making and clinical outcomes.References:i Barker, Warren W et al.

Thyroid uptake of iodine-123 may result in an increased long-term risk for thyroid neoplasia. To decrease thyroid accumulation of iodine-123, block the thyroid gland before administration of DaTscan.ADVERSE REACTIONSIn clinical trials, headache, nausea, vertigo, dry mouth, or dizziness of mild to moderate severity were reported. In postmarketing experience, hypersensitivity reactions and injection-site pain have been reportedDRUG INTERACTIONSDrugs that bind to the dopamine transporter with high affinity may interfere with the DaTscan image. The impact of dopamine agonists and antagonists on DaTscan imaging results has not been establishedUSE IN SPECIFIC POPULATIONSPregnancy: Radioactive iodine products cross the placenta and can permanently impair fetal thyroid function. Administration of a thyroid blocking agent is recommended before the use of DaTscan in a pregnant woman. All radiopharmaceuticals have potential to cause fetal harm. There are no available data on DaTscan use in pregnant women to evaluate for a drug- associated risk of major birth defects, miscarriage or adverse maternal or fetal outcomes. Advise pregnant woman of the potential risks of fetal exposure to radiation with the administration of DaTscanLactation: Iodine 123 (I 123), the radionuclide in DaTscan, is present in human milk. There is no information on the effects on breastfed infants or on milk. Advise a lactating woman to interrupt breastfeeding and pump and discard breast milk for at least 6 days after DaTscan administration to minimize radiation exposure to a breastfeeding infantPediatric Use: The safety and efficacy of DaTscan have not been established in pediatric patientsGeriatric Use: There were no differences in responses between elderly patients and younger patients that would require a dose adjustment observed in the parkinsonian syndrome studies.Renal Impairment: DaTscan is excreted by the kidney and patients with severe renal impairment may have increased radiation exposure and altered DaTscan imagesOVERDOSAGEThe risks of overdose relate predominantly to increased radiation exposure, with the long-term risks for neoplasia. In case of overdosage of radioactivity, frequent urination and defecation should be encouraged to minimize radiation exposure to the patient.PROCEDURE — Radiation SafetyDaTscan emits radiation and must be handled with safety measures to minimize radiation exposure to clinical personnel and patientsPrior to DaTscan administration, please read the full Prescribing Information for additional Important Safety Information.To report SUSPECTED ADVERSE REACTIONS, contact GE Healthcare at 800 654 0118 (option 2, then option 1) or the FDA at 800 FDA 1088 or www.fda.gov/medwatch.About DaTscanDaTscan is a radiopharmaceutical imaging agent that works by binding to dopamine transporters (DaT) in the brain. A specific marker for DaT, DaTscan produces images that provide visual evidence based on the density of dopamine transporters.DaTscan was the first FDA-approved radiopharmaceutical adjunct imaging agent to help physicians evaluate patients with suspected Parkinsonian syndromes (PS), such as Parkinson's disease (PD).DaTscan has been available in the US since 2011 and has been used in more than 1 million patients in 40 countries.About GE Healthcare:GE Healthcare is the $17.7 billion healthcare business of GE (NYSE: GE).

494,f640ecc2-a8d7-3c9d-a43e-8d0a3935a31a,PGR,2022-11-03,The Progressive Corporation (NYSE:PGR) Has Fared Decently But Fundamentals Look Uncertain: What Lies Ahead For The Stock?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/progressive-corporation-nyse-pgr-fared-130032426.html,1667480432,STORY,['PGR'],"[Progressive's (NYSE:PGR) stock up by 9.4% over the past three months. Given that the stock prices usually follow long-term business performance, we wonder if the company's mixed financials could have any adverse effect on its current price price movement Particularly, we will be paying attention to Progressive's  ROE today.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. See our latest analysis for Progressive How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Progressive is:5.8% = US$857m ÷ US$15b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.06 in profit.What Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Progressive's Earnings Growth And 5.8% ROEAt first glance, Progressive's ROE doesn't look very promising. We then compared the company's ROE to the broader industry and were disappointed to see that the ROE is lower than the industry average of 10%. Progressive was still able to see a decent net income growth of 7.1% over the past five years. So, the growth in the company's earnings could probably have been caused by other variables. For example, it is possible that the company's management has made some good strategic decisions, or that the company has a low payout ratio.Story continuesWe then compared Progressive's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 12% in the same period, which is a bit concerning.past-earnings-growthThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Is PGR fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.Is Progressive Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?The high three-year median payout ratio of 50% (or a retention ratio of 50%) for Progressive suggests that the company's growth wasn't really hampered despite it returning most of its income to its shareholders.Besides, Progressive has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 40% over the next three years. As a result, the expected drop in Progressive's payout ratio explains the anticipated rise in the company's future ROE to 23%, over the same period.ConclusionOn the whole, we feel that the performance shown by Progressive can be open to many interpretations. Although the company has shown a fair bit of growth in earnings, the reinvestment rate is low. Meaning, the earnings growth number could have been significantly higher had the company been retaining more of its profits and reinvesting that at a higher rate of return. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

497,dbc6e16a-f296-3917-be07-ae32bf05b88c,VLO,2022-11-03,Is Trending Stock Valero Energy Corporation (VLO) a Buy Now?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-valero-energy-corporation-130001015.html,1667394001,STORY,['VLO'],"[Valero Energy (VLO) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this oil refiner have returned +10.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.7% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Valero Energy belongs, has gained 19.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.Valero Energy is expected to post earnings of $6.84 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +176.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +11.8%.The consensus earnings estimate of $27.76 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +887.9%. This estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.79 indicates a change of -32.3% from what Valero Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +6.4%.Story continuesWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Valero Energy.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for VLO _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Valero Energy, the consensus sales estimate of $40.13 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +11.8%. The $174.77 billion and $144.28 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +53.3% and -17.5%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryValero Energy reported revenues of $44.45 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +50.6%. EPS of $7.14 for the same period compares with $1.22 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $39.01 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +13.94%. The EPS surprise was +2%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Valero Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Valero Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out Dividend Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks By Hedge Funds. High bond yields have been a positive addition to the portfolios of income investors after years of nominal fixed-income returns. However, dividend stocks still provide essential balance and additional income to an asset portfolio, and they help combat the high inflation effectively. Jenny Harrington, CEO of Gilman Hill Asset Management, told Barron’s on October 29:“You need capital appreciation of the share price and growth of the dividend in an inflationary environment.”Dividend stocks have comparatively outperformed in the market selloff this year. Dividend-paying entities in the S&amp;P 500 have dropped 11%, compared to the 19% decline in the S&amp;P 500 benchmark and the 23% drop in non-dividend stocks so far this year. Income stocks are attractive amid market volatility since they protect investors against plummeting share prices. Stephanie Link, the chief investment strategist and portfolio manager at Hightower Advisors, advised investors to focus on dividend growth prospects rather than high yields alone. She further said:“If companies are going to continue to increase their dividends, then I feel good about them.”Similarly, David Katz, chief investment officer at Matrix Advisors, noted that although Treasury yield has risen which means that bond payout is attractive at about 4%, dividend stocks provide the potential for increasing payouts while bond payments remain fixed. Some of the best entities for a dividend stock portfolio include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA). Our Methodology We selected the following dividend stocks based on their popularity among elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the second quarter of 2022. We have also mentioned the latest analyst coverage, underlying business fundamentals, and recent dividend payouts by the companies for additional context for readers. The dividend yields are mentioned as of November 2. Story continuesDividend Stock Portfolio: Top 10 Stock Picks By Hedge FundsPhoto by Mirza Babic on UnsplashDividend Stock Portfolio: Top Stock Picks By Hedge Funds10. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Dividend Yield as of November 2: 1.08%S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is a New York-based provider of credit ratings, benchmarks, data analytics, and workflow solutions in the global capital and commodity markets. The company operates through six divisions – S&amp;P Global Ratings, S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices, S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights, S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, S&amp;P Global Mobility, and S&amp;P Global Engineering Solutions. S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) declared on September 28 a $0.85 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on December 12, to shareholders of record on November 18. As of October 27, S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) has completed $11 billion of its $12 billion accelerated share repurchase program year-to-date, and it expects to launch the remaining $1 billion of the authorized repurchase units in December.Argus analyst John Eade on November 1 maintained a Buy recommendation on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) but lowered the price target on the shares to $365 from $420. The company has almost concluded a multi-year restructuring and is now focused on its rapidly growing financial businesses, including the lucrative and not very competitive business of rating bonds, the analyst told investors in a research note. The analyst also added that he believes S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) management can pull through the tough inflation and high interest rate environment.According to Insider Monkey’s database, 84 hedge funds were bullish on S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) at the end of June 2022, compared to 97 funds in the prior quarter. Chris Hohn’s TCI Fund Management is the largest position holder in the company, with 8.76 million shares worth nearly $3 billion. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) is one of the top picks of elite investors for a dividend stock portfolio. Here is what Baron Durable Advantage Fund has to say about S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Another example is S&amp;P Global (NYSE:SPGI), the leading rating agency and data provider, whose stock declined 29.0% year-to-date and 17.5% during the second quarter as a result of growing investor concerns over the slowdown in debt issuance. While debt issuance volumes have seen a dramatic decline – the worst quarterly decline in a decade (down 41% year-over-year in the second quarter based on Goldman Sachs estimates), – and this led management to withdraw its 2022 guidance in early June, we do not believe it would result in a permanent loss of capital.First, ratings represent only about 30% of S&amp;P Global’s total revenues. Second, despite inherent volatility in quarterly or annual issuance, over the long-term issuance volumes follow the trends in levels of debt outstanding, which has compounded in the mid-single digits for many years. Lastly, we believe that S&amp;P Global’s strong competitive positioning will enable it to continue benefiting from pricing power, while taking advantage of secular tailwinds such as the growth in passive and ESG investing, international expansion, and the growing demand for data analytics.”9. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Dividend Yield as of November 2: 0.12%NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), the American multinational technology and semiconductor firm, is one of the most popular picks of hedge funds for a dividend stock portfolio. At the end of October, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock gained as investors turned their attention towards the semiconductor industry in the midst of the Intel and Mobileye spin-off. On October 24, Barclays analyst Blayne Curtis maintained an Overweight rating on NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) but lowered the price target on the shares to $140 from $190. The analyst is ""actively looking for a bottom to get more positive"" on the semiconductor sector and sees it closer in some end markets than others, but still believes ""it is too early to pull the trigger across the board."" According to Insider Monkey’s data, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was part of 84 hedge fund portfolios at the end of June 2022, compared to 102 in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is a significant position holder in the company, with 7.6 million shares worth $1.15 billion.  Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a fabless semiconductor company and a leader in gaming and accelerated computing. NVIDIA is powering the growth of AI from the data center to the edge. Shares detracted due to inventory right sizing in NVIDIA’s gaming segment coupled with the broader market sell-off in growth stocks. Given NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, we believe the company can sustain its growth trajectory. See further discussion of NVIDIA in the top net purchases section below.During the third quarter, we took advantage of its stock sell-off to add to NVIDIA Corporation, a fabless semiconductor mega cap that is a global leader in gaming cards and accelerated computing hardware and software. The sell-off was driven by a near-term inventory correction in gaming as a result of a COVID-related pull forward in demand as well as the shift in the Ethereum cryptocurrency from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake. Additionally, investors are concerned over the potential slowdown in data center revenues as a result of a weaker macroeconomic environment as well as the recently announced limitations on semiconductor shipments to China. Despite the near-term uncertainty, we believe that NVIDIA’s end-to-end AI platform and its leading market share in gaming, data centers, and autonomous machines, along with the size of these markets, would enable the company to benefit from durable growth for years to come and therefore view the stock price where we added shares as a compelling value for long-term investors. With demand for computing power doubling every one to two years, and Moore’s Law slowing down, there is more need for computing than ever. At the same time, “near free” supply growth (that was possible thanks to Moore’s Law) has slowed dramatically. NVIDIA’s accelerated architecture, with parallel computing at scale, answers that need.”8. UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 91Dividend Yield as of November 2: 1.20%UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) operates as a diversified health care company in the United States.

Here is what the fund said:“UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) reported solid quarterly results and raised 2022 guidance modestly. Additionally, managed care is another industry that is viewed as defensive in the current environment, which helped support UnitedHealth and its peer group.”7. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 93Dividend Yield as of November 2: 0.24%Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is a Massachusetts-based provider of life sciences solutions, analytical instruments, specialty diagnostics, and laboratory products and services worldwide. As per elite hedge funds, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is one of the premier picks for a dividend stock portfolio. On October 31, Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) announced that it is acquiring the UK-based diagnostic products maker, The Binding Site, for $2.6 billion from private equity firm Nordic Capital in an all-cash transaction. Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) also said that throughout Q4, it expects to execute a $1 billion share buyback program, bringing the total capital spent on buybacks in 2022 to $3 billion.Baird analyst Catherine Ramsey Schulte on November 1 reiterated an Outperform rating on Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) but lowered the price target on the shares to $665 from $695. The analyst noted that Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO)’s Specialty Diagnostics segment typically gets the least investor attention and interest, but she forecasts the deal to be accretive to both overall revenue growth and margins. She also updated her model to factor in the acquisition, Q4 and full-year buyback assumptions, and 2023 forex headwinds.According to Insider Monkey’s data, 93 hedge funds were bullish on Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) at the end of June 2022, compared to 101 funds in the prior quarter. Thomas Steyer’s Farallon Capital is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 1.2 million shares worth $675 million. Here is what Baron Funds specifically said about Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) is the world’s largest life sciences tools company. Shares fell due to the rotation out of life sciences tools stocks, driven by concerns about a possible global recession, foreign currency exposure, COVID-related lockdowns in China, and reduced levels of biotechnology funding. We continue to believe Thermo Fisher has a strong long-term growth outlook given a large and growing addressable market coupled with its industry-leading scale, commercial infrastructure, e-commerce platform, supply-chain capabilities, and R&amp;D investment.”6. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 99Dividend Yield as of November 2: 2.42%Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is an American multinational company that provides banking and financial products and services. The bank operates through Consumer Banking, Global Wealth &amp; Investment Management, Global Banking, and Global Markets segments. On October 17, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) reported earnings for the third quarter of 2022, announcing earnings per share of $0.81 and a revenue of $24.50 billion, topping market estimates by $0.04 and $1.05 billion, respectively. On October 19, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.22 per share, in line with previous. The dividend is distributable on December 30, to shareholders of record on December 2. Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) delivers a dividend yield of 2.42% as of November 2. BMO Capital analyst James Fotheringham raised the price target on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) on October 18 to $42 from $41 but kept a Market Perform rating on the shares. The analyst cited Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)’s ""impressive"" Q3 top-line beat and ""meaningful"" operating leverage as its pre-provision net revenue grew 24% compared to Q2 2022. However, the analyst added that it remains too early to purchase bank stocks, and he believes that Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) stock will struggle until the economic backdrop stabilizes.Among the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 99 funds were bullish on Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) at the end of Q2 2022, with collective stakes worth $36 billion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with more than 1 billion shares worth $31.4 billion. Like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is one of the premier stocks to consider for a robust dividend stock portfolio. Here is what Artisan Partners specifically said about Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“We made only one new purchase during the quarter, initiating a position in Bank of America (BAC). As one of America’s largest banks, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) is second only to JPMorgan Chase (JPM) in size and is probably its closest peer. Both are well-run banks, but compared to JPM, since the GFC, BAC has retired more shares, grown EPS faster and currently has more capital and a lower dividend payout. We are attracted to BAC’s strong capital base, high capital generation capacity, large loan loss reserve, low (~50%) loan/deposit ratio, short duration investment securities book, and low dividend payout that provides financial flexibility. BAC has a less volatile earnings stream than JPM with lower capital market sensitive exposures. Additionally, BAC is rigorously stress tested by the Fed every year in quantitative and qualitative fashion. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which we hold in the portfolio, owns 12% of BAC. He petitioned the Fed to own more than 10%, so he clearly likes it. Bank stocks were strong gainers in 2021 on the prospects of higher rates boosting net interest margins, but the stocks pulled back in the first half of 2022 on economic concerns. We believe BAC has massive scale advantages, should benefit from increasing interest rates, particularly in the 2-year part of the yield curve, and should grow over time with the economy. The economic environment is highly uncertain, but current consensus includes the provision for losses more than doubling and capital markets activity slowing. Against that backdrop, our purchase price equated to about 8.5X our estimates of “mid-cycle” earnings. With leading businesses, a double-digit ROE, a prudent capital return strategy and a strong balance sheet, we believe this entry point offers a solid long-term value.” Click to continue reading and see Dividend Stock Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks By Hedge Funds.  Suggested articles:10 Best Infrastructure Stocks To Buy Now12 Best Bank Dividend Stocks To Invest In15 Best NASDAQ Dividend Stocks To Buy Disclosure: None.

So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Over the past month, shares of this largest U.S. health insurer have returned +4.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry, which UnitedHealth falls in, has gained 9.2%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, UnitedHealth is expected to post earnings of $5.18 per share, indicating a change of +15.6% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -3.3% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $21.97 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +15.5%. This estimate has changed +0.6% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $24.89 indicates a change of +13.3% from what UnitedHealth is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.6%.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, UnitedHealth is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for UNH _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For UnitedHealth, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $81.53 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +10.6%. For the current and next fiscal years, $322.88 billion and $351.51 billion estimates indicate +12.3% and +8.9% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryUnitedHealth reported revenues of $80.89 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +11.8%. EPS of $5.79 for the same period compares with $4.52 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $80.72 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.21%. The EPS surprise was +6.24%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.UnitedHealth is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about UnitedHealth. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

A lower ratio indicates a tight rein on the insurer's medical costs.Humana's guidance to enroll 325,000 to 400,000 Medicare Advantage members next year marks a return to the industry's rate one year ahead of schedule, Stephens analyst Scott Fidel said in a note.Chief Executive Officer Bruce Broussard said the insurer could probably do a ""medium to smaller"" deal at this time in the primary care business.""We've looked at some of the larger transactions out there ... not really convinced that's the right direction for us,"" Broussard said.Recent mediareportshave suggested that Humana is among the top bidders to acquire primary care provider Cano Health Inc.Humana said its adjusted profit for the third quarter was $6.88 per share, above estimates of $6.28, according to Refinitiv data.

This compares to FFO of $6.94 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 7.51%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this data center operator would post FFO of $7.30 per share when it actually produced FFO of $7.58, delivering a surprise of 3.84%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates two times.Equinix , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry, posted revenues of $1.84 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.33%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $1.68 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates two times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Equinix shares have lost about 34.4% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.1%.What's Next for Equinix?While Equinix has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Equinix: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected an increase of 195,000 jobs.""Anytime you see (data) where the employment numbers are strong, it's going to be negative, just in the sense that rates are going to continue to go higher,"" said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.The private payrolls report follows a survey on Tuesday that showed a jump in U.S. monthly job openings, which pointed to strong labor demand and doused hopes of a change in the central bank's aggressive policy approach that had helped drive a strong rally for stocks in October.Hopes of a less hawkish Fed had been driven by a previous batch of data pointing to a softening economy. A report on Tuesday also showed a slowdown in U.S. manufacturing activity growth in October.""We've been seeing conflicting data. It hasn't been clear enough to say that they (the Fed) are going to slow down, but it's not clear enough for them to continue to raise at 75 (bps) either,"" Saluzzi said.Story continuesTraders are split on the odds of a 50 bps or 75 bps rate hike in December, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.The Fed's interest rate decision is due at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), but focus will be on commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell later.The non-farm payrolls report due on Friday will offer further clues on the outlook for interest rates.With the third-quarter earnings season having crossed the halfway mark, earnings growth estimates for S&amp;P 500 companies have been slightly revised up to 4.8% from 4.7% the previous day.Advanced Micro Devices Inc rose 2.2% after it forecast some strength in its data center business, while Airbnb Inc tumbled 8.9% on a bleak holiday-quarter revenue forecast. At 12:57 ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 68.79 points, or 0.21%, at 32,584.41, the S&amp;P 500 was down 21.15 points, or 0.55%, at 3,834.95, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 106.60 points, or 0.98%, at 10,784.25.Among other stocks, CVS Health Corp advanced 4.6% after raising its annual profit forecast, while Estee Lauder cut its full-year sales outlook, sending the cosmetics maker's shares down 9%.Tinder-owner Match Group rose 8.5% after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter revenue.Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.27-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and 2.03-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&amp;P index recorded nine new 52-week highs and 11 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 50 new highs and 121 new lows.

Alex, what are the details in this latest earnings spree?ALEXANDRA SEMENOVA: Well, Jared, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve today. But we are still in the throes of earnings season, with a lot of headliners this morning. One of them is Estee Lauder. Shares were down about 6% at last glance after the company indicated that it wouldn't see a return to growth until 2023. Estee Lauder slashed its full-year forecast, blaming lockdowns in China and also saying that some retailers are taking its cosmetics and perfumes off of their shelves amid worries of an economic slowdown.Notable also that this announcement comes ahead of a crucial holiday season for them. The company now expects net sales for 2023 to decrease to 6% to 8% compared to its prior forecast of growth of 3% to 5%. And like its peers in the consumer discretionary sector, such as Nike and Levi's, it's also citing currency headwinds as a stronger dollar eats into its international profits.Now, makeup demand might be slowing down, but people are still lining up to KFC and Taco Bell. Yum Brands missed estimates on earnings per share, also citing currency headwinds and a loss in profits from its KFC exit from Russia. But it did report rising sales across its fast food chains, even as fast food restaurants are raising prices to keep up with rising commodity and labor costs. People are still flocking to them, opting for more value-oriented options. We saw that with McDonald's last week as they shy away from more expensive dine out options amid inflation.And finally, Paramount Global is also a mover today. Shares were down as much as 10% this morning after the company missed Wall Street estimates on third quarter earnings. Paramount's profit hit was the result of larger investments in content to boost its business, while weakness in advertising revenue also weighed on the quarter.

Economists polled by Reuters had expected an increase of 195,000 jobs.It follows a survey on Tuesday that showed a jump in U.S. monthly job openings, which pointed to strong labor demand and doused hopes of a change in the central bank's aggressive policy approach, which helped drive a strong rally for stocks in October.Still, traders are split on the odds of a 50 bps or 75 bps rate hike in December, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.The Fed's interest rate decision is due at 2 p.m. ET (1800 GMT), but focus will be on commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell later.""The Fed has said they're going to be data dependent and that is not good because the inflation numbers are still high and unemployment is low,"" said Fall Ainina, director of research at James Investments.""The numbers are still not there for the Fed to really pivot.""Story continuesThe non-farm payrolls report due on Friday will offer further clues on the outlook for interest rates.Advanced Micro Devices Inc rose 3.5% after it forecast some strength in its data center business, while Airbnb Inc tumbled 8.4% on a bleak holiday-quarter revenue forecast.At 10:21 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 140.27 points, or 0.43%, at 32,512.93, the S&amp;P 500 was down 24.00 points, or 0.62%, at 3,832.10, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 74.98 points, or 0.69%, at 10,815.87.Among other stocks, CVS Health Corp advanced 4.2% after raising its annual profit forecast, while Estee Lauder cut its full-year sales outlook, sending the cosmetics maker's shares down 7%.Tinder-owner Match Group rose 6.7% after reporting better-than-expected third-quarter revenue.Declining issues outnumbered advancers for a 2.86-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.94-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&amp;P index recorded four new 52-week highs and nine new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 84 new lows.

They are lower after the company reported earnings. But despite topping estimates, the company slashed its full year 2023 net sales forecast, as it now anticipates a decrease of 6% to 8% shares lower by about 7% right now here in-- for the company. And what they did report within this most recent quarter-- I mean net sales of $3.93 billion, a decline of 11% from the same period last year.- A lot of red flags in this quarter. We'll start on Asia. They're calling out weakness in Asia. Really, I think mirrored what I heard from P&amp;G, they own that SK2 line in China. It has been a big business for them, but that started to weak-- weaken in their most recent quarter. So Estee Lauder calling that out as well. Also calling out tightening of inventory by some retailers in the United States-- very interesting as well, curious on what that means for an Ulta when they report in a few weeks, but also curious what it may mean for department stores. Of course, you walk into department stores. You talk about it. We look-- we're always looking for Tom Ford cologne. Always, you walk into these stores.- You go to Zara instead.- I know. You're here with a lot of cosmetics sections. So I'm wondering how the back half of these quarters played out for department stores and a lot of other players off of these Estee Lauder numbers.- I mean that updated guidance is just dramatic, right? That now-- they're now expecting a pretty steep decline in sales versus gain. They also cut their earnings per share forecast, by the way. And I just want to reiterate those numbers. Because again, it was pretty shocking when I saw this headline. The new forecast for the full year, $5.1 to $5.21. The earlier forecasts have been $7.11 to $7.33. We're talking about a $2 downgrade in the earnings per share forecast, which is pretty remarkable here. So that's one thing I wanted to flag.Story continuesSecondly, it does feel like what we're hearing from the cosmetic companies is a little bit lumpy. In other words, some do seem to be holding up OK. So as we get more information from them, which are, which aren't, is it the department store piece that is the issue here? And the Ultas of the world are doing better? I'm curious to see how that plays out.- I'm interested by the Asia-- not the Asia cloth, the travel retail grow up because--- Yep.- --we've been getting great numbers. Airbnb- sure, stocks getting digged on the results. But that was a strong quarter. All the hotels, strong quarters. Airlines, strong quarters. So trying to figure out, is this a leading indicator of what might be to come this holiday season? Either way, it's not a good sign.- Or did you spend all your money on your lodging and your hotel ticket, and you've got nothing left to buy on the Duty Free? I don't know.- Yeah.- Yeah.- Are you buying booze at the travel center?- I mean, well, why not? It is a vacation.- Round alcohol, right?- Well, of course. Always. It's got to be. They did say, in this quarter though, fragrance and haircare to your point. They each rose the hard turn, I guess. They each rose double digits organically. However, you mentioned kind of travel and specifically, in the Asian markets as well, skin care most challenged by COVID-19 restrictions in China, significantly impacting the--- Interesting. So that China thing emerging as a theme, even as we get murmurings of perhaps reopening in China. It certainly doesn't appear to be happening--]"

Income from operations was $50.6 million, compared to a loss from operations of $50.6 million in the third quarter of 2021. Net income was $28.0 million, or $0.30 diluted earnings per share, compared to net loss of $66.0 million, or $0.72 diluted loss per share, in the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted income from operations1 was $92.0 million, compared to $72.5 million in the third quarter of 2021. Adjusted diluted earnings per share1 was $0.65, compared to $0.44 in the third quarter of last year. Cash flow from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, was $43.1 million, compared to $202.2 million in the same period of 2021. Free cash flow2 was an outflow of $62.9 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, compared to an inflow of $116.4 million in the same period of 2021.KEY BUSINESS HIGHLIGHTSOrganic revenues grew 10.9% compared to the third quarter of 2021. Secure Information Destruction (“SID”) organic revenue grew 32.3%, mainly driven by higher service and recycling revenues and the impact of non-recurring typical ERP start-up challenges experienced in the third quarter of 2021. Regulated Waste and Compliance Services (“RWCS”) organic revenue grew 2.2%.Pricing levers helped offset labor and other supply chain inflationary cost pressures in the third quarter of 2022. As a result, the Adjusted EBITDA1 margin percentage improved 130 basis points compared to the second quarter of 2022.Cash flow from operations was $61.5 million in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $8.7 million compared to the third quarter of 2021, and an increase of $41.1 million compared to the second quarter of 2022.Adjusted EPS1 was $0.65 in the third quarter of 2022, an increase of $0.21 compared to the third quarter of 2021, and an increase of $0.17 compared to the second quarter of 2022.Story continues“Our third quarter results build upon the momentum we began to experience in the second quarter, as revenue, margin, adjusted earnings per share, and free cash flow all improved. We remain focused on executing on our five key business priorities and continuing this momentum through the rest of this year,” said Cindy J. Miller, President and Chief Executive Officer.(1)   Adjusted financial measures are Non-GAAP measures and exclude adjusting items as described and reconciled to comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures in the Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures contained in this Press Release. Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is Income from operations excluding certain adjusting items, depreciation and intangible amortization. (2)   Free cash flow is calculated as Net cash from operating activities less Capital expenditures.THIRD QUARTER FINANCIAL RESULTS U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) ResultsRevenues in the third quarter were $690.3 million, compared to $648.9 million in the third quarter of 2021. The $41.4 million increase was primarily due to organic revenue growth of $60.5 million in SID, $10.2 million in RWCS, and the impact of an acquisition of $2.0 million. Partially offsetting these increases were unfavorable foreign exchange rates of $18.0 million and the impact of divestitures of $13.3 million.Income from operations in the third quarter was $50.6 million, compared to a loss from operations in the third quarter of 2021 of $50.6 million. The $101.2 million increase was primarily due to the FCPA litigation settlement accrual recorded in the third quarter of 2021 of $61.0 million; 2022 commercial pricing levers resulting in revenue flow through of $34.6 million; non-recurring typical ERP start-up challenges in the third quarter of 2021 of $13.2 million; divestiture losses in the third quarter of 2021 of $10.9 million; and lower annual incentive compensation expense in 2022 of $3.6 million. These were partially offset by higher supply chain, wage adjustments, and other inflationary costs of approximately $19.2 million; higher bad debt expense of $9.2 million; and higher headcount and onboarding costs of approximately $6.3 million.Net income in the third quarter was $28.0 million, or $0.30 diluted earnings per share, compared to a net loss of $66.0 million, or $0.72 diluted loss per share in the third quarter of 2021. The difference was primarily attributable to higher income from operations of $101.2 million, as explained above.Cash flow from operations for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, was $43.1 million, compared to $202.2 million in the same period of 2021. The year-over-year decline of $159.1 million was primarily driven by the FCPA settlement payments in 2022 of $81.0 million; timing of vendor payments of $36.2 million; increase in DSO that equates to $30.3 million; and higher interest payments of $9.3 million.Cash paid for capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2022, was $106.0 million, compared to $85.8 million in the same period of 2021. The $20.2 million increase was mainly attributable to the timing of cash payments.Non-GAAP Results1,2 For the third quarter of 2022, organic revenues increased 10.9%, which excludes the impact of divestitures, an acquisition and the impact of foreign exchange rates. SID organic revenues grew 32.3%, mainly due to higher service and recycling revenues and non-recurring typical ERP start-up challenges experienced in the third quarter of 2021. RWCS organic revenues grew 2.2%.Adjusted income from operations was $92.0 million compared to $72.5 million in the third quarter of 2021. As a percentage of revenues, the 210 basis points increase was primarily driven by revenue flow through of approximately 500 basis points; non-recurring typical ERP start-up challenges in the third quarter of 2021 of approximately 190 basis points; and lower annual incentive compensation expense of approximately 50 basis points. These were partially offset by higher supply chain, wage adjustments and other inflationary costs of approximately 280 basis points; higher bad debt expense of approximately 130 basis points; higher headcount and onboarding costs of approximately 90 basis points; and higher ongoing IT operating expenditures of approximately 70 basis points.Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.65 compared to $0.44 in the third quarter of 2021. Excluding the impact from divestitures, an acquisition and the impact of foreign exchange rates of $0.01, the remaining $0.22 increase was driven by revenue flow through of $0.31; non-recurring typical ERP start-up challenges in the third quarter of 2021 of $0.11; and tax, interest and other of $0.05. These were partially offset by higher supply chain, wage adjustments and other inflationary costs of $0.16; higher headcount and onboarding costs of $0.05; and higher ongoing IT operating expenditures of $0.04.Free cash flow for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 was an outflow of $62.9 million, compared to an inflow of $116.4 million in the same period of 2021. The $179.3 million decrease was primarily due to lower cash flow from operations of $159.1 million, which reflects the FCPA settlement payments in 2022 of $81.0 million, and increased cash paid for capital expenditures of $20.2 million, as explained above.(1)   Adjusted financial measures are Non-GAAP measures and exclude adjusting items as described and reconciled to comparable U.S. GAAP financial measures in the Reconciliation of U.S. GAAP to Non-GAAP Financial Measures contained in this Press Release.(2)   Free cash flow is calculated as Net cash from operating activities less Capital expenditures.

When we use words such as “believes”, “expects”, “anticipates”, “estimates”, “may”, “plan”, “will”, “goal”, or similar expressions, we are making forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are prospective in nature and are not based on historical facts, but rather on current expectations and projections of our management about future events and are therefore subject to risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from the future results expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause such differences include, among others, inflationary cost pressure in labor, supply chain, energy, and other expenses, decreases in the volume of regulated wastes or personal and confidential information collected from customers, the ability to implement the remaining phases of our ERP system, and disruptions resulting from deployment of our ERP system, disruptions in our supply chain, disruptions in or attacks on information technology systems, labor shortages, a recession or economic disruption in the U.S. and other countries resulting from the COVID-19 virus or otherwise, changing market conditions in the healthcare industry, competition and demand for services in the regulated waste and secure information destruction industries, SOP pricing volatility, foreign exchange rate volatility in the jurisdictions in which we operate, changes in governmental regulation of the collection, transportation, treatment and disposal of regulated waste or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information, the level of government enforcement of regulations governing regulated waste collection and treatment or the proper handling and protection of personal and confidential information, charges related to portfolio optimization or the failure of acquisitions or divestitures to achieve the desired results, failure to consummate transactions with respect to non-core businesses, the obligations to service substantial indebtedness and comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our credit agreements and notes, rising interest rates or a downgrade in our credit rating resulting in an increase in interest expense, political, economic, inflationary and other risks related to our foreign operations, developments in the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on the results of operations, long-term remote work arrangements which may adversely affect our business, measures taken by governmental authorities to prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus which could disrupt our supply chain, result in disruptions in transportation services and restrictions on the ability of our team members to travel, result in temporary closure of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers, affect the volume of paper processed by our secure information destruction business and the revenue generated from the sale of SOP, weather and environmental changes related to climate change, requirements of customers and investors for net carbon zero emissions strategies, and the introduction of regulations for greenhouse gases, which could negatively affect our costs to operate, the outcome of pending, future or settled litigation or investigations including with respect to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and foreign anti-corruption laws, failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, as well as other factors described in our filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including our Annual Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-Q.

office paper) pricing and volume and excludes the impact of divestitures, acquisitions and foreign exchange.(3)   The comparisons at constant currency rates (foreign exchange) reflect comparative local currency balances at prior period’s foreign exchange rates. Stericycle calculated these percentages by taking current period reported Revenues less the respective prior period reported Revenues, divided by the prior period reported Revenues, all at the respective prior period’s foreign exchange rates. This measure provides information on the change in Revenues assuming that foreign currency exchange rates have not changed between the prior and the current period.

The Non-GAAP financial measures contained in this press release may not be calculated in the same manner as certain other Non-GAAP financial measures and are used solely to evaluate management’s performance for incentive compensation purposes. All Non-GAAP financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable U.S. GAAP measures and should not be considered in isolation from, or a replacement for, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and may not be comparable to or calculated in the same manner as Non-GAAP financial measures published by other companies.Three months ended September 30, 2021, excludes depreciation charges of $0.1 million, which is included in ERP Implementation.Adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization (Adjusted EBITDA) is Income from operations excluding certain adjusting items, depreciation and intangible amortization.Under the Net Income Attributable to Common Shareholders column, adjustments are shown net of tax in aggregate of $9.6 million and $16.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively, based on applying the statutory tax rate for the jurisdictions in which the adjustment occurred or, by adjusting the tax effect to consider the impact of applying an annual effective tax rate on an interim basis. For purposes of reconciling adjusted diluted earnings per share with respect to taxes period-over-period, the company utilizes a “rate approach” to highlight the impact of the adjusted tax rate. It is computed by multiplying the prior period adjusted rate by the current period adjusted income before taxes to determine the expected tax expense. Such expected tax expense is then compared to actual tax expense. Expected tax in excess of actual tax variance is favorable; actual tax in excess of expected tax variance is unfavorable. The variance divided by diluted shares outstanding at the end of the period yields the impact on earnings per share. Management believes the use of this measure best aids in explaining the impact of a changing tax rate.Table 2-B: NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2022 and 2021(In millions, except per share data) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2022  Selling,General and Administrative Expenses Income from Operations Net IncomeAttributable to Common Shareholdersd Diluted EarningsPer ShareU.S. GAAP Financial Measures $676.5  $94.6 $24.2 $0.26Adjustments:        ERP Implementation1  (13.0)  13.0  9.8  0.11Intangible Amortization2  (94.7)  94.7  73.4  0.79Portfolio Optimization3  (2.7)  2.7  2.0  0.02Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance4  (26.0)  26.0  22.0  0.24Asset Impairments5  (2.0)  2.0  1.5  0.02Other Tax Matter6  —   —  —  —Total Adjustments  (138.4)  138.4  108.7  1.18Adjusted Financial Measuresa $538.1  $233.0 $132.9 $1.44Depreciation    81.5    Adjusted EBITDAc   $314.5    (In millions, except per share data) Nine Months Ended September 30, 2021  Selling,General and Administrative Expenses Income from Operations Net (Loss) IncomeAttributable to Common Shareholdersd Diluted (Loss) EarningsPer ShareU.S. GAAP Financial Measures $695.2  $64.1 $(10.6) $(0.11)Adjustments:        ERP Implementation1  (49.8)  49.8  37.1   0.40 Intangible Amortization2  (89.1)  89.1  68.4   0.74 Portfolio Optimization3  (2.9)  13.8  8.7   0.09 Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance4  (71.4)  71.4  68.7   0.75 Asset Impairments5  —   —  —   — Other Tax Matter6  —   —  (5.5)  (0.06)Total Adjustments  (213.2)  224.1  177.4   1.92 Adjusted Financial Measuresa $482.0  $288.2 $166.8  $1.81 Depreciationb    77.3    Adjusted EBITDAc   $365.5    (In millions, except per share data) Year-to-Date 2022 Change Compared to 2021  Selling,General and Administrative Expenses Income from Operations Net Income (Loss)Attributable to Common Shareholders Diluted Earnings (Loss) Per ShareU.S. GAAP Financial Measures $(18.7) $30.5  $34.8  $0.37 Adjustments:        ERP Implementation  36.8   (36.8)  (27.3)  (0.29)Intangible Amortization  (5.6)  5.6   5.0   0.05 Portfolio Optimization  0.2   (11.1)  (6.7)  (0.07)Litigation, Settlements and Regulatory Compliance  45.4   (45.4)  (46.7)  (0.51)Asset Impairments  (2.0)  2.0   1.5   0.02 Other Tax Matter  —   —   5.5   0.06 Total Adjustments  74.8   (85.7)  (68.7)  (0.74)Adjusted Financial Measures $56.1  $(55.2) $(33.9) $(0.37)Depreciation    4.2     Adjusted EBITDA   $(51.0)    The following table provides adjustments to Income from operations categorized as follows:(In millions) Nine Months Ended September 30,  2022  2021Non-Cash Related7$96.7 $99.4Cash Related 41.7  124.7Total$138.4 $224.1U.S. GAAP results for the nine months ended September 30, 2022 and 2021 include:ERP Implementation: In 2022, SG&amp;A includes $13.0 million of consulting and professional fees related to our ERP Implementation.

But how do you know whether a REIT is undervalued?REITs can be evaluated in two ways. First, if the current dividend yield is higher than its long-term average, the REIT is said to be undervalued. If the yield is less than its long-term average, the REIT is overvalued.Second, we look at funds from operations (FFO) in relation to the stock price. The formula P/FFO means to divide the stock price (P) by the FFO. This is similar to P/E ratios in non-REIT stocks. If the P/FFO is substantially lower than its same-sector peers (healthcare, retail, industrial, etc.), then the REIT is said to be undervalued.Given the criteria above, here are three REITs that appear to be currently undervalued.REIT NAMEP/FFOP/FFO SECTOR AVGRECENT DIVIDEND YIELD5-YR DIVIDEND YIELDSIMON PROPERTY GROUP INC.9.2113.466.42%5.84%SL GREEN REALTY CORP.5.8513.969.47%4.84%BRANDYWINE REALTY TRUST4.6913.9611.4%5.70%Simon Property Group Inc. (NYSE: SPG) is an Indianapolis-based retail REIT that owns and leases shopping malls, restaurants, outlet centers and entertainment venues. A member of the S&amp;P 100, Simon Property Group is one of the largest shopping mall REITs in the U.S. and also owns properties in Europe and Asia.October was an extremely difficult month for most REIT stocks, and Simon Property Group’s stock fell to a mid-month low of $86.02 but has since rebounded to $109. Its $7 annual dividend is now yielding 6.4%.One thing to admire about Simon Property Group is its resiliency. In 2020, when COVID-19 triggered a huge price decline, the stock traded below $37. But within 2½ years it had risen to $160. Could history repeat?SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE: SLG) is the largest owner and landlord of New York City offices, with 62 buildings totaling 33.6 million square feet.Story continuesInflation and recession fears have driven SL Green’s price back down to a recent 52-week low of $35.49. Still, the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10 is reasonable and third-quarter funds from operation (FFO) of $1.66 will easily cover three monthly dividend payments of $93.25. The $3.73 annual dividend now yields 9.4% and is 91% higher than its five-year average yield.History has shown that inflation and recessions come and go, so SL Green at its recent price near $40 could prove to be a bargain going forward.Brandywine Realty Trust (NYSE: BDN) is a Philadelphia-based commercial REIT that owns, develops, leases and manages 175 properties located from its home city to Austin, Texas.Brandywine Realty Trust’s 52-week range is $5.95 to $14.88, but like so many other REITs, its stock price has been decimated by higher interest rates this year.Brandywine’s quarterly dividend of $0.19 has been a stable but slow grower over the past five years and presently yields over 11% annually.Third-quarter 2022 FFO of $0.36 was a penny better than the third quarter of 2021, so covering the dividend payment is no problem. The stock is up about 10% since hitting the lows a few weeks ago. With its stable dividend and improving FFO, Brandywine Realty Trust could see additional appreciation in the near future.Read next: This Little-Known REIT Is Producing Double-Digit Returns In A Bear Market: How?See more real estate investment news and insights from BenzingaThe banking and investment platform Nada has launched its latest product Cityfunds, the first index-like fund for a single city’s residential real estate market.

This compares to FFO of $0.33 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an FFO surprise of 6.67%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this real estate investment trust would post FFO of $0.43 per share when it actually produced FFO of $0.49, delivering a surprise of 13.95%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus FFO estimates four times.Kite Realty Group , which belongs to the Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry, posted revenues of $200.31 million for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.71%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $71.47 million. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future FFO expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Kite Realty Group shares have lost about 8% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -19.1%.What's Next for Kite Realty Group?While Kite Realty Group has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's FFO outlook. Not only does this include current consensus FFO expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Kite Realty Group: favorable. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to outperform the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.It will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus FFO estimate is $0.46 on $193 million in revenues for the coming quarter and $1.84 on $779.9 million in revenues for the current fiscal year.Investors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, REIT and Equity Trust - Retail is currently in the bottom 45% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Another stock from the same industry, Macerich (MAC), has yet to report results for the quarter ended September 2022. The results are expected to be released on November 3.This shopping center real estate investment trust is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.47 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.4%.

See our latest analysis for Macerich How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for ROE is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Macerich is:1.1% = US$33m ÷ US$3.1b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.01.Does Macerich Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. Importantly, this is far from a perfect measure, because companies differ significantly within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Macerich has a lower ROE than the average (6.6%) in the REITs industry classification.roeThat's not what we like to see. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. When a company has low ROE but high debt levels, we would be cautious as the risk involved is too high. You can see the 3 risks we have identified for Macerich by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. That will make the ROE look better than if no debt was used.Story continuesMacerich's Debt And Its 1.1% ROEIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Macerich, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.49. With a fairly low ROE, and significant use of debt, it's hard to get excited about this business at the moment. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is useful for comparing the quality of different businesses. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. All else being equal, a higher ROE is better.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. Profit growth rates, versus the expectations reflected in the price of the stock, are a particularly important to consider. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

Horton (DHI) Reports Next Week: Wall Street Expects Earnings Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/d-r-horton-dhi-reports-140102347.html,1667397662,STORY,['DHI'],"[D.R. Horton (DHI) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2022. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 9. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis homebuilder is expected to post quarterly earnings of $5.09 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +37.6%.Revenues are expected to be $10.04 billion, up 23.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 8.42% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for D.R. Horton?For D.R. Horton, the Most Accurate Estimate is lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bearish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -17.07%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #5.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that D.R. Horton will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that D.R. Horton would post earnings of $4.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $4.67, delivering a surprise of +3.55%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.D.R. Horton doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Despite an increase, there is some slowdown in manufacturing activities, which can be linked to a softness in demand for electronics products. Persistent supply chain constraints and raw material cost inflation are added concerns for the industry. Manufacturing electronics companies have also been battling a perennial problem of labor shortages in the industry.Despite these headwinds, pricing actions to tackle cost inflation should aid the performances of Eaton Corporation plc ETN, Emerson Electric Co. EMR and AZZ Inc. AZZ.About the IndustryThe Zacks Manufacturing-Electronics industry comprises companies that manufacture electronic products like battery chargers, battery accessories, outdoor cabinet enclosures, power transmission products, electrical motion controls and motive power devices. Some industry players also provide water-treatment products, engineered flow components, process equipment and turn-key systems. These companies also offer state-of-the-art customer support and after-market services to end users. These companies are increasing investments for developing innovative technologies, boosting customer and employee experience as well as supply-chain modernization programs. The manufacturing electronic companies sell products and services in various end markets, including robotics, semiconductor, defense, aerospace, medical equipment and satellite communications.3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Manufacturing Electronics IndustrySupply Chain &amp; Cost Woes: The industry is plagued by persistent supply chain constraints, primarily related to semiconductor shortages, which are weighing on volumes and delaying deliveries. Labor shortages have been a perennial problem for the industry participants. High raw material and freight costs are denting the margins of these companies. Pricing actions to tackle inflationary pressure have provided relief to some extent.Softness in Demand: While manufacturing activity continues to expand, it is increasing at a slower pace, indicating some softness in demand for electronics products. In September, Institute for Supply Management’s (ISM) manufacturing PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index) touched 50.9% (a figure above 50 implies an expansion in manufacturing), reflecting growth in manufacturing activities for the 28th consecutive month. However, the index dipped 1.9 percentage points from the figure recorded in August, with New Orders and New Export Orders indexes contracting. Amid growing uncertainty in the economy, the demand environment is expected to remain volatile.Strength Across End-Markets: With continued expansion in manufacturing activities, strength across end-markets should drive growth of the industry. Well-diversified end-markets, including marine, mining, metal, energy, chemicals, power, renewable, life sciences, commercial, industrial, food, retail and other non-residential end markets, should help the industry players offset weakness in demand associated with a single market. Additionally, the digitalization of business operations is helping industry participants boost their competitiveness through enhanced operational productivity, product quality and better cost management.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Gloomy ProspectsThe Zacks Manufacturing – Electronics industry, housed within the broader Zacks Industrial Products sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #183. This rank places it in the bottom 27% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bleak near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.The industry’s positioning in the bottom 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of the negative earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the group’s 2022 earnings per share has decreased 12.5% over the past year.Despite the industry’s drab near-term prospects, we will present a few stocks that you may hold in your portfolios. But before that, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s stock market performance and current valuation.Industry Underperforms Sector &amp; S&amp;P 500The Zacks Manufacturing – Electronics industry has underperformed the broader sector and the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite index in the past year.Over this period, the industry has declined 19.8% compared with the sector and the S&amp;P 500 Index’s decrease of 16.5% and 18.8%.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of forward 12-month Price-to-Earnings (P/E), which is a commonly used multiple for valuing manufacturing stocks, the industry is currently trading at 18.83X compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 16.92X. It is also above the sector’s P/E ratio of 15.12X.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 26.63X, as low as 13.53X and at the median of 18.84X as the chart below shows.Price-to-Earnings RatioPrice-to-Earnings Ratio 3 Manufacturing - Electronics Stocks to Keep a Tab OnAZZ: Strategic transformation efforts, pricing actions and operational improvement initiatives are driving AZZ’s growth despite adversities such as high labor and raw material costs. Higher volumes for hot-dip galvanizing within the renewables, utility, OEM, and construction markets should continue to boost the company’s top line. The company sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. AZZ, provides metal coating services, welding solutions and specialty electrical equipment to a wide range of markets in North America. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s fiscal 2023 earnings has been revised upward by 44.1% in the past 90 days. Shares of the company have declined 12% in the past 60 days.Price and Consensus: AZZEaton: Investments in research and development programs to introduce products, including power management solutions, augur well for Eaton’s growth prospects. The acquisition of Royal Power Solutions (January 2022), which helps ETN expand in multiple growth markets in the United States, should drive its top line. The company carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Based in Dublin, Ireland, Eaton is a diversified power management company and a global technology leader in electrical components and systems. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s 2022 earnings has been revised northward by nearly 1% in the past 90 days. Shares of the company have gained 3.5% in the past six months.Price and Consensus: ETN Emerson: Emerson is poised to benefit from strong demand for its technology, software and solutions. Strength in the energy, chemicals, power, renewable, life sciences and metals and mining end markets is likely to support top-line growth. Focus on operational efficiency and cost-control measures bode well for the company’s bottom-line growth. Portfolio restructuring actions should foster EMR’s growth.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. Loss making companies can act like a sponge for capital - so investors should be cautious that they're not throwing good money after bad.If this kind of company isn't your style, you like companies that generate revenue, and even earn profits, then you may well be interested in Aflac (NYSE:AFL). Now this is not to say that the company presents the best investment opportunity around, but profitability is a key component to success in business. See our latest analysis for Aflac How Quickly Is Aflac Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That makes EPS growth an attractive quality for any company. It certainly is nice to see that Aflac has managed to grow EPS by 26% per year over three years. If the company can sustain that sort of growth, we'd expect shareholders to come away satisfied.One way to double-check a company's growth is to look at how its revenue, and earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins are changing. Our analysis has highlighted that Aflac's revenue from operations did not account for all of their revenue in the previous 12 months, so our analysis of its margins might not accurately reflect the underlying business. Aflac's EBIT margins are flat but, worryingly, its revenue is actually down. Suffice it to say that is not a great sign of growth.You can take a look at the company's revenue and earnings growth trend, in the chart below. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Aflac's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Aflac Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$42b company like Aflac. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$276m. We note that this amounts to 0.7% of the company, which may be small owing to the sheer size of Aflac but it's still worth mentioning. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Should You Add Aflac To Your Watchlist?You can't deny that Aflac has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate.

(NYSE:UHS)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/too-consider-buying-universal-health-143421767.html,1667399661,STORY,['UHS'],"[Universal Health Services, Inc. (NYSE:UHS), is not the largest company out there, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NYSE over the last few months. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Universal Health Services’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. Check out our latest analysis for Universal Health Services Is Universal Health Services Still Cheap?Great news for investors – Universal Health Services is still trading at a fairly cheap price according to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average. In this instance, I’ve used the price-to-earnings (PE) ratio given that there is not enough information to reliably forecast the stock’s cash flows. I find that Universal Health Services’s ratio of 11.59x is below its peer average of 19.86x, which indicates the stock is trading at a lower price compared to the Healthcare industry. However, given that Universal Health Services’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us another chance to buy in the future. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Universal Health Services look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. However, with a relatively muted profit growth of 7.9% expected over the next couple of years, growth doesn’t seem like a key driver for a buy decision for Universal Health Services, at least in the short term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since UHS is currently trading below the industry PE ratio, it may be a great time to accumulate more of your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as financial health to consider, which could explain the current price multiple.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on UHS for a while, now might be the time to make a leap. Its future profit outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy UHS. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed assessment.So while earnings quality is important, it's equally important to consider the risks facing Universal Health Services at this point in time.

537,ba4691ef-6e08-3106-b3a5-ba227a27696c,FCX,2022-11-03,Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX) Is Experiencing Growth In Returns On Capital,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/freeport-mcmoran-nyse-fcx-experiencing-165657404.html,1667408217,STORY,['FCX'],"[Finding a business that has the potential to grow substantially is not easy, but it is possible if we look at a few key financial metrics. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in Freeport-McMoRan's (NYSE:FCX) returns on capital, so let's have a look.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Freeport-McMoRan is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.18 = US$7.7b ÷ (US$50b - US$6.0b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2022).Therefore, Freeport-McMoRan has an ROCE of 18%. That's a pretty standard return and it's in line with the industry average of 18%. Check out our latest analysis for Freeport-McMoRan roceIn the above chart we have measured Freeport-McMoRan's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our free report on analyst forecasts for the company.What Can We Tell From Freeport-McMoRan's ROCE Trend?The trends we've noticed at Freeport-McMoRan are quite reassuring. Over the last five years, returns on capital employed have risen substantially to 18%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 38% more capital is being employed now too. The increasing returns on a growing amount of capital is common amongst multi-baggers and that's why we're impressed.The Bottom Line On Freeport-McMoRan's ROCETo sum it up, Freeport-McMoRan has proven it can reinvest in the business and generate higher returns on that capital employed, which is terrific. And with the stock having performed exceptionally well over the last five years, these patterns are being accounted for by investors. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if Freeport-McMoRan can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.Story continuesFreeport-McMoRan does come with some risks though, we found 2 warning signs in our investment analysis, and 1 of those is a bit concerning...While Freeport-McMoRan isn't earning the highest return, check out this free list of companies that are earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

And in our experience, buying the right stocks can give your wealth a significant boost. To wit, the PepsiCo share price has climbed 59% in five years, easily topping the market return of 38% (ignoring dividends). However, more recent returns haven't been as impressive as that, with the stock returning just 11% in the last year , including dividends .With that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies. View our latest analysis for PepsiCo To paraphrase Benjamin Graham: Over the short term the market is a voting machine, but over the long term it's a weighing machine. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Over half a decade, PepsiCo managed to grow its earnings per share at 7.4% a year. This EPS growth is lower than the 10% average annual increase in the share price. So it's fair to assume the market has a higher opinion of the business than it did five years ago. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.The image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that PepsiCo has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This free report showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, PepsiCo's TSR for the last 5 years was 84%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveIt's nice to see that PepsiCo shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 11% over the last year. Of course, that includes the dividend. However, the TSR over five years, coming in at 13% per year, is even more impressive. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

(PEP): Here is What You Need to Know",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investors-heavily-search-pepsico-inc-130001807.html,1667394001,STORY,['PEP'],"[PepsiCo (PEP) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.Shares of this food and beverage company have returned +8.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +7.7% change. The Zacks Beverages - Soft drinks industry, to which PepsiCo belongs, has gained 9.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.PepsiCo is expected to post earnings of $1.64 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +7.2%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.1%.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.76 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +8%. This estimate has changed +1.4% over the last 30 days.For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.25 indicates a change of +7.2% from what PepsiCo is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.3%.Story continuesHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, PepsiCo is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for PEP _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For PepsiCo, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $26.74 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +5.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $85.13 billion and $87.79 billion estimates indicate +7.1% and +3.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryPepsiCo reported revenues of $21.97 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.8%. EPS of $1.97 for the same period compares with $1.79 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $20.88 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +5.24%. The EPS surprise was +6.49%.Over the last four quarters, PepsiCo surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.PepsiCo is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about PepsiCo. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

diverse blood cancers and rare blood disorders.Our blood cancer research is focused on bispecific antibodies that are being investigated both as monotherapies and in combination with each other and emerging therapeutic modalities. Together, they provide us with unique combinatorial flexibility to develop customized and potentially synergistic cancer treatments.Our research and collaborations to develop potential treatments for rare blood disorders include explorations in antibody medicine, gene editing and gene-knockout technologies, and investigational RNA-approaches focused on depleting abnormal proteins or blocking disease-causing cellular signaling.If you are interested in learning more about our clinical trials, please contact us (clinicaltrials@regeneron.com or 844-734-6643) or visit our clinical trials website.About Regeneron's VelocImmune TechnologyRegeneron's VelocImmune® technology utilizes a proprietary genetically engineered mouse platform endowed with a genetically humanized immune system to produce optimized fully human antibodies. When Regeneron's co-Founder, President and Chief Scientific Officer George D. Yancopoulos was a graduate student with his mentor Frederick W. Alt. in 1985, they were the first to envision making such a genetically humanized mouse, and Regeneron has spent decades inventing and developing VelocImmune and related VelociSuite® technologies. Dr. Yancopoulos and his team have used VelocImmune technology to create approximately one in five of all original, FDA-approved or authorized fully human monoclonal antibodies.

This compares to earnings of $15.37 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 14.85%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this biopharmaceutical company would post earnings of $8.53 per share when it actually produced earnings of $9.77, delivering a surprise of 14.54%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Regeneron , which belongs to the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry, posted revenues of $2.94 billion for the quarter ended September 2022, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 5.08%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $3.45 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.The sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.Regeneron shares have added about 17.3% since the beginning of the year versus the S&amp;P 500's decline of -21.1%.What's Next for Regeneron?While Regeneron has outperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?There are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Regeneron: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future.

The results are expected to be released on November 8.This medical technology company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.24 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -700%.

These non-GAAP financial measures are computed by excluding certain non-cash and/or other items from the related GAAP financial measure. The Company also includes a non-GAAP adjustment for the estimated income tax effect of reconciling items. A reconciliation of the Company's GAAP to non-GAAP results is included in Table 3 of this press release.The Company makes such adjustments for items the Company does not view as useful in evaluating its operating performance. For example, adjustments may be made for items that fluctuate from period to period based on factors that are not within the Company's control (such as the Company's stock price on the dates share-based grants are issued or changes in the fair value of the Company's investments in equity securities) or items that are not associated with normal, recurring operations (such as restructuring- or integration-related expenses). Management uses these non-GAAP measures for planning, budgeting, forecasting, assessing historical performance, and making financial and operational decisions, and also provides forecasts to investors on this basis. With respect to free cash flows, the Company believes that this non-GAAP measure provides a further measure of the Company's operations' ability to generate cash flows. Additionally, such non-GAAP measures provide investors with an enhanced understanding of the financial performance of the Company's core business operations. However, there are limitations in the use of these and other non-GAAP financial measures as they exclude certain expenses that are recurring in nature. Furthermore, the Company's non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable with non-GAAP information provided by other companies. Any non-GAAP financial measure presented by Regeneron should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.(b)The casirivimab and imdevimab antibody cocktail is known as REGEN-COV in the United States and Ronapreve in other countries. The Company records net product sales of REGEN-COV in the United States and Roche records net product sales of Ronapreve outside the United States. (c)The Company's collaborators provide it with estimates of the collaborators' respective sales and the Company's share of the profits or losses (if applicable) from commercialization of products for the most recent fiscal quarter. These estimates are revised, if necessary, in subsequent periods if the Company's actual share of the profits or losses differ from those estimates. SOURCE Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.]"

While some companies like Merck, Biogen, Sanofi and Gilead beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate on both counts, a few drug/biotech companies like AbbVie and Novartis reported mixed results.Some companies like Merck and Sanofi raised their sales and earnings expectations for the year while others kept their financial outlook intact as their expectations for better operational growth are likely to be offset by potentially greater currency headwinds.Per the Zacks classification, the pharma/biotech industry comes under the broader Medical sector, which comprises pharma/biotech as well as medical device companies.As of Oct 26, per the Earnings Trends report, 23.2% of the Medical sector participants, constituting 43% of the sector’s market capitalization, have already reported earnings.

These valuations are also supported by market research. For instance, a research report from Reports and Insights believes that the e-commerce market will grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.9% from 2022 to 2030, and from its current value of $48 billion to a massive $117.7 billion by the end of the forecast period. The report outlines that machine learning, cloud computing, and 3G and 4G connectivity will drive this growth - as sellers use the advanced technologies to optimize their customer offerings and the connectivity platforms enable more people to connect to the Internet.Another report, this time from Spherical Insights, places an even more optimistic CAGR of 14.3% on the e-commerce sector. It wagers that the industry was worth $810 billion last year and will grow through the aforementioned CAGR to sit at a whopping $1.9 trillion by the end of 2030. Some of the latest trends in the sector, according to the firm, are companies offering novel experiences such as streaming and gaming on their platform, combined with artificial intelligence and voice search to improve cataloging.Today's piece will focus on the largest American e-commerce companies, with the top picks being Amazon.com, Inc.

Second, 2022 is likely to be our third year of existence as a fund to lose money for the year. This year would join 2008 and 2018 in this undistinguished category.

Here is what the fund said:In terms of inflationary pressures, the vast majority of our holdings have been able to leverage strong market positions and stakeholder relationships to push pricing through in 2022 such that minimal impact to earnings has occurred. Clearly this is not a lever than can be pulled indefinitely but the more experienced management teams have kept some of their powder dry. Our meeting with management at Costco in Seattle was memorable for several reasons but one was their latent ability to increase member pricing which they have not done in over 5 years (and thus likely to do in 2023)……To conclude we’ll return to our meeting with Costco mentioned earlier. The business quality is no secret after decades of incredible execution, but the meeting gave us renewed conviction around Value Latencies in terms of the runway for growth, the focus on enhancing customer value, Costco’s vast buying power (it purchases 30% of the world’s jumbo cashews as one example) and management’s feral focus on the business model and cost discipline.”Along with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Walmart Inc.

It celebrates the diverse cultures and contributions of people whose ancestors came from Spain, Mexico, the Caribbean, Central and South America.This year's Hispanic &amp; Latinx Heritage Month theme at Cisco is Innovating with an Accent. It is important to understand and embrace the diversity within the Hispanic and Latinx communities, celebrate the impactful contributions of Hispanic and Latinx individuals, and support representation so we can continue to build a better future.Cisco is committed to building an inclusive future for all, including supporting our Hispanic and Latinx employees. We have an Employee Resource Organization (ERO) called Conexión, which is open to everyone and welcomes a multitude of cultural backgrounds. Conexión brings people together to experience personal and professional growth through inspirational leadership, coaching, mentoring, and by providing plentiful opportunities to give back.Learn more from members of Conexión about what Hispanic &amp; Latinx Heritage Month means to them.Vanessa de OliveiraDiversity, Inclusion &amp; Collaboration Program Lead""Putting identity generalizations and other situations aside, Hispanic &amp; Latinx Heritage Month to me represent two main things:First, it is a great opportunity to educate allies about a growing demographic that has long been relegated to the margins of history. This includes providing a chance to hear a narrative informed by culture. After all, as the artist Resident said; ‘América no es solo U.S.A., papa' (English translation: America is not just the U.S.A.).The second one is the chance to celebrate Latinx cultural icons to coalesce our community, call forth successful historical struggles, and activate change.Unlike many Brazilians I know, I always felt Latina and even after I migrated, I felt this identity even stronger. When you move to a new country and you must build a new support network from scratch, friends quickly become your family. It was in Latinx community, and by joining our ERO Conexión, that I found a great part of my emotional support. To reference to the Uruguayan Author Eduardo Galeano, ‘Yes, indeed: however, hurt and shattered one might be, one can always find a contemporary anywhere in time and a compatriot anywhere in space. And wherever this happens, and for as long as it lasts, one is lucky to feel one is something in the infinite loneliness of the universe: something more than a ridiculous speck of dust, more than a fleeting moment.'Story continuesSo, for me, this is what Hispanic and Latinx Heritage Month is all about:Representation, identity, resistance, and justice. But it's also about connections, dances, rhythms, religions, flavors, and spices. It's about black coffee with no sugar, it's about colors.""Alberto ZarateLeader - Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Business Enablement""I joined Cisco in 2019, and I had been working in large multinational companies for five years before joining. Here is where I started celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month (HHM). You see, I live in Costa Rica, born and raised. I live and breathe Latinx culture every single day.However, in every single one of the companies I worked before, I always tried to hide my accent. I had to tone down that culture, yes, the one that made me who I am. Therefore, when I joined Cisco and I was told you can be you with us, I was surprised.When I joined Conexión and was told to be proud of my accent, I was amazed. When every single leader that I have had during my time here saw the benefits and worth of having someone born, raised, and located in Central America and never as a disadvantage to my career, but instead celebrated and gave new opportunities to continue growing, I was beyond happy.And that is what HHM means to me, a month when we celebrate Latinx culture and Latinx individuals who are spread all over the world. Amazing, talented, and beautiful human beings who regardless of where we sit, we celebrate our history, our culture, and our accent. We celebrate the impact and the accomplishments that we have had, we will continue having, and will continue achieving. And especially celebrating HHM at Cisco, where since day one, we are told to #BeYouWithUs and to always #BeProudOfOurAccent.""Deb PickeringLead, Human Resources Business Partner""As I reflect on Hispanic Heritage Month, who comes to mind is my grandfather, Professor Manuel Villavicencio Pérez or as we knew him ‘Méme'.He was a mathematician turned educator who founded the Instituto Latino Americano, in Cuernavaca, Morelos, México. A pre-school to high school by day and by night a teacher's college. His motto loosely translates into ‘educate the child today so that we don't punish the young man tomorrow (eduquemos al niño hoy, para no castigar al joven mañana)'. Education was his life and legacy.Like my grandfather's story, many Latin entrepreneurs are opening businesses, an anchor to the economy of the USA. According to a JP Morgan &amp; Chase article, Latin-owned businesses promise GDP growth, unlike any other sector. If these Latin-owned businesses only grow at the same rate as an average USA business, they will add 1.4 trillion dollars to the US economy. An economic powerhouse.What did hard work do for my family? My grandfather built a business that provided him and my grandmother the opportunity to travel the world, live a comfortable life, provide for their four children, and teach their grandchildren that hard work with dedication and passion is what we do.What can you do to become an ally or engage with your Latin or Hispanic peers? Join Conexión during the Hispanic Heritage Month celebrations. See us in action, join in on the fun, ask questions, and get proximate to our incredibly colorful and rich Latin and Hispanic cultures.How to take steps to allyshipThere are over 62 million people in the U.S who identify as Hispanic and Latinx, and they are one of the fastest growing populations, especially among youth. At the same time, Hispanic and Latinx individuals continue to experience racism and discrimination and are underrepresented in certain areas of the workforce, like science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM).Members of Hispanic &amp; Latinx communities could use your allyship, whether they be friends, family, or colleagues. Here are three ways to begin the process:Learn more about the issues Hispanic &amp; Latinx communities face through books, podcasts, or documentaries. Educating yourself on these topics can help you become more proximate to the lived experiences of people from different backgrounds.Consider donating to or volunteering with an organization that supports the advancement of equity and inclusion for Hispanic &amp; Latinx communities.Don't just show your support during Hispanic &amp; Latinx Heritage Month. Listen to, celebrate, and uplift voices from Hispanic &amp; Latinx communities all year.View original content here.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: http://csr.cisco.com/Email: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.View source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/723738/What-Hispanic-Latinx-Heritage-Month-Means-to-Members-of-Ciscos-Conexin]"

557,d45e8756-3eec-3113-ac6b-db702f496bee,CSCO,2022-11-03,Why Cisco (CSCO) Could Beat Earnings Estimates Again,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-cisco-csco-could-beat-161004444.html,1667405404,STORY,['CSCO'],"[Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Cisco Systems (CSCO), which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Networking industry.This seller of routers, switches, software and services has seen a nice streak of beating earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The average surprise for the last two quarters was 1.19%.For the most recent quarter, Cisco was expected to post earnings of $0.82 per share, but it reported $0.83 per share instead, representing a surprise of 1.22%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $0.86 per share, while it actually produced $0.87 per share, a surprise of 1.16%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Cisco, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Cisco has an Earnings ESP of +1.46% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on November 16, 2022.Story continuesInvestors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain. Additionally, some stocks may remain stable even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success.
