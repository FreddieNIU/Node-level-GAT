A closer look suggests a bearish rating for Robinhood and a neutral rating for Schwab.', 'Robinhood Markets operates a proprietary financial services platform that supports the trading of stocks, including fractional shares and cryptocurrencies. The platform also allows for other financial services like dividend reinvestments and access to initial public offerings.', 'Meanwhile, Charles Schwab is a savings-and-loan holding company that provides wealth management, securities brokerage, banking, asset management, custody, and financial advisory services.', 'Shares of Robinhood Markets have soared 51% year-to-date and are up 97% over the last year, while Charles Schwab stock is up a much more modest 4% year-to-date and has gained 48% over the last year.', 'With HOOD stock up much more than SCHW stock, it’s no surprise that there’s a sizable gap between their valuations. Although Robinhood management said in their fourth-quarter earnings release that they expect 2024 to be the first year of annual profitability, the company isn’t currently profitable.', 'Thus, we’ll compare the two companies’ price-to-sales (P/S) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and that of their industry. We’ll also look at Schwab’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. For comparison, the diversified financial industry is trading at a P/E of 17.1x versus its three-year average of 30.8x and a P/S of 3.8 versus its three-year average P/S of 2.7x.', 'At a P/S of 8.7x, Robinhood Markets is trading at a massive premium versus its industry and Schwab. With the stock right around overbought territory on a weekly time frame, a large volume of insider sales, and significant selling by a high-profile bull, a bearish view seems appropriate for now.', 'First, while Robinhood stock is up 106% over the last year, the majority of that rise has come since early February, with the stock skyrocketing from around $11 per share to nearly $20 in about two months. That rocket-ship ride initially lifted the shares into overbought territory. However, with the price coming down in the past few days, Robinhood’s relative strength index has retreated slightly, now just above 70 (with >70 being the threshold for overbought territory).', 'The recent fall calls attention to some signs of profit-taking in Robinhood stock. Longtime cryptocurrency bull Cathie Wood recently started dumping large volumes of Robinhood stock through her firm ARK Invest. On March 25, the firm unloaded 1.6 million shares from three funds, according to trade notifications.', 'Of that total, 1.25 million shares came from the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKK). This latest sale is the largest since the firm started loading up on Robinhood shares last year, and the timing suggests it could represent some profit-taking since it came after the stock nearly doubled in only two months’ time.', 'Insiders have also been selling Robinhood shares, with the large and growing number of Auto Sell transactions over the last two months also pointing to possible profit-taking among them. However, due to its high valuation and steep share-price increase in such a short period, the stock would have to fall significantly from current levels for me to consider a more constructive view.', 'Additionally, Robinhood’s direct exposure to cryptocurrency could become a problem if or when volatility returns to the crypto market. A key question is whether it can continue on its path toward profitability if the bottom falls out of the cryptocurrency-trading market.', 'Robinhood Markets has a Hold consensus rating based on four Buys, six Holds, and three Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $16.73, the average Robinhood Markets stock price target implies downside potential of 9.3%.', 'At a P/E of around 27.5x and a P/S of about 7x, Charles Schwab is trading at a sizable premium to its industry’s current valuation but a bit lower than its industry’s three-year average P/E. Schwab is not as overbought as Robinhood, but it’s teetering on the edge of overbought territory and starting to reverse course. Still, I’d like to see the price fall a bit further before becoming more constructive on the shares. Thus, a neutral view seems appropriate.', 'Currently, Schwab’s RSI stands at around 65, both on the daily and weekly time frame. Earlier this week, it was above 70 on the daily time frame. This shift suggests that the correction I’ve been waiting for may have just begun.', 'Schwab shares have been rising at a much more reasonable pace than Robinhood stock, although Schwab insiders have also been selling their shares lately. In fact, a notable shift from Auto Buy transactions about a month ago to mostly Auto Sell transactions a little less than a month ago coincided with a meaningful rise in Schwab shares from about $68 to $72.', 'However, there have been a couple of Informative Buy transactions from insiders within the last two weeks, as they fully exercised their options and kept their shares. This suggests that insiders like where the company is right now, which is a bullish sign for Charles Schwab in the long term. In fact, the company recently guided for a 5% to 6% sequential increase in revenue growth for the first quarter, which is an excellent sign.', 'Additionally, Schwab’s long-term gains of 72% over the last five years and 213% over the last 10 provide further evidence that this stock would be an excellent buy-and-hold candidate. However, given that we’re just seeing the beginning of the expected correction after the stock reached overbought territory, I’d probably wait and monitor Schwab stock as it falls to a more attractive price.', 'Charles Schwab has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on nine Buys, five Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $74.07, the average Charles Schwab stock price target implies upside potential of 3.8%.', 'As both Robinhood and Charles Schwab start to tumble back out of overbought territory on the heels of significant profit-taking in their shares, it’s beginning to look like the corrections normally expected after stocks become overbought have begun. However, Schwab is the winner of this pairing based on insider activity, long- and short-term share-price trends, and the potential for steady share-price appreciation with less volatility compared to Robinhood.', 'On the other hand, Robinhood could see some positive catalysts as it gradually becomes profitable in 2024. Regardless, at current levels, the stock is essentially priced for perfection, so any temporary wobble on the path to this year’s promised profitability could trigger a nasty sell-off.', 'In fact, Robinhood’s direct exposure to cryptocurrency trading could become an issue in the event of another major crypto sell-off. Thus, it’s good news for Schwab shareholders that the company doesn’t allow cryptocurrency trading.', 'Disclosure']"

I will now turn the call over to Neil Ashe.', 'Neil Ashe: Thank you, Charlotte, and thank you all for joining us this morning. Our fiscal 2024 second quarter was another quarter of solid execution. We increased our adjusted operating profit, adjusted operating profit margin and adjusted diluted earnings per share. We generated strong free cash flow, and we allocated capital effectively to drive value. Both our lighting and our intelligent spaces businesses delivered strong financial performance. In ABL, we increased adjusted operating profit by $3 million on $47 million less sales and increased the adjusted operating profit margin 120 basis points to 16.2%. This performance is is the cumulative result of the changes that we have made to the business over the last four years.', 'We have made the business more predictable, repeatable and scalable by executing on our strategy to increase product vitality, elevate service levels, use technology to improve and differentiate both our products and how we operate the business and by driving productivity. During the second quarter, we continue to make progress on our strategy. By focusing on the needs of our customers, we are elevating our service through our differentiated portfolios. Contractor Select is about 300 of our most popular products that are used in common everyday lighting applications. These products are designed to be resold and are in stock at retailers and electrical distributors. Through high levels of product vitality, we have been able to create a portfolio that offers quality products that our customers want at competitive prices, while at the same time, allowing our distributor partners to carry less inventory.', 'Design Select is comprised of products that are configurable and allow customers to easily select the products needed for their projects. We are less than a year into launching the first wave of Design Select, and we are continuing to expand the product families and configurations available. The reception so far has been positive. A recent project in California is a great example, where a customer needed indoor fixtures, outdoor fixtures and lighting controls. Using options from the Design Select portfolio, we were able to meet the unique product combination of the project, ensure it was there when the customer needed it, and then it was easy for the contractor to install. The remainder of our product portfolio is made to order. These are specialty products or solutions made for specific applications, such as national accounts that satisfy all of the wants and needs of the Lyon design community.', 'At the same time, we continue to make investments for future growth. In the second quarter, we expanded our horticulture product solutions. We add the Arize family of products to our existing Verjure line in order to take advantage of a growing market. Arize is a collection of professional grade LED horticulture luminaires, that are compatible with our in-line air wireless controls and are used in commercial greenhouses, indoor cultivation and vertical farming. This small investment accelerates our product portfolio efforts in this attractive vertical. This approach to investment in ABL is the right one, as evidenced by the value being realized in our OPTOTRONIC driver and component business. We acquired OPTOTRONIC in 2021 in order to control more of the technology in our luminaires to expand our OEM channel and to take greater control of our electronic supply chain.', 'Today, we are one of the top driver suppliers to the lighting industry and to ourselves as we manufacture the majority of our drivers for our own products. This control not only offers us a financial benefit but also offers us greater engineering flexibility during the design and development process that is core to our product vitality efforts. This quarter, we introduced the IVO family of shallow recessed downlights from Gotham which is a new platform from a vendor downlights that have a compact design for use in confined spaces that replace the traditional canned recess lighting fixtures. IVO can be used in most nonresidential settings in both new construction and renovation. The compact design and high efficiency options deliver real value for our customers, while the use of less steel, less aluminum and less plastic drives margin for us.', 'Finally, this quarter, several of our brands were recognized by the industry. Our Aculux, Eureka, Hydrel, Luminis and Peerless brands were awarded 9 good design awards from the Chicago Athenaeum Museum of Architecture and Design. We were awarded 11, 2023 product innovation awards by Architectural Products Magazine for impressive innovation in terms of form, functionality and sustainability. And 14 of our luminaires were selected across multiple product categories by the lift design awards for exemplifying outstanding creativity and innovation. Now moving to our Intelligence Spaces Group. Our mission in our Intelligence Spaces business is to make spaces smarter, safer and greener through our strategy of connecting the edge to the cloud. Distech has the best edge control devices on the market, while Atrius will be the best in cloud applications.', 'At Distech, we are focused on expanding our addressable market in 2 ways. The first is geographic and the second is increasing what we can control in a build space. As part of our geographic expansion, this quarter we added additional systems integrator capacity in Australia, and we released Atrius Sustainability and Atrius Energy in France. Our independent SIs are key to the organic expansion of our spaces business. We partner with the best SIs in specific geographies to sell our full suite of Distech and Atrius product portfolios. Our Atrius applications are making a difference for our customers. Atrius sustainability is an automation tool that captures, categorizes and reports on carbon emissions, while Atrius Energy facilitates the reduction of energy and carbon usage by allowing facilities teams to benchmark their usage and prepare for upcoming reporting obligations.', 'Our Atrius energy and sustainability applications are gaining recognition. Commercial Property Executive magazine named Atrius and innovative technology winner in its annual influence awards. And CRE tech selected Atrius as a finalist in its real estate tech awards that on our technology vendors that are advancing solutions for commercial buildings. Now turning to the outlook for the remainder of the year. We are performing well. We are satisfying customers, expanding margins and generating strong free cash flow. The order rates in both our Lighting business and our Spaces business are growing year-over-year. In our lighting business, we are back to typical lead times and absent the impact of sales from excess backlog last year, we would be experiencing sales growth.', 'In our lighting and lighting controls business, our strategy drives strong execution, and we are focused on returning the business to growth in a normalized environment, while leveraging our fixed costs and generating strong cash flow. In our Spaces business, we will continue to grow geographically and by adding to what we can control in a build space. Karen will outline what that means for our second half outlook after giving you an update on our second quarter performance. Karen?', 'Karen Holcom: Thank you, Neil, and good morning to everyone on the call. As Neil said, we continue to execute well. In our fiscal second quarter, we increased our adjusted operating profit, improved our adjusted operating profit margin and increased our adjusted diluted earnings per share while generating strong cash flow. We continue to allocate capital effectively while making progress on our strategic priorities. For total AYI, we generated net sales in the second quarter of $906 million, which was $38 million or 4% lower than the prior year as a result of the lower net sales in our ABL business. This was partially offset by continued growth in the ISG business of 17% in the quarter. We continue to deliver year-over-year margin improvement.', 'During the quarter, our adjusted operating profit increased by $8 million on lower net sales, and we expanded adjusted operating profit margin to 15.5% an increase of approximately 150 basis points from the prior year. This increase was driven largely by the significant year-over-year improvement in our gross profit margin as we continue to execute our strategy and drive margins through product vitality, the management of price and cost and productivity improvements. During the quarter, our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.38 increased $0.32 or 11% over the prior year, primarily a result of higher net income and to a lesser extent, lower shares outstanding due to share repurchases. In ABL, net sales were $844 million in the quarter.', ""A decrease of around 5% compared with the prior year, driven by declines across all of our channels. As Neil mentioned previously, our order rate in ABL continues to grow year-over-year meaning absent the sales last year from the excess backlog, ABL would have experienced sales growth. ABL's adjusted operating profit increased 2% to $136 million on lower net sales. While we delivered adjusted operating profit margin of 16.2%, a 120 basis point improvement over the prior year. ISG's net sales for the second quarter were $68 million, an increase of 17% as Distech continued to grow and KE2 Therm performed as we expected. ISG's adjusted operating profit was $14 million with the adjusted operating profit margin at 21%, a 240 basis point improvement over the prior year."", 'Now turning to our year-to-date cash flow performance. We generated $293 million of cash flow from operating activities in the first half of the year, down slightly from the same period last year. We continue to allocate capital consistent with our priorities. Year-to-date, we invested $29 million in capital expenditures. We acquired the assets of Arize Horticulture Lighting, we increased our dividend per share 15% and allocated approximately $68 million to repurchase over 370,000 shares. In January, our Board of Directors authorized the additional repurchase of up to 3 million shares of common stock, bringing the outstanding authorization to approximately 4 million shares. Since the beginning of the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020, we have repurchased approximately 9.5 million shares at an average price of about $145 per share, which was funded by organic cash flow.', 'This amounts to about 24% of the then shares outstanding. We had a strong first half performance. We delivered improved margins and increased adjusted diluted earnings per share. We generated strong cash flow from operations and continue to allocate capital effectively. While it is not our practice to address our outlook during the year, our performance in the first half was very strong and we are raising our full year expectations for EPS. We now expect our 2024 adjusted diluted earnings per share range to be between $14.75 and $15.50. Thank you for joining us today. I will now pass you over to the operator to take your questions.', 'See also Top 10 Alternatives to Aflac and 12 Dirt Cheap Stocks To Buy According to Hedge Funds.', 'To continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.']"

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, Thermo Fisher is expected to post earnings of $4.71 per share, indicating a change of -6.4% from the year-ago quarter.

Banks pushed back against these rules, arguing they are well capitalized, and further capital requirements could limit them and their ability to lend to their customers.', 'U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB) was one bank facing big questions because of these rule changes. However, the bank got some good news a couple of weeks ago when Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said there would be ""broad and material"" changes to proposed Basel III rules. Here\'s why the changes matter and why U.S. Bancorp could be a no-brainer buy for investors today.', ""The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision was established in 1974 and aims to improve stability by improving banking oversight. Following the global financial crisis in 2008, the Basel Committee established measures called Basel III. The measures looked to strengthen regulations and supervision over banks. These regulations assess a bank's risk and capital ratios to ensure it can withstand economic downturns."", 'The most recent set of proposed rules in the U.S. is called the Basel III ""endgame."" In July 2023, the Fed, the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. published the proposed changes that would align U.S. bank capital rules with Basel III standards. Some of the proposed changes include:', 'Lowering the threshold for banks facing the most stringent capital requirements to those with $100 billion in assets, down from the current threshold of $700 billion.', 'Require a standard measure of calculating capital requirements for loans.', 'Require banks to hold more capital for trading activities and operations risks.', ""U.S. Bancorp is already faced with rebuilding capital after acquiring MUFG Union Bank at the end of 2022. The acquisition expanded the bank's presence on the West Coast, but it was also a big drag on the bank's common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio."", ""The CET1 ratio measures the financial strength of the bank. It takes the bank's core capital as a percentage of its risk-weighted assets, like loans or investment securities. After acquiring Union Bank, U.S. Bancorp's CET1 ratio fell from 9.7% to 8.4%. For perspective, this was the lowest ratio among the 23 banks subjected to the Fed's annual stress test and well below the average ratio of 12.4%."", ""The acquisition increased U.S. Bancorp's assets to $675 billion. This matters because once a bank reaches $700 billion in assets, it becomes a Category II bank, subjecting it to more stringent capital requirements."", 'The Fed required the bank to submit quarterly implementation plans to comply with these requirements. However, last fall it released the bank from these commitments after the bank came up with a plan for ""further net reductions in assets and increases in regulatory capital.""', ""Banks have pushed back firmly on the proposed endgame regulations put forward by the Fed last July. Those in the industry argued it would raise the cost of lending, push consumers outside the banking system, and inhibit banks' trading and other activities."", 'Numerous others joined banks in opposing the changes, including some unlikely allies. Consumer advocacy groups worry that the revisions would lead to reduced credit availability. They also argued that it could undercut homeownership and community reinvestment activities. Both Republican and Democratic representatives have also joined in opposing the proposed rule changes.', 'Last month, the Fed\'s Powell said, ""I do expect there will be broad material changes to the proposal,"" which ""has broad support at the Fed and in the broader world."" The revamped proposal will likely be presented by the end of this year, and should eliminate some of the risks of the more stringent capital requirements originally proposed.', 'U.S. Bancorp faced big question marks over its capital ratios after its acquisition of Union Bank. The bank is making progress on rebuilding its capital. At the end of last year, U.S. Bancorp improved its CET1 ratio to 9.9%, and its total assets remained steady at $663 billion.', ""The bank stock remains 23% below its all-time high price two years ago. The stock has gained 37% during the past six months, so it's not quite the bargain it was back in November. However, the bank is priced at 13 times earnings and 2.3 times tangible book value, both below its 10-year averages."", 'Although the bank still has to work to improve its capital ratios further, it looks like it will be spared from the more stringent capital requirements as long as its assets remain below the $700 billion threshold. Analysts at Compass Point said that U.S. Bancorp has the potential for greater capital relief compared to its peers thanks to the pending changes to Basel III and that its capital overhang is ""greatly diminished.""', 'U.S. Bancorp has historically traded at a premium to peers thanks to its solid return on equity. Now that some of the more stringent capital requirements appear to be off the table, today could be an excellent time to scoop up shares of the bank stock.', 'Before you buy stock in U.S. Bancorp, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and U.S. Bancorp wasn’t one of them.

Further, a turnaround in the capital markets business, especially investment banking, will support the company’s financials.Analysts are also bullish on the stock’s earnings growth prospects. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings for both fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2025 has moved almost 1% north. RJF currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).Over the past three months, shares of Raymond James have rallied 15.6%, outperforming the industry’s growth of 8.3%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Here are a few factors that make RJF an attractive investment option now.Earnings Growth: Raymond James has witnessed earnings growth of 17.6% in the past three to five years, driven by a solid top-line performance and strategic buyouts. The number is also impressive compared with the industry’s average of 7.1%.With the operating backdrop turning favorable for investment banks, the company’s earnings are expected to continue the upward momentum. Hence, we expect earnings to grow at the rate of 6.2%, 2.9% and 11.1% in fiscal 2024, fiscal 2025 and fiscal 2026, respectively.Revenue Strength: Raymond James remains focused on enhancing revenue growth. The company’s net revenues witnessed a CAGR of 9.8% in the last five fiscal years (2018-2023), primarily due to a rise in asset management and related administrative fees and decent capital markets performance.Further, the company has been expanding through acquisitions, which also support its top-line growth. Our estimate for total net revenues implies a CAGR of 6% by fiscal 2026.Synergies From Opportunistic Buyouts: Raymond James has undertaken several strategic expansion plans over the past few years, driven by its strong liquidity and balance sheet positions. This has also helped the company expand internationally, mainly in Europe and Canada.In September 2023, RJF acquired Canada-based Solus Trust Company Limited. In fiscal 2022, the company acquired SumRidge Partners, TriState Capital Holdings and the U.K.-based Charles Stanley Group PLC. These deals, along with several past ones, poise RJF well for future growth. Management looks forward to actively growing through acquisitions with an aim to further strengthen the Private Client Group and Asset Management segments.Strong Balance Sheet: As of Dec 31, 2023, Raymond James had a total debt of $3.14 billion and cash and cash equivalents worth $10.2 billion. Given the investment-grade ratings and stable outlook from rating agencies, as well as solid earnings strength, there is less likelihood of the company defaulting on its debt obligations even if the economic situation worsens.Steady Capital Distributions: Raymond James has a track record of regularly raising dividends over the last decade. The last dividend hike of 7.1% was announced in November 2023. In the same month, the company authorized the repurchase of shares worth up to $1.5 billion. As of Jan 24, 2024, $1.39 billion remained under the buyback authorization.Given a robust capital position and lower dividend payout ratio compared with peers, the company is expected to continue efficient capital distributions, thereby enhancing shareholder value.Superior Return on Equity (ROE): Raymond James’ trailing 12-month ROE reflects its superiority in terms of utilizing shareholders’ funds. The company’s ROE of 17.95% compares favorably with 10.81% of the industry.', 'A couple of other stocks from the investment management space worth a look are Interactive Brokers IBKR and Stifel Financial SF.

It’s You, Not the Data', 'Stocks Drop After Fed Officials Cast Doubt on Rate Cuts', 'Elon Musk Boosts AI Engineer Pay in ‘Craziest Talent War’', 'They do, however, own valuable real estate, well-recognized names and wide customer bases—things that investors without the glare of quarter-to-quarter scrutiny think they can squeeze more value out of.', 'Macy’s and Nordstrom are the subject of such take-privates right now. Real-estate-focused investor Arkhouse and its partner Brigade Capital are doing due diligence to see exactly how much they might offer to buy the shares they don’t already own of Macy’s. And Nordstrom’s founding family is said to be considering a take-private.', 'Markets aren’t quite convinced these deals will materialize: Macy’s shares are changing hands at about $18 a share, well below the $24 that Arkhouse and Brigade offered. The prospective buyers even said they may raise that offer if they like what they see during due diligence. Nordstrom’s shares rose as much 18% in the days following Reuters’ report that the Nordstrom family is considering a take-private. The company’s stock is now up 6.7% compared with where it was before that report.', 'Some skepticism is warranted. Both targets were the subject of such take-private efforts in 2017, and neither succeeded because investors had difficulty lining up financing. Interest rates today are much less favorable.', 'One thing potential acquirers do have working for them, though, is just how cheap department stores are today. Shares of Macy’s and Nordstrom trade around a fifth of their respective forward-12-month revenues, while Kohl’s shares are valued at about a sixth of its forward revenues. Back in 2017, Macy’s shares were valued at about a third of forward-12-month revenues on average, while Nordstrom was commanding about a half of its forward-12-month revenues.', 'Since 2010, revenue at listed department stores—Kohl’s, Nordstrom, Macy’s and Dillard’s—has lagged behind inflation, collectively growing at an average compound annual growth rate of 0.4%. Sales at off-price retailers TJX Companies, Burlington Stores and Ross Stores, meanwhile, have eaten their lunch with average growth of 7.4% since 2010. Over the last decade, shares of Macy’s and Nordstrom have lost about 70% of their value.', 'Is there even a public investment case for department stores? Many industry analysts say the business is in secular decline, losing share to off-price retailers such as T.J. Maxx and Burlington Stores, e-commerce and the apparel brands themselves, many of which have shifted to bypassing department stores in favor of direct sales. Yet miracles have happened in retail: Think Best Buy under Hubert Joly or Brian Cornell’s turnaround at Target.', 'But visionary leaders don’t grow on trees, and radical makeovers have a patchy history at department stores. Apple Store alum Ron Johnson’s disastrous 17 months trying to reinvent JC Penney is the most infamous. What the tired category needs isn’t a renaissance so much as a clear-eyed plan to return cash to shareholders—something that private-equity-type owners might find easier to do.', 'Being a public company shouldn’t prevent such a strategy, though. Regional department store chain Dillard’s is a case in point. The company stands out from national giants for many reasons, including its loyal customer and employee base, a pristine balance sheet (the only chain with net cash) and no quarterly earnings calls. But the metric that really sticks out is how much it spends on buybacks and dividends rather than reinvesting in its business.', 'Over the past decade, Dillard’s spent 2.5 times more on shareholder returns than on capital expenditures. Macy’s and Kohl’s spent 51% and 34% more on shareholder returns, respectively, than capex, while Nordstrom has spent more on investments than shareholder returns. Markets clearly like Dillard’s model: Its shares trade at roughly 1.1 times forward-12-month revenue when other department stocks are being valued closer to 0.2 times.', 'And then there is also the age-old question of how best to squeeze value out of department stores’ real estate. Neil Saunders, managing director at GlobalData, estimated that Macy’s real-estate portfolio is worth at least $6 billion (its market value and debt combined are about $10.4 billion). But “unlocking the value of real estate” as investors would say, is easier said than done.', 'As James Cook, senior director of Americas retail research at JLL, puts it: “It’s as if I had a coin collection worth $1 million, but to unlock the value of it I’d need to take each pile of coins to its country of origin to negotiate the sale.” In other words, it takes many years and real-estate expertise to extract the full value.', 'Sears spun off its Sears and Kmart real-estate portfolio, comprising 235 locations, into another listed company called Seritage Growth Properties in 2015. About eight years in, the real-estate-holding company is still selling off property: It held 32 properties as of Dec. 31, 2023, and plans to sell all of it before distributing the proceeds to shareholders and dissolving itself. The Sears retail operation itself went bankrupt in 2018 and has closed most of its stores.', 'Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson’s Bay, which went private in 2020, has taken a more creative approach. It has turned parts of its department-store footprint into co-working spaces with WeWork in a venture they call SaksWorks.', 'Paths to monetization don’t look as easy in today’s environment. A sale lease-back may be the fastest but comes with the least potential returns: After all, the tenants will be the same slow-growing department stores. Re-leasing gigantic stores as they are is difficult too because few other department stores are looking to expand, notes Cook. This means it will likely require carving space into smaller boxes. Transforming stores into something else, such as offices, won’t be easy to do immediately given how challenging it is to raise construction loans.', 'If given the chance, maybe shareholders should just take the money and run.', 'Write to Jinjoo Lee at jinjoo.lee@wsj.com', 'Amazon Sellers Plagued by Surge in Scam Returns', 'Oil Is Hitting Its Highest Level in Months—Just in Time for Summer Driving Season', 'The British Are Coming for Your White-Collar Job', 'British Billionaire Joe Lewis Avoids Prison Time in U.S. Insider-Trading Case', 'A Tiny Activist Fund Is Trying to Unseat Larry Fink']"

They played an important role in the history of American retail and urbanization, and prior to department stores, retailers tended to sell narrow specialty and niche items.

Undoubtedly, when basic costs of living (think housing and food) are at ground zero of the inflationary boom, it can be tough to save up for that getaway experience, whether it be a cruise or a simple trip out to Las Vegas.', 'As easy as it is to delay such vacation experiences, I think that the end of inflation (or at least the beginning of the end) could mark the start of a return to leisure.', 'Various parts of the economy are still holding up quite well (there is still no recession in the books). And though we’re certainly not out of the woods quite yet, as certain Federal Reserve members contemplate fewer rate hikes due to a robust U.S. economy, one can’t help but imagine consumers finding a way to chug along. They’re beginning to be more selective with how they spend their discretionary cash.', 'In any case, let’s harness the power of TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to tune into three leisure stocks highly favored by Wall Street right now.', 'Royal Caribbean Cruise stock has been cruising higher over the past year, leaving its industry rivals to tread water. At writing, RCL stock is flirting with new all-time highs after surging more than 300% from the dark depths of 2022.', 'While Royal Caribbean has been enjoying the ascent, its peers are still struggling to sustain any sort of positive momentum. Just have a look at the stock charts of the major cruise lines and you’ll see the story that’s unfolding. Royal seems well-equipped to take market share over the foreseeable future.', 'Undoubtedly, the premier nature (it doesn’t get classier than Royal) of the firm’s cruise lines is paying off big-time as it cashes in on robust booking demand for the most leisurely of travels. With distinct advantages over peers (fabulous new ships, like Silver Nova, have been setting sail, with Utopia of the Seas to do so this summer) and no signs of demand reversal, I have to stay bullish on RCL stock.', 'Why settle for an older ship at a lower price when you have profound innovations packed in the latest and greatest ships that offer unmatched experiences for those with a taste for luxury?', 'Royal Caribbean shows that sometimes you’ve got to spend money to make money. Not only that, but RCL could gain market share and have what it takes to pad its long-term margins as more cruisers look to crave (and pay up for) the very best.', 'RCL stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 10 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average RCL stock price target\xa0of $150.67 implies 11.6% upside potential.', 'For deep-value investors seeking to bet on the underdog, Carnival looks to be the more intriguing comeback play. Undoubtedly, the tides have been turned in favor of Royal Caribbean in recent quarters, but Carnival has been no slouch, with an impressive 53% gain posted over the past year.', 'At this juncture, it’s unclear how Carnival can gain share over its high-end rival. Perhaps a broadening out of a cruising bull market would benefit Carnival. In any case, I’m staying bullish on CCL stock, primarily due to the modest valuation and its favorable positioning with the budget-conscious family crowd.', 'Like Royal, Carnival has benefited from similar industry dynamics (record bookings and improving margins). And though Carnival has new ships (Carnival Jubilee) of its own to get cruisers excited and ready to book, it also has to balance fleet expansion investments with debt reduction plans. It’s a fine balance, but it’s one that could allow CCL stock to sail higher as the industry continues with its recovery.', 'One thing to note is that the Baltimore Bridge collapse is expected to hit adjusted earnings by $10 million. In any case, the disaster’s impact on the bottom line seems mostly baked in right here.', 'CCL stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 14 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average CCL stock price target\xa0of $22.75 implies 51.1% upside potential.', 'Apart from the cruisers, MGM Resorts looks like an intriguing option for investors looking to play a leisure stock comeback at a dirt-cheap multiple. At writing, shares of the iconic Vegas staple trade at just 14.9 times trailing price-to-earnings, well below the resorts & casinos industry average of 20.7 times. Just last week, Mizuho (NYSE:MFG) stepped forward, starting MGM stock with a Buy rating, saying the stock is undervalued.', 'Indeed, as consumer discretionary income bounces back, MGM is a prime candidate to benefit. As such, I’m staying bullish on the stock as we head into the summer months. “We see a compelling FCF and stock buyback value creation path, whereby MGM could theoretically buy $4-5 billion of stock over the next five years,” said Mizuho’s Ben Chaiken.', 'Undoubtedly, MGM may not be a growth darling, but it’s certainly a cash cow — one that could get fatter as demand for leisurely travel starts to pick up.', 'Given the rise in digital gaming, which allows gamblers to place bets from the comfort of their own homes, one can’t help but imagine that more people have developed an appetite for rolling the dice. That doesn’t just entail a rise in digital gaming but possibly more trips to Vegas. Either way, MGM stands out as a firm worth betting on as the economy heats up.', 'MGM stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 12 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average MGM stock price target\xa0of $56.46 implies 23.1% upside potential.', 'Leisure stocks may be ready to rip higher as the American economy continues exhibiting resilience. From the cruise lines to the Vegas icons, a strong U.S. economy can act as a huge tide that lifts all ships in the scene. Of the trio of Strong Buys, Wall Street seems to like CCL stock the most, with ~51% in gains expected over the year ahead.', 'Disclosure']"

In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.', 'The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.', ""MGM has an Earnings ESP of +28.40% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on May 1, 2024."", 'Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric.', 'Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain.

This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well.

So we haven't really seen the prices accelerate at the pump too much, that's why those have been relatively quiet. But if energy prices stay high, the Fed, on one hand, they want to ignore-- on the PCE they want the core deflator, which excludes volatile food and energy.

MSI recently announced that Oakland County has deployed Motorola P25 radio systems to improve public safety and emergency response services in the region. The state-of-the-art radio system allows Oakland County first responders to establish direct connections with 2,231 public safety agencies and 126 dispatch centers across the state.An investment of $61 million was allocated for acquiring more than 6,000 Motorola radios in a bid to replace legacy OpenSky radio systems. The previous radio infrastructure, operational since 2005, was plagued by various complexities, such as coverage gaps emerging shortly after crossing county lines and dead spots even within Oakland County itself.First responders often find themselves operating in hostile environments, where the absence of robust communication channels can result in significant consequences. Critical information lost due to inadequate communication systems can impede collaboration, resulting in heightened risks of accidents and delays in emergency response times. This necessitates an interoperable communication system enabling various agencies to communicate effectively during large-scale events.The Motorola P25 Radio System effectively tackles these challenges by bridging coverage gaps and enabling real-time communication on a daily basis. The upgraded system boasts advanced features, including a recording system that captures all radio traffic and an emergency GPS locator button that enhances the safety of officials in dangerous situations. The system also includes two extra channels to accommodate the increased communication needs, facilitating seamless cooperation among various agencies during large-scale emergencies.Moreover, it extends connectivity and offers uninterrupted radio coverage for first responders across the entire state. Owing to this attribute, first responders in Oakland County can maintain communication without encountering signal interruptions regardless of their location within the state.Unlike legacy communication systems, where dispatchers often had to manually establish temporary connections or ""patches"" between different radio channels or agencies. Motorola’s solution also eliminates this time-consuming, error-prone practice of setting up these temporary connections.These cutting-edge features significantly augment situational awareness of public safety teams, making P25 radio a suitable choice for mission-critical communication.As a leading provider of mission-critical communication products and services worldwide, Motorola has ensured a steady revenue stream from this niche market. The communications equipment maker intends to boost its position in the public safety domain by entering into strategic alliances with other players in the ecosystem. Motorola witnessed a healthy demand for video security products and services during the fourth quarter of 2023 and remains well poised to maintain this growth momentum with a diversified portfolio. The company’s emphasis on innovation and the creation of intelligent, data-driven public safety solutions is expected to bolster its future prospects.The stock has gained 22.4% over the past year compared with the industry’s rise of 17.1%.', 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Currently, Motorola carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).', 'Nokia Corporation NOK carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.

He helms Appaloosa Management -- the hedge fund he founded back in 1993. He has been called ""arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation"" and also consistently outperforms his peers.', ""He correctly predicted the collapse of the housing market and the resulting financial crisis that led to the Great Recession in 2008. He also loaded up on bank stocks at the depths of the downturn, a strategy that eventually turned a significant profit for Appaloosa investors. With a resume like that, it's no wonder that many investors follow his moves with keen interest."", 'It raised some eyebrows when Tepper significantly reduced his stakes in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) in the fourth quarter while opting to increase his stakes in two other members of the ""Magnificent Seven.""', ""In the fourth quarter, Tepper made some big changes to the upper echelons of Appaloosa's portfolio, cutting his stake in Nvidia by 23%. He obviously still sees upside in the stock, as the hedge fund still owns 790,000 shares worth an estimated $678 million). And Nvidia is still Appaloosa's fourth-largest holding at nearly 7% of the portfolio."", ""The sale was likely a calculated move on Tepper's part. After all, Nvidia gained 239% last year and was selling for 65 times earnings and 27 times sales, so its valuation was steep."", ""Tepper also slashed his stake in Alphabet stock by 16%, though it remains the fund's seventh-largest holding. Appaloosa now owns 2.3 million shares worth about $388 million."", ""In this case, though, there's no obvious catalyst explaining his decision to sell. The stock was still reasonably priced at year's end, trading for 24 times earnings. He may have had concerns about the timing of the rebound in the digital ad market -- which is responsible for the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue -- or questions about how AI will ultimately impact Google's near monopoly in search."", ""In moves that aren't too surprising, Tepper added to his existing stakes in two of Appaloosa's top three holdings, as he's apparently still bullish on their prospects."", ""Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) cemented its place as the hedge fund's No. 2 holding as Tepper increased his stake by 4%. This brought the total count to 1.7 million shares currently worth roughly $710 million, or 11.3% of Appaloosa's holdings. Microsoft arguably kick-started the AI revolution when it invested in Chat-GPT creator OpenAI and integrated generative AI capabilities across a broad cross-section of its workplace productivity tools."", 'The biggest opportunity, however, is likely Copilot, its AI-powered digital assistant. Microsoft debuted a number of job-specific versions of Copilot that help automate otherwise time-consuming tasks. The company gained cloud market share, the result of strong demand for its AI tools.', 'Microsoft stock was selling for a slight premium of 34 times sales at the end of the fourth quarter, but given its quick move into the AI marketplace and the potential for profits, that valuation is more than reasonable.', ""Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was the second of Tepper's Magnificent Seven purchases. He increased his holdings by 5%, bringing Appaloosa's total stake to 3.95 million shares. At their current value of about $711 million, they account for 11% of the portfolio. As the undisputed cloud infrastructure leader, Amazon has a captive audience for its AI products and services."", 'The company released a bevy of helpful tools on its e-commerce platform to streamline the processes of selling goods and buying advertising. Furthermore, Amazon has a long history of managing its online retail business in part with AI systems, which help it maintain adequate inventory levels, surface relevant recommendations, schedule more efficient delivery routes, and more.', 'And with the stock trading at less than 3 times sales at the end of the fourth quarter, Amazon was a steal.', ""So far, Tepper's results from these moves have been mixed. Nvidia stock gained 80% so far this year, which has kept it in its position as the undisputed champion among the Magnificent Seven. Alphabet stock is up 11%. Over the same period, Amazon and Microsoft have gained 20% and 12%, respectively. This suggests that Tepper would have been better off had he not made any changes at all to his allocations to these stocks."", ""There's a lesson here for investors. If the investing thesis for one of your holdings hasn't changed -- even if the stock sports a nosebleed valuation -- it's sometimes best to stay the course. The AI revolution has just started, and while competition is ramping up, Nvidia's AI processors are still the best in the business. And Alphabet has a long track record of successfully deploying AI algorithms to further its business objectives, and there's no evidence to suggest that this time will be any different."", 'Influential economist John Maynard Keynes reportedly said, ""Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent."" Applied to this case, I take that to mean it\'s best not to make investing decisions based on what the broader market is expected to do, but rather to focus on a company\'s prospects.', 'When our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

In its fourth quarter of 2024 (which ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The meteoric rise was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales."", ""Additionally, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, significantly higher than AMD's $1 billion and Intel's -$14 billion. So, despite new GPU releases from both competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed the company further ahead, providing it with more significant cash reserves to continue investing in technology and retain market supremacy."", ""Nvidia's price-to-free-cash-flow and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios plunged in the last year, indicating its stock is at one of its best-valued positions in 12 months."", 'Data by YCharts', ""P/E is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings per share.

What he found when he investigated has sent shudders across the software world and drawn attention from tech executives and government officials.', 'Freund, who works for Microsoft out of San Francisco, discovered that the latest version of the open source software program XZ Utils had been deliberately sabotaged by one of its developers, a move that could have carved out a secret door to millions of servers across the internet.', 'Security experts say it’s only because Freund spotted the change before the latest version of XZ had been widely deployed that the world was spared a digital security crisis.', '“We really dodged a bullet,” said Satnam Narang, a security researcher with Tenable who has been tracking the fallout from the find. “It is one of those moments where we have to wipe our brow and say, ‘We were really lucky with this one.’”', 'The near-miss has refocused attention on the safety of open source software – free, often volunteer-maintained programs whose transparency and flexibility mean they serve as the foundation for the internet economy.', 'Many such projects depend on a tiny circle of unpaid volunteers fighting to get out from under a pile of demands for fixes and upgrades.', 'XZ, a suite of file compression tools packaged into distributions of the Linux operating system, was long maintained by a single author, Lasse Collin.', 'In recent years, he appeared to be under strain.', 'In a message posted to a public mailing list in June 2022, Collin said he was dealing with ""longterm mental health issues"" and hinted that he working privately with a new developer named Jia Tan and that “perhaps he will have a bigger role in the future.”', 'Update logs available through the open source software site Github show that Tan’s role quickly expanded. By 2023 the logs show Tan was merging his code into XZ, a sign that he had won a trusted role in the project.', 'But cybersecurity experts who’ve scoured the logs say that Tan was masquerading as a helpful volunteer. Over the next few months, they say, Tan introduced a nearly invisible backdoor into XZ.', 'Collin didn’t return messages seeking comment and said on his website that he would not respond to reporters until he understood the situation well enough to do so.', ""Tan did not return messages sent to his Gmail account. Reuters has been unable to ascertain who Tan is, where he is, or who he was working for, but many of those who've examined his updates believe Tan is a pseudonym for an expert hacker or group of hackers -- likely one working on behalf of a powerful intelligence service."", '“This is not kindergarten stuff,” said Omkhar Arasaratnam, the general manager of the Open Source Security Foundation, which works to defend projects like XZ. “This is incredibly sophisticated.”', '‘WE LUCKED OUT’', 'Tan could easily have gotten away with it had it not been for Freund, the Microsoft developer, whose curiosity was piqued when he noticed the latest version of XZ intermittently using an unexpected amount of processing power on the system he was testing.', 'Microsoft declined to make Freund available for an interview, but in a publicly-available email and posts to social media, Freund said a series of easy-to-miss clues prompted him to discover the backdoor.', 'The find “really required a lot of coincidences,” Freund said on the social network Mastodon.', 'Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella congratulated Freund over the weekend, saying in a post to the social network X that he loved seeing how the developer, “with his curiosity and craftsmanship, was able to help us all.”', ""In the open source community, the discovery has been sobering. The volunteers who maintain the software that underpins the internet aren't strangers to the idea of little pay or recognition, but the realization that they were now being hunted by well-resourced spies pretending to be Good Samaritans was “incredibly intimidating,” said Arasaratnam, of the Open Source Security Foundation."", 'Government officials are also weighing the implications of the near-miss, which has underlined concerns about how to protect open source software. Assistant National Cyber Director Anjana Rajan told Politico that “there’s a lot of conversations that we need to have about what we do next” to protect open source code.""', 'The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) says it has been leaning on U.S. companies that use open source software to plow resources back into the communities that build and maintain it. CISA adviser Jack Cable told Reuters the burden was on tech companies not just to vet open software but to “contribute back and help build the sustainable open source ecosystem that we get so much value from.”', 'It’s not clear that software companies are properly incentivized to do so. Online open source mailing lists are teeming with complaints about tech giants demanding that volunteers troubleshoot issues with open source software those companies use to make billions of dollars.', 'Whatever the solution, almost everyone agrees the XZ episode shows something has to change.', ""“We got unreasonably lucky here,” said Freund in another Mastodon post. “We can't just bank on that going forward.”"", '(Reporting by Raphael Satter, Editing by Chris Sanders and Nick Zieminski)']"

These technology leaders are involved in some of today\'s hottest areas, from artificial intelligence (AI) to cloud computing services. And thanks to this, their names are highly recognizable: Amazon, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) make up this star-studded list.', ""Most of these market giants have continued to soar, led by Nvidia, which has gained 79% so far this year. That helped the S&P 500 rise more than 10% for its best first quarter in five years, and that's kept the Magnificent Seven in the spotlight in 2024. But two members of this elite group no longer are wowing investors, and instead, are in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. Let's take a closer look."", 'Which stocks am I talking about? Apple, the maker of world-famous products like the iPhone and Mac, and electric vehicle (EV) leader Tesla. These stocks have disappointed investors with their performance over the past few months, falling 11% and 32%, respectively, since the start of the year.', ""In fact, they even weighed negatively on the performance of the S&P 500 in the first quarter, together shaving 1.3 percentage points off the index's return, according to Statista. The chart below shows Apple's -7.1% contribution and Tesla's -5% contribution to the S&P 500's total return for the quarter. These two made the biggest negative contributions to the index."", ""A few reasons may be behind investors' decisions to turn their backs on shares of Apple and Tesla in the first quarter. Let's start with Apple. Yes, the company has grown earnings over time, and its products remain favorites worldwide. For example, Apple, for the first time, took the top seven positions in Counterpoint Research's list of best-selling smartphones in 2023."", ""But some fans still are waiting for the next big innovation from Apple. Though the company recently released its Apple Vision Pro spatial computer earlier this year, it's been met with mixed reviews. Apple also has been slower than other tech giants to detail its plans for AI. So, investors looking to bet on current and future high-growth players may turn away from Apple in favor of a company that offers a solid and clear path to growth over the next few years."", ""Now let's consider Tesla. The company last year made moves such as lowering the prices on certain vehicles to increase volume and cutting production costs, and this is positive. But at the same time, some of Tesla's current efforts are weighing on earnings, and the company also faces headwinds such as competition and negative currency impact."", 'Tesla shares also trade for 57x forward earnings estimates, making them the most expensive of all of the Magnificent Seven stocks by this measure. This clearly could hurt demand for the stock and spur investors to buy shares of cheaper Magnificent Seven players right now.', ""As mentioned above, Nvidia has posted the best performance of all of these companies and contributed the most to the S&P 500's increase so far this year. And for good reason. The tech giant delivered triple-digit gains in revenue and net income in the most recent quarter and just announced the upcoming launch of its much-anticipated Blackwell architecture and most powerful chips yet. Investors also are optimistic about the company due to its dominance in the AI chip market, especially considering forecasts that the AI market may surpass $1 trillion by the end of the decade."", ""Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon -- the other top contributors to the S&P 500's first quarter gain -- also are investing heavily in AI. So, investors in the first few months of the year clearly have been aiming to get in on potential AI winners."", 'Does this mean the party is over for Apple and Tesla (and their shareholders)? Not necessarily. The long-term picture remains bright for both of these market leaders.', ""Apple's solid moat -- its brand strength -- should ensure its products' dominance in their markets, and the company's next growth engine may be its services business. Tesla remains the EV leader in the U.S. and is developing the technologies today that could help it stand out over time -- and maintain this leadership."", 'All of this means that, even though Apple and Tesla are standing in the spotlight today for all the wrong reasons, they -- and their investors -- still could score a major win over the long term.', 'Before you buy stock in Apple, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Well, actually, it was more like a shave. He reduced it by $2 to $35 per share. Given that the latter is 89% higher than Walgreens's most recent closing stock price, it nearly goes without saying that he maintained his existing buy recommendation on the company."", ""Rhyee's adjustment came mere days after the pharmacy company unveiled its second quarter of fiscal 2024 results. It managed to grow both revenue and non-GAAP (adjusted) profitability, and as a bonus, both line items came in notably above the consensus analyst estimates."", 'Not all was sunshine and roses for Walgreens, however. The company lopped off the top end of its adjusted net income guidance for the entirety of fiscal 2024; it now stands at $3.20 to $3.35 per share, where formerly the range was $3.20 to $3.50.', ""Walgreens certainly looks inexpensive based on some of its valuations. For example, its price to sales ratio is 0.1, while its forward price to earnings ratio is a shade over 6.

This is why loading up on dividend stocks after they have slumped, provided their businesses are still in good shape, can be a great move for long-term investors. "", ""Three stocks that are not only paying high yields but are also trading near their 52-week lows today are Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX), BCE (NYSE: BCE), and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD). Here's why investing $5,000 into these stocks could make a lot of sense for income investors right now."", 'Starbucks has developed an excellent brand over the years. Its iconic coffee shops are able to command premium prices over rivals. That has enabled it to generate great margins and post strong results. Starbucks has shown versatility amid inflation and even as wages have been rising. It also has a growing presence around the world.', ""In the company's most recent quarterly results, which wrapped up on Dec. 31, 2023, Starbucks reported global comparable-store sales growth of 5%. Consolidated net revenue rose by 8% year over year to a record $9.4 billion. And net income of just over $1 billion grew by 20%. All told, the business has been performing great."", ""Over the past 12 months, however, shares of Starbucks have fallen by 12%. While the company simply may not be as attractive as other growth stocks, it's still a solid option for income investors. As a business that's still growing internationally and generating fantastic numbers, this could be a good place to invest $5,000 for the long term. With an investment of that size, its 2.5%-yielding dividend -- which is higher than the S&P 500 average yield of 1.4% -- could generate $125 in annual income for your portfolio. "", ""BCE is a top telecom company in Canada. With a lack of competition in the country, it's an industry leader and in a great position to dominate over the long term. Its strong telecom and media assets give investors a diverse business to invest in. Putting $5,000 into the stock could go a long way. "", 'While shares of BCE are down 25% in the past 12 months, I suspect that has more to do with higher interest rates than anything else. BCE is primarily attractive for its dividend, and if investors can get high returns elsewhere, the stock may not be as lucrative of an investment option. But if interest rates come down, this is a prime example of a stock that could start to rally.', 'In the last three months of 2023, BCE reported operating revenue of 6.5 billion Canadian dollars, which was nearly unchanged from the prior-year period. And adjusted earnings of CA$691 million grew by just under 6%. ', ""With the stock's fall in value over the past year, BCE is now yielding 8.6%. A $5,000 investment in the shares could generate around $430 in dividends over the course of a full year. Trading near its low, now could be an ideal time to load up on this stock."", ""Gilead Sciences rounds out this list as another high-yielding investment that could be attractive for income-seeking investors. The healthcare company generates revenue from an increasingly diverse mix of drugs. While its core business centers around HIV drugs (they brought in $4.7 billion in sales over the last three months of 2023), medicines aimed at treating cancer generated $765 million and grew at an impressive rate of 24% year over year. Meanwhile, Gilead Sciences' treatments for liver disease produced $691 million in revenue last quarter."", ""The company's revenue hasn't been growing at a fast rate; product sales were flat last quarter when excluding its COVID-19 treatment, Veklury. But the stability and consistency that Gilead offers makes this an attractive option for dividend investors. At 4.2%, its yield is well above average. And with a $5,000 investment, it would bring in about $210 in dividends on a yearly basis."", ""Gilead's shares are trading near their 52-week low and they've dropped 12% in the past 12 months.

Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?"", ""Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision."", 'Revisions to Earnings Estimates', ""Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock."", ""Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements."", 'For the current quarter, ADM is expected to post earnings of $1.36 per share, indicating a change of -34.9% from the year-ago quarter.

As a matter of fact, the stocks again made headlines on Wednesday after reaching fresh highs.VLO, MPC and PSX climbed to their all-time highs of $182.73, $218.59 and $173.55, respectively. On the day, each of them saw their share price increase about 2%. This jump marks a year-to-date ascent of somewhere between 30% and 45% for the operators."", ""Obviously, the recent rise in oil prices has played a key role in the abovementioned companies' surge. That's a big boon for VLO, MPC and PSX, given that it drives prices at the pumps.Oil prices rallied in the first quarter of 2024, with both Brent and West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude futures registering significant increases. Brent oil, the global benchmark, rose nearly 14%, while WTI, which tracks U.S. crude, surged approximately 16% during the quarter. As of now, the global benchmark settled at $87.48 per barrel, while U.S. crude closed at $83.17 a barrel.Several factors contributed to the uptrend in oil prices. One significant driver was the ongoing production cut by major oil-producing nations, including Russia and members of the OPEC cartel. These cuts helped tighten the supply-demand dynamics in the market, leading to a reduction in global oil inventories.Since 2022, OPEC+ countries, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, have implemented various production cuts to support oil prices as the market grapples with rising U.S. production and sluggish global demand. The latest round of voluntary cuts, which began in January, aimed to reduce combined production targets by approximately 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd).Last month, Saudi Arabia confirmed the decision to extend the voluntary cuts until the end of June. In a surprising move, Russia announced an additional voluntary cut of 471,000 bpd for the second quarter. This decision, along with the commitment from other key producers like Iraq and the UAE to extend their cuts, underscores the collective effort to stabilize oil markets.Geopolitical tensions also played a role in supporting oil prices. Escalating conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Palestine conflict, raised concerns about potential supply disruptions in key oil-producing regions. Additionally, attacks on ships in the Red Sea further heightened market anxieties, contributing to the bullish sentiment.Marathon Petroleum and other downstream operators also benefited from the surge in gasoline prices, as U.S. refiners completed planned maintenance activities. As a result, domestic refinery utilization rates have remained below 90% for an extended period, marking the longest duration of such low utilization in three years."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Continuing the ascension of of Valero Energy, Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 shares were their favorable fourth-quarter results that widely surpassed the bottom-line expectations during the period.VLO’s Q4 earnings of $3.55 per share breezed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.95 a share by 20%.

These stores specialize in offering a wide range of merchandise, including groceries, household items, apparel, electronics, cleaning products, pet supplies and more, at discounted prices compared to traditional retail outlets. Discount stores operate on a low-cost business model, focusing on cost-efficient operations, bulk purchasing and streamlined supply chains to offer competitive pricing.

The Retail – Discount Stores industry has shown resilience, even during economic downturns, as consumers tend to prioritize value-oriented shopping.', '4 Key Industry Trends to Watch', ""Consumers’ Willingness to Spend: The performance of the industry is closely tied to consumers’ purchasing power. Consumer spending, a key catalyst for the economy, has shown resilience despite a tough economic environment. Retail sales in February rose 0.6% sequentially and 1.5% year over year. The backdrop of healthy employment and wage gains has so far bolstered consumer spending. Anticipating a potential interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve in 2024, especially if inflation continues its downward trend, there is an expectation of a further boost to consumer spending. The industry's impressive performance underscores its ability to adapt and thrive in dynamic market conditions. Consumer confidence has been a driving force behind the sector's success."", 'Consumers Seek Better Bargains: The strategy to sell products at discounted prices has helped industry players draw customers in low-to-middle-income groups who have been seeking both value and convenience, particularly in the face of rising prices. Industry participants have been focusing on creating innovative and compelling products and enhancing digital and data analytics capabilities to attract price-sensitive consumers.', 'Digitization Is the Key to Growth: With the change in consumer shopping patterns, industry participants have been evolving to play dual in-store and online roles. Initiatives, such as building omnichannel, coming up with loyalty and marketing programs, enhancing the supply chain and providing faster delivery options, be it doorstep delivery, curbside pickup or buy online and pick up at the store, are worth mentioning. Simultaneously, companies are investing in renovation, improved checkouts and mobile point-of-sale capabilities to keep stores relevant. Keeping in mind consumers’ product preferences and growing inclination toward online shopping, retailers have been replenishing shelves with in-demand merchandise and ramping up investments in digitization.', 'Eye on Margins: Companies in the industry are vying for a bigger share on attributes such as price, products and speed to market. Further, the increasing dominance of e-commerce players has made the retail discount space highly competitive. This has compelled many players to strengthen their digital ecosystem and boost shipping and delivery capabilities. While these endeavors drive sales, they entail high costs. Apart from these, higher marketing, advertising and other store-related expenses might compress margins. However, companies have been focusing on undertaking initiatives to mitigate cost-related challenges.

You may not want to worry about that too much, however. Stocks have a funny way of doing what seems unlikely. Besides, in as little as a year from now, what happened back in April of 2024 won't really matter all that much either."", ""In other words, don't be afraid to step into some new long-term positions at this time. Just pick wisely (as always)."", ""On that note, here's a look at three compelling stock prospects that may prove particularly well-suited for retirement portfolios."", 'Most people have heard of pharmaceutical company Amgen (NASDAQ: AMGN). However, most investors would be hard-pressed to name a single drug it makes -- the company just doesn\'t proverbially ""swing for the fences"" when it comes to R&D or acquisitions. In this vein, the two best-selling drugs of the two dozen in its portfolio each only account for about 15% of the company\'s top line, while no other drug makes up more than 8% of its sales.', ""This isn't a bad thing, though. It's a good thing. Amgen is diversified! That's not something many other drugmakers can say."", ""This isn't to suggest the drugmaker doesn't face the same basic challenges its rivals do. It does. Chief among these challenges is the never-ending expiration of patents. Pharmaceutical companies must constantly refill their developmental pipelines and renew their drug portfolios. Amgen was regularly criticized just a few years back for its seeming lack of research and development."", ""That's since changed, however, in a way that the company and its stock aren't getting enough credit for. For example, its recent acquisition of Horizon Therapeutics provides the new owner with thyroid eye disease therapy Tepezza and gout treatment Krystexxa. In the meantime, Amgen has been steadily beefing up its in-house developmental pipeline, so much so that analysts at BMO Capital upgraded Amgen stock to a rating of outperform late last year specifically because its pipeline was underappreciated. The upgrade echoes optimism from analysts at Leerink Partners shared just a couple of months earlier."", ""The kicker: While February's report on the development of Amgen's anti-obesity drug MariTide failed to initially impress investors, it's now starting to get closer second looks. The treatment is distinctly different than popular anti-obesity drugs like Novo Nordisk's Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound. Although not seemingly as effective as other options at the onset of its use, the benefit of Amgen's drug appears to last even after its use is discontinued. MariTide also requires less frequent injections."", ""The point is, Amgen has more going for it than there seems to be from just a quick glance. The stock's pullback from January's peak creates a buying opportunity."", ""Amgen isn't the only name to consider stepping into while the company's stock is down. Also, take a look at Uranium Energy (NYSEMKT: UEC) while its shares are still 16% below their February peak."", ""It's interesting. To date, the bulk of the worldwide shift away from fossil fuels and toward renewable energy has focused on solar power. And rightfully so. Solar is dependable and increasingly affordable."", ""There's a not-exactly-new option regaining some of its lost popularity, though. That's nuclear power. Although accidents like the 2011 meltdown of a nuclear power plant in Fukushima, Japan, have given the business a black eye, such problems are the exceptions to the norm. Most nuclear power plants operate quite safely -- and quite cleanly -- these days. That's why around 60 nuclear power production facilities are now under construction, according to the World Nuclear Association, with another 110 planned for the future."", 'Of course, these plants need fuel -- uranium, to be specific.', ""Enter Uranium Energy. Just as the name suggests, it's a provider of uranium, with several operational mines (most of which are found within the continental United States). It's one of the world's biggest uranium providers."", ""Although the rise of solar power, the advent of natural gas fracking, and the uncertainty surrounding fossil fuels all created years' worth of turbulence for the nuclear power industry, that dust is finally starting to settle. As it turns out, we still need uranium and an increasing amount of it. That's why uranium prices have nearly tripled in just the past three years alone."", ""It's unlikely that uranium prices will continue to rally at their current pace. But, it is likely that uranium prices will hold near their current levels as the world works to wind down the use of fossil fuels. That's great news for long-term investors interested in this often-ignored stock, which analysts say is worth nearly 50% more than its present price."", 'Last but not least, consider adding Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW) to your retirement portfolio before April comes to a close.', ""In simplest terms, Snowflake helps organizations store and utilize digital data when they can't (or just don't want to) build such solutions for themselves. Walt Disney is a customer, for example, relying on Snowflake to make its digital advertising business more effective. Credit card company MasterCard and drugmaker Sanofi are also paying customers counting on Snowflake for help with things like identifying consumer-spending trends or analyzing clinical drug trial data, respectively. Other potential uses of Snowflake's platform include cybersecurity applications, improving manufacturing processes, and even personalized investment planning, just to name a few. It's facing off with bigger competitors within this cloud database management market. But Snowflake is consistently competitive with these bigger players."", ""The development of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has led to such a need, but the business has only scratched the surface. The analyst community is calling for sales growth of 22% this year to accelerate just a bit next year. Where Snowflake is shining, however, is on the profit front. Finally, with enough scale, Snowflake's bottom line is projected to begin firming up at an even healthier pace."", ""Do know that, of the three stocks in focus here, Snowflake is the most aggressive and highest-risk prospect -- particularly for a retirement portfolio. It's certainly not the kind of foundational holding you'd want to build an entire long-term portfolio around."", ""Given that the stock price is still down to the tune of 60% from its 2021 peak, however, the potential recovery justifies Snowflake's above-average risk for a small sliver of long-term growth-seeking investors."", 'Before you buy stock in Snowflake, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Snowflake wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.', 'Stock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

Sosnick tells Yahoo Finance. ""Some companies have been able to do it. You look at a Nvidia, which is remarkably good at beating and raising, and then beating again.

We're creeping up on it a couple of weeks out. What are your expectations there?"", ""STEVE SOSNICK: Well, this is really the thing. Last quarter, I think, we were sort surprised at how well the market did. Because we came in with high expectations, and for the most part exceeded them and got good guidance. We've ratcheted it up a little bit more over the past three months."", ""And so I think coming in, my fear right now when you come into earnings season as a high-- near a high, which we're awfully close to, there's a lot of good news priced in.

Because that means oil prices are going up and that means inflation. That means inflation is out there lurking."", ""I wrote a piece today, ibkrcampus.com, about how I started to-- how it looks as though we might be seeing a double bottom forming in the price of crude and how XLE, among other measures of energy stocks, has been a terrific performer. And in the last three weeks or so, energy has been outperforming SPX. That's not like this big waving red flag, but it's something to be concerned about because Powell keeps harping on inflationary expectations. Inflation expectations are very closely tied to the price at the pump."", ""The Michigan one-year employment statistic for expectations is basically like a one-month lag of gas prices, one to two-month lag of gas prices. So we haven't really seen the prices accelerate at the pump too much, that's why those have been relatively quiet. But if energy prices stay high, the Fed, on one hand, they want to ignore-- on the PCE they want the core deflator, which excludes volatile food and energy. Except that inflationary expectations among individuals are very heavily tied to the prices of food and energy because those are the things they spend the most on a regular basis. So it's a tough conundrum."", 'JULIE HYMAN: Yeah.', 'JOSH LIPTON: Seasonality too, top of mind, Steve. Sell in May and go away. You think that applies this year?', ""STEVE SOSNICK: I think it's a risk. You know, seasonality is never a perfect-- never perfect, although I will say the rally literally started on November 1. So that's definitely a consideration."", ""This year also, it does start to coincide actually with tax season to a certain extent. A lot of people have a lot of gains over the last year. Will people need to sell stocks to be able to pay the taxes on some of the gains they've made or have they been holding back? We'll find that out."", ""That's a lot of-- that's a lot of where the seasonality comes from. So you throw in April 15 along with earnings season, along with a calendar that's held very tightly to the seasonal-- to the seasonal biases. It's something that, I think, you have to be, if not heading for the hills, you have to think a little more defensively than you've been thinking over the last few months, where it's behooved everybody to play from the-- play offense and play offense heavily.""]"

Well, one fund that might be worth investigating is BNY Mellon Natural Resources A (DNLAX). DNLAX has a Zacks Mutual Fund Rank of 1 (Strong Buy), which is based on various forecasting factors like size, cost, and past performance.', 'Objective', 'We classify DNLAX in the Sector - Energy category, an area that is rife with possible choices. Throughout the massive global energy sector, Sector - Energy mutual funds hold a wide range of quickly changing and vitally important industries. While oil and gas comprise the bulk of the exposure, carbon-based fuels will be the biggest group of assets in these funds, though clean energy is starting to pick up steam.', 'History of Fund/Manager', 'BNY Mellon is based in New York, NY, and is the manager of DNLAX. BNY Mellon Natural Resources A debuted in October of 2003. Since then, DNLAX has accumulated assets of about $141.84 million, according to the most recently available information. The fund is currently managed by David Intoppa who has been in charge of the fund since November of 2020.', 'Performance', 'Investors naturally seek funds with strong performance. This fund has delivered a 5-year annualized total return of 15.44%, and it sits in the top third among its category peers. Investors who prefer analyzing shorter time frames should look at its 3-year annualized total return of 17.2%, which places it in the top third during this time-frame.', ""It is important to note that the product's returns may not reflect all its expenses. Any fees not reflected would lower the returns. Total returns do not reflect the fund's [%] sale charge. If sales charges were included, total returns would have been lower."", ""When looking at a fund's performance, it is also important to note the standard deviation of the returns. The lower the standard deviation, the less volatility the fund experiences. Compared to the category average of 16.26%, the standard deviation of DNLAX over the past three years is 26.7%. The fund's standard deviation over the past 5 years is 28% compared to the category average of 17.98%. This makes the fund more volatile than its peers over the past half-decade."", 'Risk Factors', ""Investors should note that the fund has a 5-year beta of 1.07, so it is likely going to be more volatile than the market at large. Alpha is an additional metric to take into consideration, since it represents a portfolio's performance on a risk-adjusted basis relative to a benchmark, which in this case, is the S&P 500.

But if you try your hand at stock picking, your risk returning less than the market. Unfortunately, that's been the case for longer term Baxter International Inc. (NYSE:BAX) shareholders, since the share price is down 49% in the last three years, falling well short of the market return of around 19%."", ""Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns."", ' View our latest analysis for Baxter International ', 'In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One flawed but reasonable way to assess how sentiment around a company has changed is to compare the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price.', 'Baxter International has made a profit in the past. However, it made a loss in the last twelve months, suggesting profit may be an unreliable metric at this stage. Other metrics might give us a better handle on how its value is changing over time.', ""Revenue is actually up 10.0% over the three years, so the share price drop doesn't seem to hinge on revenue, either. It's probably worth investigating Baxter International further; while we may be missing something on this analysis, there might also be an opportunity."", 'The graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).', 'Baxter International is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. So it makes a lot of sense to check out what analysts think Baxter International will earn in the future (free analyst consensus estimates)', ""When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Baxter International the TSR over the last 3 years was -46%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return."", ""Baxter International provided a TSR of 3.8% over the last twelve months. Unfortunately this falls short of the market return. But at least that's still a gain! Over five years the TSR has been a reduction of 7% per year, over five years. So this might be a sign the business has turned its fortunes around. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important.

The transaction was approved by both companies’ boards of directors.', 'The acquisition of Shockwave further extends Johnson & Johnson MedTech’s position in cardiovascular intervention and accelerates its shift into higher-growth markets. Cardiovascular intervention is one of the fastest-growing global medtech markets, with significant unmet patient need. With the addition of Shockwave, Johnson & Johnson will expand its MedTech cardiovascular portfolio into two of the highest-growth, innovation-oriented segments of cardiovascular intervention – coronary artery disease (CAD) and peripheral artery disease (PAD). The transaction follows Johnson & Johnson MedTech’s successful acquisitions of Abiomed, a leader in heart recovery, and more recently Laminar, an innovator in left atrial appendage elimination for patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AFib). These acquisitions complement and build on Johnson & Johnson’s established global leadership position in electrophysiology through the Biosense Webster portfolio. Following the close of the transaction, Johnson & Johnson MedTech will be a category leader in four high-growth cardiovascular segments.', 'Shockwave is a leading, first-to-market provider of innovative intravascular lithotripsy (IVL) technology for the treatment of calcified CAD and PAD. IVL is a minimally invasive, catheter-based treatment for calcified arterial lesions, which can reduce blood flow and cause pain or heart attack. IVL helps restore blood flow by cracking calcium lesions using sonic pressure waves and is used in both CAD and PAD, often in combination with stenting. Shockwave offers the only commercially available IVL technology and has safely, simply, and effectively treated approximately 400,000 patients globally. In addition to its leading IVL platform, Shockwave also recently acquired Neovasc Inc., a company that has developed the Reducer System, a novel product focused on symptom relief of refractory angina. The Reducer System has a growing commercial presence. It is currently undergoing clinical studies in the U.S. and is CE marked in the European Union and the United Kingdom.', 'Joaquin Duato, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Johnson & Johnson, said, ""With our focus on Innovative Medicine and MedTech, Johnson & Johnson has a long history of tackling cardiovascular disease – the leading cause of death globally. The acquisition of Shockwave and its leading IVL technology provides a unique opportunity to accelerate our impact in cardiovascular intervention and drive greater value for patients, shareholders and health systems.""', 'Tim Schmid, Executive Vice President and Worldwide Chairman of Johnson & Johnson MedTech, said, ""Shockwave offers a truly differentiated opportunity to further enhance our leadership position in medtech, expand into additional high-growth segments, and ultimately transform the future of cardiovascular treatment. Shockwave’s IVL technology for treating CAD and PAD, and its strong pipeline, are in a class of their own. We look forward to bringing Shockwave’s solutions into Johnson & Johnson MedTech and the hands of more physicians around the world.""', '""Shockwave has transformed the treatment of complex calcified arterial disease through the pioneering development of intravascular lithotripsy, and it is our mission to make this remarkable technology available to patients worldwide,"" said Doug Godshall, President and CEO of Shockwave. ""As part of a larger, more diverse organization, with broad expertise and a core focus on improving patient outcomes, we are confident we will be able to further solidify IVL as the global standard of care for patients. I am deeply grateful to our team members and colleagues whose efforts have made today’s milestone possible; their accomplishments and passion have been extraordinary. I could not think of a better partner and home than Johnson & Johnson as the Shockwave team prepares to write its next exciting chapter.""', 'Transaction Benefits', 'Solidifies Johnson & Johnson MedTech’s leadership in cardiovascular intervention: IVL is the only technology that can treat both intimal and medial calcification, and Shockwave offers the first and only commercially available IVL platform for CAD and PAD. This acquisition will complement Johnson & Johnson MedTech’s leadership positions in heart recovery (Abiomed) and electrophysiology (Biosense Webster) to make it a category leader in four of the largest and highest-growth medtech markets within cardiovascular intervention.', 'Enhances opportunity to serve patients worldwide through complementary fit with Johnson & Johnson: Shockwave’s IVL and Abiomed’s Impella® heart pump platform play a critical role in complex percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures. Specifically, IVL is used in approximately 30% of high-risk PCI cases that also use Impella® today. This clinical compatibility, combined with Johnson & Johnson MedTech’s established global commercial infrastructure, provides numerous opportunities to accelerate the adoption of these segment-leading technologies to patients in need.', 'Provides robust pipeline for future growth in underpenetrated markets: Shockwave benefits from a strong pipeline focused on continued innovation and expansion of its product portfolio in CAD and PAD, and the potential use of IVL in new indications, including carotid artery disease and structural heart disease, over the coming years. Shockwave is also evaluating its Reducer System technology in clinical studies to treat patients with refractory angina.', 'Accelerates sales growth: The acquisition of Shockwave accelerates Johnson & Johnson MedTech’s ongoing efforts to increase its presence in high-growth markets with unmet need, while expanding its reach and scale globally. The proposed transaction adds a high-performing business in an underpenetrated category with a strong pipeline and an attractive growth and margin profile. The transaction is expected to accelerate revenue growth for both Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson MedTech. Shockwave is ultimately expected to become Johnson & Johnson MedTech’s thirteenth priority platform, as defined by annual sales of at least $1 billion.', 'Delivers immediate operational accretion: The transaction will be accretive to operating margin for both Johnson & Johnson and Johnson & Johnson MedTech. Johnson & Johnson expects the transaction to be operationally accretive upon closing, but considering the impact of financing costs, is expected to dilute adjusted earnings per share by approximately $0.10 in 2024 and approximately $0.17 in 2025.', 'Transaction Details and Path to Completion', 'Under the terms of the agreement, Johnson & Johnson will acquire all outstanding shares of Shockwave for $335.00 per share in cash through a merger of Shockwave with a wholly owned Johnson & Johnson subsidiary.

In addition to his current responsibilities for Abiomed as the Global Head of Heart Recovery, Michael Bodner will assume responsibility for the business upon close. Isaac Zacharias, who has 6 years with Shockwave, most recently serving as President and Chief Commercial Officer, will transition to become Worldwide President of Shockwave, reporting to Michael Bodner. Doug Godshall, Shockwave’s President and Chief Executive Officer, will advise through the transition.', 'The closing of the transaction is expected to occur by mid-year 2024 subject to the receipt of Shockwave’s shareholder approval, as well as the receipt of applicable regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.

But for more than 125 years, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) has been Wall Street's most-watched index."", ""At its official inception in May 1896, the Dow Jones was composed of a dozen predominantly industrial stocks. Today, it's a 30-component index packed with historically profitable, time-tested, brand-name businesses that have multinational appeal. In other words, it tends to be a stomping ground where investors of all walks can start their searches for foundational long-term holdings."", 'Although the Dow has a history of heading substantially higher over long periods, the outlook for its individual components can vary greatly. As we work our way into the heart of spring, two Dow stocks stand out as no-brainer buys in April, while another longtime constituent can be avoided like the plague.', 'The first Dow Jones stock that stands head-and-shoulders above its peers as a seemingly surefire buy in April is payment-processing company Visa (NYSE: V).', ""The only significant headwind current and prospective Visa shareholders should be mindful of in 2024 is the potential for a U.S. recession. A select group of indicators, including a notable decline in M2 money supply, suggest a heightened likelihood of an economic downturn in the not-too-distant future. When the U.S. economy slows down or contracts, consumers and businesses tend to spend less. That's not good news for a company like Visa that generates its revenue from merchant fees on transactions."", ""But there's a counter to this skepticism that's made patient investors considerably richer. Although recessions are a normal and unavoidable aspect of the economic cycle, they don't last long. Only three of the one dozen recessions in the U.S. since the end of World War II have stuck around for 12 months, with none surpassing 18 months. The U.S. and global economy spend a disproportionate amount of time expanding, which is favorable to Visa's operating model."", ""Speaking of things that are favorable, Visa is the undisputed market-share leader in credit card network purchase volume in the U.S., the world's No. 1 market for consumption. In fact, it's the only payment processor to gain a meaningful share following the Great Recession."", ""There's a lengthy opportunity for Visa to expand its reach into faster-growing emerging markets. Regions that remain underbanked, such as Southeastern Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, are ripe for disruption. Visa can enter these regions with its payment infrastructure organically or via acquisition and power its sales growth for decades to come."", ""If you need one more solid reason to buy into the Visa growth story, let it be the company's laser focus on payment facilitation. Though some of its peers also act as lenders and collect interest income, Visa's choice to steer clear of lending means it doesn't have to set aside capital to cover potential loan losses when economic downturns occur. Visa's flexible balance sheet and purposeful lending avoidance have helped it sustain a profit margin of greater than 50%."", 'A second Dow stock that makes for a phenomenal buy in April is none other than leading beverage company Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).', ""The reason Coca-Cola stock has badly lagged the gains of the major stock indexes (including the Dow) is simple: It's a mature business. During bull markets, it's not uncommon for investors to chase after higher-growth companies."", 'This has made Coke somewhat of an afterthought for the investment community. But forgetting about this time-tested company would be a mistake.', ""One factor Coca-Cola always has in its corner is that it's a consumer staples stock. Though consumer spending habits will shift depending on the health of the U.S. and global economy, things like food and beverages will be purchased in any economic climate. Since Coke provides a basic necessity good (beverages), its cash flow tends to be predictable and transparent year after year."", ""Something else that continues to work in Coca-Cola's favor is its virtually unparalleled geographic diversity. Except for North Korea, Cuba, and Russia (the latter is due to its invasion of Ukraine), it has ongoing operations in every country. This means it can take advantage of faster-growing emerging markets, while also generating predictable cash flow from developed countries. Coca-Cola has more than two dozen brands in its product portfolio generating at least $1 billion in annual sales."", ""Coca-Cola's marketing team deserves credit for its continued success, too. Last year, the company highlighted that it was spending north of 50% of its advertising budget on digital channels, as well as leaning on artificial intelligence (AI) to help tailor ads to individual consumers. But this is a company with more than a century of history in its back pocket. It regularly leans on its storied history to connect with more mature audiences."", ""Although Coca-Cola stock isn't going to double in a matter of months like some hypergrowth tech stocks, it delivers steady growth with minimal volatility -- it's about 41% less volatile than the benchmark S&P 500 -- and has increased its dividend in each of the past 62 years. Further, shares can be purchased for less than 20 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 15% discount to its trailing-five-year forward-earnings multiple."", ""On the other hand, not every Dow stock is going to be a winner. While an argument can be made that it's already taken its fair share of lumps in 2024, commercial airplane manufacturer and defense company Boeing (NYSE: BA) tops the list of Dow components to avoid like the plague."", 'Heading into 2024, Boeing was the top Dow component I highlighted to avoid. At the time, an even greater number of money-based metrics and predictive indicators were forecasting a high probability of a U.S. recession. Despite its hefty backlog of commercial orders, Boeing has historically been one of the worst-performing S&P 500 components during recessions. My expectation was that it would remain grounded if the U.S. economy cooled off or shifted into reverse.', 'Since the year began, Boeing has been clobbered by an assortment of missteps tied to its MAX jetliners. The most glaring of these incidences occurred in early January when a piece of fuselage on a 737 MAX 9 jetliner ripped out mid-flight. Boeing has admitted its fault in the incident and will need to clean up its production process to regain the trust of travelers and its customers.', ""Furthermore, Boeing CEO David Calhoun announced that he'd be stepping down from his post by the end of 2024. While a shake-up in the executive suite has been long overdue at Boeing, changes in leadership result in uncertainty. Wall Street isn't a fan of uncertainty, and Boeing's stock price shows it."", 'Federal Reserve monetary policy represents another potential hurdle for Boeing. The fastest rate-hiking cycle in four decades is a threat to the company on two fronts. First, it took on a significant amount of debt during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may make future refinancing costlier. The other issue is that higher interest rates may discourage airlines from making large purchases and updating their fleets.', ""Lastly, Boeing hasn't demonstrated an ability to stay on course with regard to profits or monthly production forecasts. Toward the tail-end of 2022, Wall Street pegged Boeing for a modest per-share profit in 2023. The company went on to lose $5.81 per share last year."", ""Likewise, Boeing was expected to earn over $5 per share in 2024. This estimate has since been pared down to a loss of $0.71 per share. Until Boeing actually delivers, it's a company worth avoiding."", 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

When considering valuation metrics, the price-to-earnings ratio has always been the obvious choice. This is because calculations based on earnings are easy and come in handy. However, the price-to-sales ratio is convenient for determining the value of stocks that are incurring losses or in an early development cycle, generating meager or no profit.', ""While a loss-making company with a negative price-to-earnings ratio falls out of investor favor, its price-to-sales can indicate the hidden strength of the business. This underrated ratio is also used to identify a recovery situation or ensure a company's growth is not overvalued.A stock’s price-to-sales ratio reflects how much investors pay for each dollar of revenue generated by a company.If the price-to-sales ratio is 1, investors are paying $1 for every $1 of revenues generated by the company. A stock with a price-to-sales below 1 is a good bargain as investors need to pay less than a dollar for a dollar’s worth. \xa0Thus, a stock with a lower price-to-sales ratio is a more suitable investment than a stock with a high price-to-sales ratio.The price-to-sales ratio is often preferred over price-to-earnings, as companies can manipulate their earnings using various accounting measures. However, sales are harder to manipulate and are relatively reliable.However, one should keep in mind that a company with a high debt and a low price-to-sales ratio is not an ideal choice. The high debt level will have to be paid off at some point, leading to further share issuance, a rise in market cap, and, ultimately, a higher price-to-sales ratio.In any case, the price-to-sales ratio used in isolation cannot do the trick.

This will take the dividend yield to an attractive 1.8%, providing a nice boost to shareholder returns."", ' See our latest analysis for TE Connectivity ', ""A big dividend yield for a few years doesn't mean much if it can't be sustained. However, TE Connectivity's earnings easily cover the dividend. This means that most of its earnings are being retained to grow the business."", ""EPS is set to fall by 13.9% over the next 12 months. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 28%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future."", ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.00 in 2014, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $2.60. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 10% per annum over that time. So, dividends have been growing pretty quickly, and even more impressively, they haven't experienced any notable falls during this period."", ""Some investors will be chomping at the bit to buy some of the company's stock based on its dividend history. Earnings have grown at around 4.4% a year for the past five years, which isn't massive but still better than seeing them shrink. If TE Connectivity is struggling to find viable investments, it always has the option to increase its payout ratio to pay more to shareholders."", ""Overall, a dividend increase is always good, and we think that TE Connectivity is a strong income stock thanks to its track record and growing earnings. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. If earnings do fall over the next 12 months, the dividend could be buffeted a little bit, but we don't think it should cause too much of a problem in the long term. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity."", 'Companies possessing a stable dividend policy will likely enjoy greater investor interest than those suffering from a more inconsistent approach.

Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk)."", 'As a result, institutional investors endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by US$587m. Needless to say, the recent loss which further adds to the one-year loss to shareholders of 32% might not go down well especially with this category of shareholders. Institutions or ""liquidity providers"" control large sums of money and therefore, these types of investors usually have a lot of influence over stock price movements.

So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.', ""As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in V.F. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at V.F's earnings history below.

With 9.8% and 8.3% of the shares outstanding respectively, PNC Financial Services Group Inc., Banking Investments and Dodge & Cox are the second and third largest shareholders.', 'We also observed that the top 8 shareholders account for more than half of the share register, with a few smaller shareholders to balance the interests of the larger ones to a certain extent.', ""While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily."", 'While the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Management ultimately answers to the board. However, it is not uncommon for managers to be executive board members, especially if they are a founder or the CEO.', 'Most consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.', 'Our information suggests that V.F. Corporation insiders own under 1% of the company. It is a pretty big company, so it would be possible for board members to own a meaningful interest in the company, without owning much of a proportional interest. In this case, they own around US$50m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably, recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. ', 'The general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 11% stake in V.F. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.', ""I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company.

While acknowledging that Peltz ""identified some things that Disney had mishandled in the past,"" Creutz does not believe the investor had any ""interesting"" plans for Disney\'s future.', 'Looking ahead, Creutz hopes that Disney plans ""to lead the charge"" in re-bundling its direct-to-consumer services, calling it ""the biggest issue the industry faces."" He notes that leaving these channels separate has created additional costs for the business, but this approach could combat that issue. Creutz cites the Warner Bros. (WBD) and Fox (FOX, FOXA) joint ventures as good starting points, but adds that ""it\'s a long way from getting back to a bundled product.""', 'Regarding succession plans at Disney, Creutz says ""it\'s still not clear.""

The entertainment giant saying Wednesday at its annual shareholder meeting that the current Disney board will remain intact after 75% of retail shareholders, they voted in favor of Disney's current board according to a source familiar with the situation."", ""For more, we're joined by Doug Creutz who is the TD Cowen Managing Director and Senior Research Analyst covering the media and entertainment landscape, and Yahoo Finance's Senior Reporter Alexandra Canal. Doug, great to have you here with us this morning. First and foremost, just want to get your reaction, are you at all surprised by what we saw?"", ""- No, I would have been shocked had Peltz or Blackwell's won. I think they just didn't have a lot of vote. They had to convince an awful lot of shareholders to go with them. And I think, you know, while they identified some things that Disney had maybe mishandled in the past, I don't think they had much in the way of a plan for the future that was particularly interesting. So no, I'm not-- I'm not surprised by this at all."", ""- All right so, Doug, here we are today. What happens then next for Iger? We talk about what his priorities should be, obviously, stemming some of the losses that we've seen within the streaming business. But from your perspective, what should be number one on his plate?"", ""DOUG CREUTZ: Well, [CHUCKLES] from my perspective, I think Disney ought to be leading the charge to rebundle all the disparate direct to consumer services out there together. I think that's the biggest issue that the industry faces, is that by leaving bundle behind and going direct to consumer, you've created a lot of overhead additional costs that didn't exist before, both in terms of acquiring users and also in terms of having to overprogram your service relative to what programming you needed in the bundle before."", ""I think that's the direction they should be going. We saw a little bit of that with the streaming JV, the sports JV they announced with Warner and with Fox. I thought that was a good sign. But it's a-- it's a long way from getting back to a bundled product. Which, by the way, I think in the long run will be better for consumers. It was great when you could pay $7 a month to get tons of programming and no advertising."", ""But now increasingly, these services are raising price aggressively, asking consumers to watch advertising. You're seeing major sporting events, the NFL playoff game recently was exclusively through a streaming product. A lot of consumers weren't happy about that. So I think getting back to a bundled product will help the industry and ultimately be better for consumers. I don't know that he views that as a priority but I think that's what it should be."", 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: And Doug, another big priority of Disney is succession planning and that was a big thing, a big conversation amid these proxy battles. When it comes to the board moving forward, how much more pressure are they going to face post-proxy battle? Because this was very high profile. I would assume that now a lot more eyes are on this board to really deliver returns for Disney.', ""DOUG CREUTZ: Yeah, look, they've been trying to figure out how to replace Iger for 10 years, literally. They thought they had a replacement in Bob Chapek but he turned out not to be the guy. It's still not clear that there's somebody internally that's ready to step into the job. And I think to try and get someone externally is very risky given that Disney has a very strong and unique culture, an external candidate might be a bad fit for that."", ""So there is a lot of pressure on the board to find a successor to Iger. I think there was before Peltz raised his hand. I think there is after Peltz has moved on. And that is something that I think investors-- I think right now, 2026 still seems like it's far away. So if you're investors, you're sort of looking at the optimistic outlook for earnings this year and some of the things Disney announced on their last call, like the sports JV and can be excited about that. But as you get closer to 2026, that's going to be more and more of an overhang on shares.""]"

However, current qubits are susceptible to errors, limiting their practicality. Microsoft's approach involves improving the quality of physical qubits and employing advanced techniques to create more reliable virtual qubits, known as logical qubits.Microsoft's achievement stems from coupling its qubit-virtualization system with Quantinuum’s specialized hardware. The team successfully performed multiple active syndrome extractions without destroying the logical qubits. This crucial capability allows for longer and more complex computations without failure, marking a fundamental milestone in quantum error correction.By combining Microsoft's system with Quantinuum’s H-Series ion-trap qubits and unique Quantum Charged Coupled Device architecture, the team claims to have achieved a remarkable two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.8%. This collaboration resulted in the creation of four highly reliable logical qubits from only 30 physical qubits, showcasing an 800-fold improvement in error rates.Integrating these highly reliable logical qubits into Azure Quantum Elements promises a truly hybrid computing experience, combining cloud high-performance computing with advanced AI models and improved quantum-computing capabilities. Microsoft's pursuit of reliable quantum computing continues with the development of topological qubits, aiming to reach error rates of less than one error for every 100 million operations.The company’s achievement meets three fundamental criteria for advancing from noisy, intermediate-scale quantum computing to reliable quantum computing. This includes achieving a large separation between logical and physical error rates, correcting individual circuit errors and generating entanglement between logical qubits. With this breakthrough, Microsoft has demonstrated active syndrome extraction on two logical qubits, marking the transition to reliable quantum computing."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', ""Per MarketandMarkets report, the quantum computing market size is valued at $1.3 billion in 2024. It is anticipated to be $5.3 billion by 2029, witnessing a CAGR of 32.7% during the forecasted period. This imples bright growth prospects for tech giants, including Microsoft, International Business Machines IBM, IonQ IONQ and Rigetti Computing RGTI, among others, competing to create machines that take advantage of quantum mechanics to promise speeds far faster than conventional silicon-based computers. \xa0Through the IBM Quantum Network, IBM has collaborated with more than 250 Fortune 500 companies, universities, labs and startups. Recently, this Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company introduced the IBM Quantum Heron, marking the first in a new series of utility-scale quantum processors.

The system is operational with three IBM Heron processors and associated control electronics, representing a significant step in its quantum-centric supercomputing architecture. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for IBM’s 2024 earnings is pegged at $10.07 per share, unchanged in the past 30 days. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Rigetti Computing is at the forefront of the quantum computing field. Recently, Rigetti deployed the 84-qubit Ankaa-2 quantum computer, with a 2.5X improvement in error performance compared to the company’s previous QPUs and achieved a 98% median 2-qubit fidelity. The company also launched the Novera QPU, a 9-qubit quantum processor unit available for integration into customers’ on-premise systems.Rigetti and Riverlane, the global leader in quantum error correction technology, announced their participation in a project led by the U.S. Department of Energy’s Oak Ridge National Laboratory to explore the challenges of integrating a quantum computer with a large-scale supercomputing centre. This Zacks Rank #2 company has also started a new project with the help of an Innovate U.K. grant. The main goal of this project is to create quantum machine learning methods for looking at streams of financial data. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for RGTI’s 2024 loss has narrowed by 2 cents to 33 cents per share in the past 30 days.IonQ is one of the prominent providers of quantum computing and general-purpose quantum computing systems. Recently, IonQ established its first quantum manufacturing facility in the country in Seattle, WA. Last month, IonQ inked a deal with South Carolina Quantum (SC Quantum). Per the agreement, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company and SC Quantum will work together for the advancement of the quantum ecosystem in South Carolina.IONQ’s latest quantum computer, IonQ Forte, was made available on Amazon Braket, which is Amazon Web Services’ quantum computing service, in the fourth quarter of 2023.

As a matter of fact, the stocks again made headlines on Wednesday after reaching fresh highs.VLO, MPC and PSX climbed to their all-time highs of $182.73, $218.59 and $173.55, respectively. On the day, each of them saw their share price increase about 2%. This jump marks a year-to-date ascent of somewhere between 30% and 45% for the operators."", ""Obviously, the recent rise in oil prices has played a key role in the abovementioned companies' surge. That's a big boon for VLO, MPC and PSX, given that it drives prices at the pumps.Oil prices rallied in the first quarter of 2024, with both Brent and West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude futures registering significant increases. Brent oil, the global benchmark, rose nearly 14%, while WTI, which tracks U.S. crude, surged approximately 16% during the quarter. As of now, the global benchmark settled at $87.48 per barrel, while U.S. crude closed at $83.17 a barrel.Several factors contributed to the uptrend in oil prices. One significant driver was the ongoing production cut by major oil-producing nations, including Russia and members of the OPEC cartel. These cuts helped tighten the supply-demand dynamics in the market, leading to a reduction in global oil inventories.Since 2022, OPEC+ countries, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, have implemented various production cuts to support oil prices as the market grapples with rising U.S. production and sluggish global demand. The latest round of voluntary cuts, which began in January, aimed to reduce combined production targets by approximately 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd).Last month, Saudi Arabia confirmed the decision to extend the voluntary cuts until the end of June. In a surprising move, Russia announced an additional voluntary cut of 471,000 bpd for the second quarter. This decision, along with the commitment from other key producers like Iraq and the UAE to extend their cuts, underscores the collective effort to stabilize oil markets.Geopolitical tensions also played a role in supporting oil prices. Escalating conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Palestine conflict, raised concerns about potential supply disruptions in key oil-producing regions. Additionally, attacks on ships in the Red Sea further heightened market anxieties, contributing to the bullish sentiment.Marathon Petroleum and other downstream operators also benefited from the surge in gasoline prices, as U.S. refiners completed planned maintenance activities. As a result, domestic refinery utilization rates have remained below 90% for an extended period, marking the longest duration of such low utilization in three years."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Continuing the ascension of of Valero Energy, Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 shares were their favorable fourth-quarter results that widely surpassed the bottom-line expectations during the period.VLO’s Q4 earnings of $3.55 per share breezed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.95 a share by 20%.

Last month, roughly 420 of the brewer’s workers at a plant in Fort Worth, Texas, went on strike after the union representing them, the Teamsters, failed to reach a deal with the beverage giant for a new contract. The strike has continued for over a month since it began in late February.', 'In an emailed statement, Molson Coors chief communications officer Adam Collins said the company remains committed to reaching an agreement with the union, offering competitive wages and participating in roughly 40 negotiating sessions. Despite the strike, the company has continued making beer at the plant with the help of salaried employees and other company employees.', '“We\'re still brewing, packaging and shipping out of Fort Worth, we have exceeded all of our weekly production expectations during this time, and last week we actually set a daily production record since the strike began,” Collins said. “Our other five U.S. breweries are also absorbing extra production, and we deliberately built up distributor inventories earlier in the year.""', 'Negotiations between the two parties were called off last week after they failed to come to a contract agreement, with Molson Coors offering five cents more on top of its initial 99-cent-per-hour raise proposal for its workers, according to Teamsters. In a statement, Teamsters General President Sean M. O’Brien said\xa0the union has no plans to end the strike until the company presents a “respectable contract.”', ""“Molson Coors doesn't care about Texas workers or their hard labor or the sacrifices their families have made to make the company rich,” O’Brien said.\xa0“The corporate end game here is to try to drive the union out of the brewery in Texas. Molson Coors wants to break the workers.”""]"

Gains across its premium and super-premium brands have been contributing to the company's performance. Strength in the Jack Daniel’s family of brands and momentum in the Ready-to-Drink (RTD) category have been key drivers.BF.B is also on track with its long-term pricing strategy, which aims to increase prices year over year to grow sales as part of its sales growth management initiatives.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for BF.B’s current financial-year sales and earnings suggests improvements of 0.3% and 4.8%, respectively, from the year-ago reported numbers."", ""Brown-Forman’s premiumization strategy is playing out well, as evident from growth of its premium and super-premium brands. The company has been strategically reshaping its portfolio over the past couple of decades to focus on premium and super-premium brands. Its portfolio of premium and super-premium brands mainly includes the iconic Jack Daniel's and Woodford Reserve.Higher volumes for Woodford Reserve and super-premium American whiskey portfolio, led by growth in Woodford Reserve; the launch of Jack Daniel’s American Single Malta and Jack Daniel’s Single Barrel; and the acquisitions of Gin Mare and Diplomático contributed to sales growth in the Travel Retail channel in the first nine months of fiscal 2024. Net sales in the Travel Retail channel advanced 3% on a reported basis and 1% on an organic basis.The recently launched Jack Daniel's and Coca-Cola RTD has been a strong addition to the portfolio, which reflects progress on its commitment to the premiumization of its portfolio. Also, the company is on track to integrate the two new super-premium brands — Gin Mare and Diplomático — in the Rest of the Portfolio category. These brands increased reported sales in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 by 11% year over year on an organic basis. Further, the company expects these brands to be meaningful contributors to its long-term growth.Brown-Forman’s Jack Daniels family of brands has been the cornerstone of the company’s financial success, given its legacy of craftsmanship, innovation and enduring consumer loyalty. Jack Daniel’s diverse product line, including various expressions and limited editions, allows Brown-Forman to cater to a wide range of consumer preferences and markets. The global footprint of Jack Daniel’s is a testament to its universal appeal. It consistently accounts for a significant portion of the company’s revenues and is a driving force behind its sustained growth. The brand’s ability to adapt to changing market dynamics, while maintaining its core identity, has contributed to its enduring popularity and profitability.Brown-Forman has demonstrated its adaptability and innovation through the development of a RTD portfolio. The company has seen remarkable success in the RTD category, which reported 17% organic sales growth in the first nine months of fiscal 2024 due to consumer preference for convenience and flavor. With a blend of iconic brands and innovative flavors, Brown-Forman’s RTD offerings have carved a niche in a dynamic market.The success of its RTD portfolio is evident in its consistent growth. The RTD category in Mexico, for instance, has experienced significant expansion, driven by the popularity of New Mix. Sales for New Mix improved 34% on a reported basis and 17% on an organic basis, driven by higher volumes and prices. Jack Daniel’s RTDs/Ready-to-Pours reported 1% sales growth each on a reported and organic basis, driven by the launch of the Jack Daniel’s & Coca-Cola RTD."", 'Shares of Brown-Forman reflect a slowdown over the past three months, mainly as elevated input costs and tough distributor inventory comparisons hurt the third-quarter fiscal 2024 results to some extent. The company is likely to witness higher SG&A expenses in fiscal 2024 on expectations of higher compensation-related expenses.Shares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have lost 5.9% in the past three months compared with the industry’s decline of 2.4%.

Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. Basically this means that a company has profitable initiatives that it can continue to reinvest in, which is a trait of a compounding machine. So on that note, General Motors (NYSE:GM) looks quite promising in regards to its trends of return on capital."", ""Just to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. The formula for this calculation on General Motors is:"", 'Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)', '0.054 = US$9.6b ÷ (US$273b - US$94b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).', ""So, General Motors has an ROCE of 5.4%.  In absolute terms, that's a low return and it also under-performs the Auto industry average of 10%."", ' See our latest analysis for General Motors ', ""Above you can see how the current ROCE for General Motors compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering General Motors  for free."", ""We're glad to see that ROCE is heading in the right direction, even if it is still low at the moment. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 5.4%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 23%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers."", ""All in all, it's terrific to see that General Motors is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. Since the stock has only returned 18% to shareholders over the last five years, the promising fundamentals may not be recognized yet by investors. Given that, we'd look further into this stock in case it has more traits that could make it multiply in the long term."", ""If you want to know some of the risks facing General Motors we've found 3 warning signs (2 are a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing here."", ""While General Motors may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

Shortly after the plane touched the runway, the captain disabled the autobrakes, according to the report.', '“He did not ‘slow too much initially’ because the runway appeared dry, he wanted to expedite their time on the runway, and because he preferred decelerating gradually for passenger comfort,” the NTSB said.', 'As the plane neared the end of the runway, the captain tried to steer on to a taxiway while pushing aggressively on the brake pedals, the NTSB said.

(NASDAQ:UAL) is a cheap stock. Shares trade at a forward price-earnings ratio of 5 and a forward enterprise value/Ebitda ratio of 3.80. Comparably, the S&P 500 trades at roughly 22 times forward earnings.', 'The stock has a GF Value of roughly $67 per share, which represents a 37% premium to the share price at the time of writing. However, it may be cheap for a reason and further analysis is required.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with UAL.', 'The airline business is highly competitive. United competes with other U.S. airlines, including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL), Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK), JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE). The company also competes with foreign carries on international routes. The result is that the airline business tends to be a very low-margin business.', 'Air travel demand is highly cyclical and tends to be driven by economic trends. The high degree of cyclicality is especially challenging for airlines due to the high fixed-cost structure required to operate.', 'The airline business is a very capital-intensive as well since the companies are forced to invest substantial capital to maintain and operate fleets of airplanes. For 2023, United reported adjusted capital expenditures of roughly $7.90 billion, which represents approximately 15% of annual revenue.', 'The result of these factors is that United and other airlines have historically struggled to generate solid returns on invested capital.', 'United currently has adjusted net debt of roughly $24 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.90 based on 2023 adjusted Ebitdar. This level of leverage is fairly high for any company, but is especially high for an extremely cyclical company.', ""The company is rated below investment grade, but was recently upgraded to BB- by Fitch and S&P. In its ratings upgrade, Fitch noted the company's credit metrics improved significantly during 2023."", ""Despite an improving credit profile, United remains highly levered. Its high degree of leverage has the potential to be problematic in the event of a serious economic downturn that results in a challenging operating environment. Additionally, United's high degree of leverage means it is exposed to potential increases in interest rates, which would require debt to be refinanced at higher levels."", 'United currently trades at a moderate discount to peers. It has a forward enterprise value/Ebitda ratio of 3.80. Comparably, Delta, American Airlines and Southwest have respective forward EV/Ebitda ratios of 5.10, 4.80 and 5.40. JetBlue and Spirit Airlines, two smaller carriers which have been struggling of late, trade at forward EV/Ebitda ratios of 8.40 and 6.40.', 'On a forward price-earnings ratio basis, United trades at just 5 times forward earnings per share. Comparably, Delta, American and Southwest respectively trade at 7.40 times, 6.20 times and 18.80 times forward earnings.', 'While the discount versus Southwest is warranted given it has a much healthier balance sheet, the discount versus Delta and American Airlines does not appear to be warranted, in my opinion.', ""United's net leverage ratio of roughly 2.90 is similar to Delta and better than American Airlines. In terms of revenue and earnings growth, the company is expected to deliver similar results to these two companies and faces similar risks. Additionally, United, Delta and American Airlines all have large frequent-flyer businesses, which represent a key source of value. For these reasons, I do not believe United's valuation discount in comparison to Delta and American is warranted."", 'One of the most valuable parts of United is its MileagePlus business. The way this business works is the company sells miles to credit card companies and other third-party partners while also purchasing some miles itself to offset member miles earned via flights.', ""In 2020, United used the MileagePlus business as collateral to help raise debt needed to allow it to navigate the Covid-19 pandemic's disruption. At that time, the business was valued at 12 times Ebitda, or nearly $22 billion, and produced roughly 34% Ebitda margins. It is a high-quality business due to its stable free cash flow generation and strong Ebitda margins."", ""In 2022, United explored selling part of its MileagePlus business to raise cash, but did not complete a transaction. At Citi's Global Industrial Tech & Mobility Conference, Chief Financial Officer Mike Leskinen suggested that monetization of the MileagePlus business is still possible:"", '""We have an incredible high-margin, asset-light growth business within United Airlines. And 2 of our competitors have similar businesses. And right now, those businesses are deeply, deeply undervalued. And if I cannot through disclosure help the capital markets recognize the value of Mileage Plus, we have other levers we can press to create shareholder value. But it is a compelling business and it is -- and you\'re going to have to stay tuned for our May 1 Investor Day. But there is -- there are even some more growth opportunities to this business that are unappreciated.', 'So we\'re going to try to educate the Street on those opportunities. We\'re going to show you results. We\'re going to segment out over time. So you can see the high-margin nature of the business and the growth trajectory of that business. And I think that will accrue to shareholders. If it doesn\'t, we\'ll do something more aggressive.""', 'While it is difficult to predict what more aggressive actions the company may be contemplating, I think two potential options include a minority sale stake to a private equity investor or a spinoff of the MileagePlus business in which United maintains majority control. Such a transaction does not come without precedent as Air Canada spun off its mileage business via a 2005 initial public offering. However, Air Canada ultimately repurchased the business in 2019.', 'I would view a spinoff or minority stake sale in the MileagePlus business as a major positive for shareholders as it represents a way for the company to unlock value.', ""One key risk to consider is that United faces is potential regulations following a series of safety-related issues. CEO Scott Kirby has already sent a memo to customers reassuring them that safety is the airline's top prioritym but regulators remain concerned. The Federal Aviation Administration is said to be considering implementing restrictions, such as limiting United from adding new routes or restricting the company's ability to fly passengers on newly delivered aircraft."", 'Additionally, United Airlines has heavy exposure to the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX aircraft. It is the largest operator of the 737 MAX planes, which account for 8% of its total capacity. In addition to this, the company also has a significant amount of 737 MAX orders which have already been placed. The company is expected to take delivery of 100 737 MAX planes in 2024 and an additional 201 737 MAX planes after 2024.', ""Flights of the aircraft have recently resumed after being grounded following a recent door plug blowout incident on Alaska Airlines (NYSE:ALK). Any future problems with Boeing's planes have the potential to pose a risk to United Airlines given the company's dependance on them."", 'I believe United Airlines should trade at a significant discount to the broader market given the challenging nature of the airline industry due to a mix of high competition, significant cyclicality, high fixed costs, high capital requirements and low historical returns on invested capital. However, I believe the current discount to the broader market is too large and United is undervalued at current levels.', 'The stock currently trades at a roughly 36% discount to the average valuation of close peers Delta and American Airlines based on forward price-earnings ratios. I do not find this discount to be warranted given the fact that United is fairly similar to Delta and American Airlines. All three airlines have similar near-term earnings growth prospects and are faced with the same industry challenges, along with highly levered balance sheets.', ""While it is possible that United becomes subject to potential regulatory restrictions, I think the impact of such restrictions will be limited and is unlikely to impact the company's long-term earnings potential."", ""Additionally, I view the recent comments by United's CFO regarding a potential monetization of MileagePlus as a key positive for the stock and a potential upside catalyst. Thus, I currently view United as moderately undervalued and an attractive investment opportunity relative to its peers."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

They’re beginning to be more selective with how they spend their discretionary cash.', 'In any case, let’s harness the power of TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to tune into three leisure stocks highly favored by Wall Street right now.', 'Royal Caribbean Cruise stock has been cruising higher over the past year, leaving its industry rivals to tread water. At writing, RCL stock is flirting with new all-time highs after surging more than 300% from the dark depths of 2022.', 'While Royal Caribbean has been enjoying the ascent, its peers are still struggling to sustain any sort of positive momentum. Just have a look at the stock charts of the major cruise lines and you’ll see the story that’s unfolding. Royal seems well-equipped to take market share over the foreseeable future.', 'Undoubtedly, the premier nature (it doesn’t get classier than Royal) of the firm’s cruise lines is paying off big-time as it cashes in on robust booking demand for the most leisurely of travels. With distinct advantages over peers (fabulous new ships, like Silver Nova, have been setting sail, with Utopia of the Seas to do so this summer) and no signs of demand reversal, I have to stay bullish on RCL stock.', 'Why settle for an older ship at a lower price when you have profound innovations packed in the latest and greatest ships that offer unmatched experiences for those with a taste for luxury?', 'Royal Caribbean shows that sometimes you’ve got to spend money to make money. Not only that, but RCL could gain market share and have what it takes to pad its long-term margins as more cruisers look to crave (and pay up for) the very best.', 'RCL stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 10 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average RCL stock price target\xa0of $150.67 implies 11.6% upside potential.', 'For deep-value investors seeking to bet on the underdog, Carnival looks to be the more intriguing comeback play. Undoubtedly, the tides have been turned in favor of Royal Caribbean in recent quarters, but Carnival has been no slouch, with an impressive 53% gain posted over the past year.', 'At this juncture, it’s unclear how Carnival can gain share over its high-end rival. Perhaps a broadening out of a cruising bull market would benefit Carnival. In any case, I’m staying bullish on CCL stock, primarily due to the modest valuation and its favorable positioning with the budget-conscious family crowd.', 'Like Royal, Carnival has benefited from similar industry dynamics (record bookings and improving margins). And though Carnival has new ships (Carnival Jubilee) of its own to get cruisers excited and ready to book, it also has to balance fleet expansion investments with debt reduction plans. It’s a fine balance, but it’s one that could allow CCL stock to sail higher as the industry continues with its recovery.', 'One thing to note is that the Baltimore Bridge collapse is expected to hit adjusted earnings by $10 million. In any case, the disaster’s impact on the bottom line seems mostly baked in right here.', 'CCL stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 14 Buys and one Hold assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average CCL stock price target\xa0of $22.75 implies 51.1% upside potential.', 'Apart from the cruisers, MGM Resorts looks like an intriguing option for investors looking to play a leisure stock comeback at a dirt-cheap multiple. At writing, shares of the iconic Vegas staple trade at just 14.9 times trailing price-to-earnings, well below the resorts & casinos industry average of 20.7 times. Just last week, Mizuho (NYSE:MFG) stepped forward, starting MGM stock with a Buy rating, saying the stock is undervalued.', 'Indeed, as consumer discretionary income bounces back, MGM is a prime candidate to benefit. As such, I’m staying bullish on the stock as we head into the summer months. “We see a compelling FCF and stock buyback value creation path, whereby MGM could theoretically buy $4-5 billion of stock over the next five years,” said Mizuho’s Ben Chaiken.', 'Undoubtedly, MGM may not be a growth darling, but it’s certainly a cash cow — one that could get fatter as demand for leisurely travel starts to pick up.', 'Given the rise in digital gaming, which allows gamblers to place bets from the comfort of their own homes, one can’t help but imagine that more people have developed an appetite for rolling the dice. That doesn’t just entail a rise in digital gaming but possibly more trips to Vegas. Either way, MGM stands out as a firm worth betting on as the economy heats up.', 'MGM stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 12 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The\xa0average MGM stock price target\xa0of $56.46 implies 23.1% upside potential.', 'Leisure stocks may be ready to rip higher as the American economy continues exhibiting resilience. From the cruise lines to the Vegas icons, a strong U.S. economy can act as a huge tide that lifts all ships in the scene. Of the trio of Strong Buys, Wall Street seems to like CCL stock the most, with ~51% in gains expected over the year ahead.', 'Disclosure']"

But for more than 125 years, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) has been Wall Street's most-watched index."", ""At its official inception in May 1896, the Dow Jones was composed of a dozen predominantly industrial stocks. Today, it's a 30-component index packed with historically profitable, time-tested, brand-name businesses that have multinational appeal. In other words, it tends to be a stomping ground where investors of all walks can start their searches for foundational long-term holdings."", 'Although the Dow has a history of heading substantially higher over long periods, the outlook for its individual components can vary greatly. As we work our way into the heart of spring, two Dow stocks stand out as no-brainer buys in April, while another longtime constituent can be avoided like the plague.', 'The first Dow Jones stock that stands head-and-shoulders above its peers as a seemingly surefire buy in April is payment-processing company Visa (NYSE: V).', ""The only significant headwind current and prospective Visa shareholders should be mindful of in 2024 is the potential for a U.S. recession. A select group of indicators, including a notable decline in M2 money supply, suggest a heightened likelihood of an economic downturn in the not-too-distant future. When the U.S. economy slows down or contracts, consumers and businesses tend to spend less. That's not good news for a company like Visa that generates its revenue from merchant fees on transactions."", ""But there's a counter to this skepticism that's made patient investors considerably richer. Although recessions are a normal and unavoidable aspect of the economic cycle, they don't last long. Only three of the one dozen recessions in the U.S. since the end of World War II have stuck around for 12 months, with none surpassing 18 months. The U.S. and global economy spend a disproportionate amount of time expanding, which is favorable to Visa's operating model."", ""Speaking of things that are favorable, Visa is the undisputed market-share leader in credit card network purchase volume in the U.S., the world's No. 1 market for consumption. In fact, it's the only payment processor to gain a meaningful share following the Great Recession."", ""There's a lengthy opportunity for Visa to expand its reach into faster-growing emerging markets. Regions that remain underbanked, such as Southeastern Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, are ripe for disruption. Visa can enter these regions with its payment infrastructure organically or via acquisition and power its sales growth for decades to come."", ""If you need one more solid reason to buy into the Visa growth story, let it be the company's laser focus on payment facilitation. Though some of its peers also act as lenders and collect interest income, Visa's choice to steer clear of lending means it doesn't have to set aside capital to cover potential loan losses when economic downturns occur. Visa's flexible balance sheet and purposeful lending avoidance have helped it sustain a profit margin of greater than 50%."", 'A second Dow stock that makes for a phenomenal buy in April is none other than leading beverage company Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).', ""The reason Coca-Cola stock has badly lagged the gains of the major stock indexes (including the Dow) is simple: It's a mature business. During bull markets, it's not uncommon for investors to chase after higher-growth companies."", 'This has made Coke somewhat of an afterthought for the investment community. But forgetting about this time-tested company would be a mistake.', ""One factor Coca-Cola always has in its corner is that it's a consumer staples stock. Though consumer spending habits will shift depending on the health of the U.S. and global economy, things like food and beverages will be purchased in any economic climate. Since Coke provides a basic necessity good (beverages), its cash flow tends to be predictable and transparent year after year."", ""Something else that continues to work in Coca-Cola's favor is its virtually unparalleled geographic diversity. Except for North Korea, Cuba, and Russia (the latter is due to its invasion of Ukraine), it has ongoing operations in every country. This means it can take advantage of faster-growing emerging markets, while also generating predictable cash flow from developed countries. Coca-Cola has more than two dozen brands in its product portfolio generating at least $1 billion in annual sales."", ""Coca-Cola's marketing team deserves credit for its continued success, too. Last year, the company highlighted that it was spending north of 50% of its advertising budget on digital channels, as well as leaning on artificial intelligence (AI) to help tailor ads to individual consumers. But this is a company with more than a century of history in its back pocket. It regularly leans on its storied history to connect with more mature audiences."", ""Although Coca-Cola stock isn't going to double in a matter of months like some hypergrowth tech stocks, it delivers steady growth with minimal volatility -- it's about 41% less volatile than the benchmark S&P 500 -- and has increased its dividend in each of the past 62 years. Further, shares can be purchased for less than 20 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 15% discount to its trailing-five-year forward-earnings multiple."", ""On the other hand, not every Dow stock is going to be a winner. While an argument can be made that it's already taken its fair share of lumps in 2024, commercial airplane manufacturer and defense company Boeing (NYSE: BA) tops the list of Dow components to avoid like the plague."", 'Heading into 2024, Boeing was the top Dow component I highlighted to avoid. At the time, an even greater number of money-based metrics and predictive indicators were forecasting a high probability of a U.S. recession. Despite its hefty backlog of commercial orders, Boeing has historically been one of the worst-performing S&P 500 components during recessions. My expectation was that it would remain grounded if the U.S. economy cooled off or shifted into reverse.', 'Since the year began, Boeing has been clobbered by an assortment of missteps tied to its MAX jetliners. The most glaring of these incidences occurred in early January when a piece of fuselage on a 737 MAX 9 jetliner ripped out mid-flight. Boeing has admitted its fault in the incident and will need to clean up its production process to regain the trust of travelers and its customers.', ""Furthermore, Boeing CEO David Calhoun announced that he'd be stepping down from his post by the end of 2024. While a shake-up in the executive suite has been long overdue at Boeing, changes in leadership result in uncertainty. Wall Street isn't a fan of uncertainty, and Boeing's stock price shows it."", 'Federal Reserve monetary policy represents another potential hurdle for Boeing.

The travel restrictions posed to control the spread of the pandemic also resulted in a 62% dip in export revenues generated by international tourism in 2020, which was the highest number ever recorded. 2021 saw another 59% decrease in international tourism export revenues as compared to the 2019 statistics. Although these numbers bounced back in 2022, they still remained 34% lower than the pre-pandemic statistics.

He helms Appaloosa Management -- the hedge fund he founded back in 1993. He has been called ""arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation"" and also consistently outperforms his peers.', ""He correctly predicted the collapse of the housing market and the resulting financial crisis that led to the Great Recession in 2008. He also loaded up on bank stocks at the depths of the downturn, a strategy that eventually turned a significant profit for Appaloosa investors. With a resume like that, it's no wonder that many investors follow his moves with keen interest."", 'It raised some eyebrows when Tepper significantly reduced his stakes in Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) in the fourth quarter while opting to increase his stakes in two other members of the ""Magnificent Seven.""', ""In the fourth quarter, Tepper made some big changes to the upper echelons of Appaloosa's portfolio, cutting his stake in Nvidia by 23%. He obviously still sees upside in the stock, as the hedge fund still owns 790,000 shares worth an estimated $678 million). And Nvidia is still Appaloosa's fourth-largest holding at nearly 7% of the portfolio."", ""The sale was likely a calculated move on Tepper's part. After all, Nvidia gained 239% last year and was selling for 65 times earnings and 27 times sales, so its valuation was steep."", ""Tepper also slashed his stake in Alphabet stock by 16%, though it remains the fund's seventh-largest holding. Appaloosa now owns 2.3 million shares worth about $388 million."", ""In this case, though, there's no obvious catalyst explaining his decision to sell. The stock was still reasonably priced at year's end, trading for 24 times earnings. He may have had concerns about the timing of the rebound in the digital ad market -- which is responsible for the lion's share of Alphabet's revenue -- or questions about how AI will ultimately impact Google's near monopoly in search."", ""In moves that aren't too surprising, Tepper added to his existing stakes in two of Appaloosa's top three holdings, as he's apparently still bullish on their prospects."", ""Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) cemented its place as the hedge fund's No. 2 holding as Tepper increased his stake by 4%. This brought the total count to 1.7 million shares currently worth roughly $710 million, or 11.3% of Appaloosa's holdings. Microsoft arguably kick-started the AI revolution when it invested in Chat-GPT creator OpenAI and integrated generative AI capabilities across a broad cross-section of its workplace productivity tools."", 'The biggest opportunity, however, is likely Copilot, its AI-powered digital assistant. Microsoft debuted a number of job-specific versions of Copilot that help automate otherwise time-consuming tasks. The company gained cloud market share, the result of strong demand for its AI tools.', 'Microsoft stock was selling for a slight premium of 34 times sales at the end of the fourth quarter, but given its quick move into the AI marketplace and the potential for profits, that valuation is more than reasonable.', ""Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) was the second of Tepper's Magnificent Seven purchases. He increased his holdings by 5%, bringing Appaloosa's total stake to 3.95 million shares. At their current value of about $711 million, they account for 11% of the portfolio. As the undisputed cloud infrastructure leader, Amazon has a captive audience for its AI products and services."", 'The company released a bevy of helpful tools on its e-commerce platform to streamline the processes of selling goods and buying advertising. Furthermore, Amazon has a long history of managing its online retail business in part with AI systems, which help it maintain adequate inventory levels, surface relevant recommendations, schedule more efficient delivery routes, and more.', 'And with the stock trading at less than 3 times sales at the end of the fourth quarter, Amazon was a steal.', ""So far, Tepper's results from these moves have been mixed. Nvidia stock gained 80% so far this year, which has kept it in its position as the undisputed champion among the Magnificent Seven. Alphabet stock is up 11%. Over the same period, Amazon and Microsoft have gained 20% and 12%, respectively. This suggests that Tepper would have been better off had he not made any changes at all to his allocations to these stocks."", ""There's a lesson here for investors. If the investing thesis for one of your holdings hasn't changed -- even if the stock sports a nosebleed valuation -- it's sometimes best to stay the course. The AI revolution has just started, and while competition is ramping up, Nvidia's AI processors are still the best in the business.

The constantly evolving nature of tech allows companies to profit from reliable demand for upgrades to various hardware and software products.', ""As a result, it's no surprise that Warren Buffett's company, Berkshire Hathaway, dedicated almost 50% of its portfolio to the high-growth industry.

In its fourth quarter of 2024 (which ended in January), the company's revenue increased by 265% year over year to $22 billion. Operating income jumped 983% to nearly $14 billion. The meteoric rise was primarily thanks to a 409% increase in data center revenue, reflecting a spike in AI GPU sales."", ""Additionally, Nvidia's free cash flow is up 430% in the last year to more than $27 billion, significantly higher than AMD's $1 billion and Intel's -$14 billion. So, despite new GPU releases from both competitors, Nvidia's head start in AI potentially pushed the company further ahead, providing it with more significant cash reserves to continue investing in technology and retain market supremacy."", ""Nvidia's price-to-free-cash-flow and price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios plunged in the last year, indicating its stock is at one of its best-valued positions in 12 months."", 'Data by YCharts', ""P/E is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings per share.

According to Deloitte Insights, gross premiums are estimated to increase sixfold to $722 billion by 2030. Analysts at Swiss Re Institute predict year-over-year premium growth of 5.5% for 2024.However, catastrophes and non-life insurers’ profitability are inversely related. Per reports in Aon, total economic losses were $380 billion in 2023, whereas insured losses were $118 million. According to AM Best, the total net underwriting loss was $38 billion in 2023, a 10-year high, largely attributable to weather-related losses, high inflation and reinsurance pricing pressure. Underwriting losses are expected to primarily result from the soft performance in personal lines, which are expected to witness higher catastrophe losses, per Insurance Information Institute and Milliman.However, exposure growth, better pricing, prudent underwriting and favorable reserve development will help withstand the blow. Also, frequent occurrences of natural disasters should accelerate the policy renewal rate.The insurance industry is rate-sensitive. The Fed made four hikes in 2023, taking the rate to 11 since March 2022. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers. The Fed has held interest rates unchanged at 5.25-5.5% at the December FOMC meeting. An improving rate environment is a boon for insurers, especially long-tail insurers. Also, investment income is an essential component of insurers’ top lines.Product diversification helps industry players lower concentration risks, ensure uninterrupted revenue generation and improve retention ratio. Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums of life insurance operations. Also, per Deloitte Insights, the transition to green energy and related insurance products, as well as exposure to intangible assets, offers growth opportunities. Per a report in Carrier Management, AM Best expects profitable commercial lines and improving personal lines for 2024.Increased awareness, driving higher demand for protection products, should benefit sales and premiums for life insurance operations. Continued improvements in pricing and an increase in exposure should support premium growth. A compelling product portfolio will enhance sales of life insurers. Per a report published in ReporterLinker, global life insurance gross written premium is expected to be $2.5 trillion by 2026. Per a Statista report, the gross written premium is expected to see an annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2028) of 1.7%.Players are investing heavily in technology to improve basis points, scale and efficiencies.

Doug, great to have you here with us this morning. First and foremost, just want to get your reaction, are you at all surprised by what we saw?"", ""- No, I would have been shocked had Peltz or Blackwell's won. I think they just didn't have a lot of vote. They had to convince an awful lot of shareholders to go with them. And I think, you know, while they identified some things that Disney had maybe mishandled in the past, I don't think they had much in the way of a plan for the future that was particularly interesting. So no, I'm not-- I'm not surprised by this at all."", ""- All right so, Doug, here we are today. What happens then next for Iger? We talk about what his priorities should be, obviously, stemming some of the losses that we've seen within the streaming business. But from your perspective, what should be number one on his plate?"", ""DOUG CREUTZ: Well, [CHUCKLES] from my perspective, I think Disney ought to be leading the charge to rebundle all the disparate direct to consumer services out there together. I think that's the biggest issue that the industry faces, is that by leaving bundle behind and going direct to consumer, you've created a lot of overhead additional costs that didn't exist before, both in terms of acquiring users and also in terms of having to overprogram your service relative to what programming you needed in the bundle before."", ""I think that's the direction they should be going. We saw a little bit of that with the streaming JV, the sports JV they announced with Warner and with Fox. I thought that was a good sign. But it's a-- it's a long way from getting back to a bundled product. Which, by the way, I think in the long run will be better for consumers. It was great when you could pay $7 a month to get tons of programming and no advertising."", ""But now increasingly, these services are raising price aggressively, asking consumers to watch advertising. You're seeing major sporting events, the NFL playoff game recently was exclusively through a streaming product. A lot of consumers weren't happy about that. So I think getting back to a bundled product will help the industry and ultimately be better for consumers. I don't know that he views that as a priority but I think that's what it should be."", 'ALEXANDRA CANAL: And Doug, another big priority of Disney is succession planning and that was a big thing, a big conversation amid these proxy battles. When it comes to the board moving forward, how much more pressure are they going to face post-proxy battle? Because this was very high profile. I would assume that now a lot more eyes are on this board to really deliver returns for Disney.', ""DOUG CREUTZ: Yeah, look, they've been trying to figure out how to replace Iger for 10 years, literally. They thought they had a replacement in Bob Chapek but he turned out not to be the guy. It's still not clear that there's somebody internally that's ready to step into the job. And I think to try and get someone externally is very risky given that Disney has a very strong and unique culture, an external candidate might be a bad fit for that."", ""So there is a lot of pressure on the board to find a successor to Iger. I think there was before Peltz raised his hand. I think there is after Peltz has moved on. And that is something that I think investors-- I think right now, 2026 still seems like it's far away. So if you're investors, you're sort of looking at the optimistic outlook for earnings this year and some of the things Disney announced on their last call, like the sports JV and can be excited about that. But as you get closer to 2026, that's going to be more and more of an overhang on shares.""]"

Peltz played a curmudgeon, complaining about movies with too many women and Black people.

As Yale’s Jeffrey Sonnenfeld and Steven Tian note, Peltz’s knack for pumping up a share price during a proxy battle has not historically increased a stock’s long-term value.', ""What does increase value is the kind of transformational leadership that Iger has demonstrated throughout his career. That means getting ahead of technology and consumption trends and being the kind of company where employees want to work. It's tricky to speak up on issues like abortion and anti-LGBTQ+ legislation in this polarized climate. As a major employer in Florida and a company that has targeted its products to a diverse range of customers, Disney was forced to take a public stance when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the “Don’t Say Gay” bill—spawning a two-year battle that was finally settled last week."", 'As an $89 billion-a-year giant, Disney can also afford to take on well-funded warriors like Peltz and DeSantis in a way that most companies can’t. The company said it spent almost $40 million just to defend its shareholder slate against Peltz.', 'To leadership consultant Bill Schaninger, that’s money well spent. “They have to be on the right side of history for Disney’s brand and employees,” says Schaninger, who led the global talent practice at McKinsey before becoming senior partner at Modern Executive Solutions. “In the long game, you win out as an employer and a company when you’re committed to diversity.”', 'Schaninger advises leaders at large public companies to double down on defending their commitment to ESG practices. In a polarizing political environment, the key is to do it in a different way. “Syndicate the risk with your board,” he says, “Engage your lead outside director in a conversation about ‘What do we stand for?’” Have those conversations with employees and large investors, reiterating core values in an arena where you don’t have to shout them at someone who’s weaponizing politics—left or right—to defeat you. And accept that being one of the biggest kids on the playground gives you a responsibility to stand up for those who can’t.', 'More news below.', 'Diane Bradydiane.brady@fortune.com', 'This story was originally featured on Fortune.com']"

Why United Rentals (URI) is a Great Choice,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-top-momentum-pick-why-160010455.html,1712246410,STORY,['URI'],"['Momentum investing is all about the idea of following a stock\'s recent trend, which can be in either direction. In the \'long\' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'While many investors like to look for momentum in stocks, this can be very tough to define. There is a lot of debate surrounding which metrics are the best to focus on and which are poor quality indicators of future performance. The Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at United Rentals (URI), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. United Rentals currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period."", 'You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>', 'Set to Beat the Market?', ""Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for URI that show why this equipment rental company shows promise as a solid momentum pick."", ""A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area."", ""For URI, shares are up 0.96% over the past week while the Zacks Building Products - Miscellaneous industry is up 1.18% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 4.33% compares favorably with the industry's 2.55% performance as well."", 'While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of United Rentals have increased 28.46% over the past quarter, and have gained 101.03% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 11.19% and 28.22%, respectively.', ""Investors should also take note of URI's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. Right now, URI is averaging 499,476 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', ""The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with URI."", ""Over the past two months, 2 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost URI's consensus estimate, increasing from $42.84 to $43.08 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 1 estimate has moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Given these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that URI is a #2 (Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep United Rentals on your short list."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

As of the closing bell on March 28, 2024, the S&P 500 had gained in the neighborhood of 34,400%, including dividends paid, since Buffett took the reins. In comparison, the affably named ""Oracle of Omaha"" has overseen a jaw-dropping aggregate return in his company\'s Class A shares (BRK.A) of 5,126,746% since the mid-1960s!', ""Both professional and retail investors frequently await Berkshire's quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to gain an understanding of what stocks Buffett and his top investment aides, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, have been buying and selling. While Buffett is just as fallible as any other investor, he's demonstrated a knack for finding value in plain sight."", 'Something else Warren Buffett is known for is portfolio concentration. Even though the Oracle of Omaha and his team are overseeing a $373 billion portfolio containing 45 stocks and two index funds, the vast majority of Berkshire\'s invested assets have been put to work in just a few companies -- the ""top ideas.""', ""While 13Fs would give investors the impression that tech titan Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is Buffett's unquestioned favorite stock -- Berkshire's Apple stake accounts for 42% ($155 billion) of invested assets -- a deeper dive into how Berkshire Hathaway puts its cash to work points to another even more beloved stock as the Oracle's cream of the crop."", 'Let me preface this discussion by noting that Warren Buffett and his team of investors absolutely love Apple as a business. In fact, Buffett himself described Apple as ""a better business than any we own"" during Berkshire Hathaway\'s annual shareholder meeting last year. It\'s why an estimated $36 billion has been put to work by Buffett and Co. in shares of Apple since the start of 2016.', ""There are plenty of reasons for Buffett to feel the way he does about Apple. To start with, it's one of the most valuable brands globally, and it sports an exceptionally loyal customer base. A brand study conducted by SellCell.com in March 2021 notes that iPhone users are more likely to stick with Apple for their next smartphone purchase than Samsung owners are to buy another Samsung smartphone."", ""There's also the domestic dominance of Apple's iPhone. Since introducing an iPhone that supports 5G speeds in the fourth quarter of 2020, Apple has consistently accounted for a 50% or greater share of the U.S. smartphone market."", ""However, the company's future growth boils down to its shift to subscription services. Although Apple has no intention of abandoning the physical products that brought it fame (the iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple Watch), focusing on subscription services should provide a lift to its operating margin, enhance the value of its product and service ecosystem, and keep customers loyal to its brand."", ""But if you asked Warren Buffett to pinpoint the one aspect about Apple he loves most, it wouldn't be the least bit surprising if he flagged Apple's market-leading share repurchase program. Since initiating a buyback program in 2013, Apple has bought back about $651 billion worth of its common stock. Not only do buybacks help reduce the number of shares outstanding, which can provide a lift to earnings per share (EPS), they're a means to increase the ownership stakes of existing shareholders. As time passes, Berkshire is becoming a larger stakeholder in Apple without having to buy a single share."", 'But the fact remains that the estimated $36 billion Warren Buffett and his team have put to work in Apple over the past eight years takes a back seat to an even more loved stock.', ""Truth be told, Berkshire Hathaway's 13Fs fail to tell the full story about the company's holdings or what the Oracle of Omaha has been doing with Berkshire's cash. For a more encompassing view, investors will need to dive into Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly operating results."", ""Just prior to the executive certifications at the end of Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly earnings reports is a section on the company's share repurchase activity. The reason I bring this up is because Warren Buffett has spent considerably more buying back Berkshire Hathaway stock than he and his top aides have spent purchasing shares of any other stock, including Apple."", 'During the December-ended quarter, Buffett gave the green light for the repurchase of 3,623 shares of Berkshire\'s Class A stock and 660,585 shares of Class B stock (BRK.B), which came at a cost of almost $2.15 billion. Since the midpoint of 2018, Buffett and his late right-hand man, Charlie Munger, who he referred to as the ""Architect of Berkshire Hathaway"" in his latest annual letter to shareholders, OK\'d the repurchase of more than $74 billion worth of their own company\'s shares. That\'s more than twice the amount spent buying shares of Apple.', ""Prior to July 2018, Berkshire's share repurchase program only allowed the Oracle of Omaha to buy shares of his company if they traded at or below 120% of book value (no more than 20% of reported book value in the most recent quarter). Since Berkshire stock never fell to or below this threshold, Warren Buffett was forced to sit on his hands and go years without repurchasing a single share."", ""On July 17, 2018, Berkshire's board reworked its buyback criteria:"", 'As long as Berkshire Hathaway has at least $30 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries on its balance sheet; and', 'Warren Buffett and the late Charlie Munger agree their stock is intrinsically cheap, buybacks can be made without any end date or ceiling.', ""Suffice it to say, more than $74 billion in share repurchases over the last 22 quarters makes it plainly obvious that Berkshire Hathaway is Warren Buffett's favorite stock to buy."", ""Since Buffett's company doesn't pay a dividend, share buybacks are the easiest way he can reward investors who share his long-term vision. These buybacks are slowly but steadily increasing the ownership stakes of Berkshire's shareholders, as well as increasing EPS. In other words, putting his company's cash to work via buybacks is making Berkshire Hathaway more attractive to fundamentally focused investors."", 'With a record $167.6 billion in available cash, cash equivalents, and Treasuries on the balance sheet, as of the end of 2023, Buffett has more than enough firepower to continue buying back shares of his company.', 'Before you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

Sales are doubling in spite of supply shortages as the company works closely with Nvidia to build customizable servers for its AI customers."", ""CEO Charles Liang said on the most recent earnings call that demand is still outstripping supply and that the company would be able to ship more product if supply improves -- and it is improving.

Micron's recent second-quarter earnings report showed it has clearly turned the corner."", 'Revenue jumped 58% to $5.8 billion, and Micron flipped a wide loss in the year-ago quarter to an operating profit of $191 million. The company also called out AI as a key demand driver as CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said, ""We believe Micron is one of the biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry of the multiyear opportunity enabled by AI.""', ""As Mehrotra explained on the earnings call, surging demand for AI servers is driving growth in high-bandwidth memory and data center solid-state drives, which is tightening the supply of memory chips, leading to increased prices for Micron's products."", 'It expects that trend to continue and is forecasting record revenue in fiscal 2025 with a significant improvement in profitability.', ""Micron is still cheaper than most other AI chip stocks, and if it can ramp up sales and take advantage of rising demand, the stock should continue moving higher.

(NASDAQ:HAS) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.70 per share on the 15th of May. Based on this payment, the dividend yield on the company's stock will be 5.1%, which is an attractive boost to shareholder returns."", ' Check out our latest analysis for Hasbro ', 'While it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Even while not generating a profit, Hasbro is paying out most of its free cash flows as a dividend. Generally it is unsustainable for a company to be paying a dividend while unprofitable, and with limited reinvestment into the business growth may be slow.', ""Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise exponentially over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 13%, so there isn't too much pressure on the dividend."", ""Even over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2014, the annual payment back then was $1.60, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.80. This works out to be a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 5.8% a year over that time. The dividend has been growing very nicely for a number of years, and has given its shareholders some nice income in their portfolios."", ""Investors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. However, things aren't all that rosy. Hasbro's earnings per share has shrunk at 41% a year over the past five years. Such rapid declines definitely have the potential to constrain dividend payments if the trend continues into the future. Over the next year, however, earnings are actually predicted to rise, but we would still be cautious until a track record of earnings growth can be built."", ""Overall, we don't think this company makes a great dividend stock, even though the dividend wasn't cut this year. We can't deny that the payments have been very stable, but we are a little bit worried about the very high payout ratio. We would be a touch cautious of relying on this stock primarily for the dividend income."", ""Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance. Case in point: We've spotted 2 warning signs for Hasbro (of which 1 doesn't sit too well with us!) you should know about. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

The gains were baked on the fires of a game-changing collaboration with another food-service veteran -- mighty McDonald's (NYSE: MCD)."", ""In a joint press release, Krispy Kreme and McDonald's announced the expansion of a small-scale test project. What started in the fall of 2022 as a nine-store distribution test in Louisville expanded to 160 Kentucky locations last summer, and now they're going nationwide. Three classic Krispy Kreme donuts will become widely available at McDonald's restaurants over time, aiming to cover the whole store network by the end of 2026."", ""Krispy Kreme stores nearby will deliver freshly baked donuts every morning, available as single-pastry snacks or half-dozen boxes. This deal more than doubles the locations in Krispy Kreme's overall distribution network."", ""The rollout will take time because Krispy Kreme's store chain is far smaller than McDonalds' network. With 224 American donut-making hubs serving up daily treats to 11,900 Krispy Kreme stores and partner locations, the company runs an expandable, asset-light production model. Still, adding more than 13,500 McDonald's restaurants to this system can't be done overnight."", ""Krispy Kreme's shares closed 39% higher on the day after this announcement, while McDonald's stock gained 1%. The excitement faded a bit in the following days, but Krispy Kreme still enjoyed an 18% gain in March as a whole. The donut shop is currently unprofitable and burned more cash than it made in three of the last four quarters."", ""The McDonald's agreement could boost the company's bottom line in the long run, but the expansion effort will probably be expensive at first. Further financial details are coming up as the two partners work out the details of their entwined operations."", 'And I can\'t help pointing out that McDonald\'s has a history of trying new menu ideas only to cancel them a few years later. The ""signature crafted recipes"" burgers spring to mind, next to the all-day breakfast idea. I hope Krispy Kreme has a Plan B ready in case McDonald\'s backs out of this agreement someday. In particular, the donut chain shouldn\'t spend too much money on sweetening up its production hubs.', ""So it's a promising partnership between two popular brands\xa0but also a risky one -- best enjoyed with a double coffee and a large pinch of salt."", 'Before you buy stock in Krispy Kreme, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Krispy Kreme wasn’t one of them.

In the \'long\' context, investors will essentially be ""buying high, but hoping to sell even higher."" And for investors following this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock\'s price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving in that direction. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.', 'Even though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.', 'Below, we take a look at Pentair plc (PNR), which currently has a Momentum Style Score of B. We also discuss some of the main drivers of the Momentum Style Score, like price change and earnings estimate revisions.', ""It's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Pentair plc currently has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period."", 'You can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>', 'Set to Beat the Market?', ""Let's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for PNR that show why this company shows promise as a solid momentum pick."", ""A good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area."", ""For PNR, shares are up 1.79% over the past week while the Zacks Manufacturing - Thermal Products industry is up 1.95% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 5.42% compares favorably with the industry's 4.34% performance as well."", 'While any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Over the past quarter, shares of Pentair plc have risen 17.98%, and are up 59.52% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 11.19% and 28.22%, respectively.', ""Investors should also pay attention to PNR's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. PNR is currently averaging 1,623,873 shares for the last 20 days."", 'Earnings Outlook', ""The Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with PNR."", ""Over the past two months, 1 earnings estimate moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost PNR's consensus estimate, increasing from $4.21 to $4.22 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 2 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period."", 'Bottom Line', ""Taking into account all of these elements, it should come as no surprise that PNR is a #2 (Buy) stock with a Momentum Score of B. If you've been searching for a fresh pick that's set to rise in the near-term, make sure to keep Pentair plc on your short list."", 'Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For example, when markets were wavering amid the coronavirus crisis, insiders started piling into stocks like crazy in March 2020. In just about 20 days insiders bought $1.19 billion in company shares. Later events proved that they were right. Markets were quick to roar back to new highs driven by stimulus packages and rising consumer spending. Insiders were also selling in November 2021, when the Federal Reserve was getting ready to start cutting interest rates.', 'But should you always look towards insider sentiment to guess what’s coming next. Are insider bets always right?\xa0 Some data points show that if you keep paying attention to insider sentiment without incorporating outlier or black swan events, you’d face surprising results. In January 2023, for example, the Wall Street Journal said in a report that insiders were not expecting a rebound because they weren’t buying shares of their own companies. The Journal’s analysis at that time was based on insider buying to selling ratio which ticked up in June 2022 but then started to decline without any major increases. The report at the time also cited Nejat Seyhun, a finance professor at the University of Michigan, who was worried that insiders were not buying despite prices coming down to very low levels. Seyhun said that this indicator was a “warning” about things to come. The WSJ report also said that insider sentiment started to decline in November and December 2021 since in these two months shares of “almost twice as many companies were sold by insiders as were bought.”', 'But were insiders right? The S&P 500 at the end of January 2023, when insider sentiment was down, was at 3,824.14, while it ended the year at 4,769.83. The AI-led rally that surprised the financial markets was really an outlier event and we are still seeing its effects without any end in sight.', 'Similarly, in May 2022, insiders were brushing aside recession warnings and piling into stocks. Bloomberg, citing The\xa0Washington Service, at the time reported that 1,100 corporate executives and officers had bought their company shares in May through May 23. The S&P 500 closed the month of May at 4,132, while at the end of the year it was at 3,893.', 'Currently, the overall Insider Buy/Sell ratio is 0.23, which is quite low and shows that insiders are not bullish on the short-term future. And this isn’t unexpected. Many analysts are expecting a wider market pullback in the short term since they believe the AI-led rally has gone too far and stocks need a breather. They have been questioning the valuations of large-cap tech stocks. Some analysts however believe the AI rally would now broaden to smaller companies.', 'Let’s take a look at how insider sentiment-focused investing strategies have been performing in the recent past. AdvisorShares Insider Advantage ETF (SURE), which invests in companies “reducing their equity float through buyback programs and insider buying,” is up 10.6% year to date, compared to the 8.5% gain posted by the S&P 500 in the same period. Over the past one year the ETF is up 30%.', 'Another testament to the effectiveness of keeping an eye on insider trading is the returns posted by Insider Monkey’s monthly newsletter and portfolio that focuses on activist hedge funds, insider trading and stock picks from hedge fund investor newsletters and conferences. The portfolio returned 199.2% between March 2017 and March 12, 2024 and outperformed the S&P 500 ETFs’ 144.9% gain by more than 54 percentage points.', 'Insider Monkey’s analysis of insider buying and selling activity over the past few days shows that insiders are dumping technology stocks in droves. Out of the 83 important insider selling transactions since the start of this month, 26 were related to technology companies. When it comes to insider buying, financials stocks took the lead with 29 insider buys over the past week, followed by healthcare. This was also expected since analysts have been recommending investors to look beyond technology stocks and pile into healthcare, financials and utilities amid low valuations and rate cut expectations.', 'Luis Louro / shutterstock.com', 'Methodology', ""For this article we first used a stock screener to identify stocks with PE ratios over 50. From these stocks we chose 11 stocks that recently saw heavy insider selling activity. To find details of insider selling transactions we used Insider Monkey's insider trading stock screener.

We all want a safer, more reliable and higher-performing railroad with a substantially greater share price. Unfortunately, the Board and CEO Alan Shaw continue to take actions that place their self-preservation ahead of our shared goal. The most recent example of this is their decision to enter into a costly and opaque agreement to extricate John Orr from Canadian Pacific Kansas City Limited (""CPKC"") and make him the third COO in two and a half years under Mr. Shaw. They did this to try to lend some semblance of credibility to their sudden embrace of scheduled railroading and repeatedly updated guidance, which we deem unattainable with the Company’s existing infrastructure and marketing-centric leadership still in place.', 'Here are just a few of the key points you need to know about this latest failure of governance:', 'The Board\'s reactive process for hiring a COO was run from a position of weakness and did not even include a discussion with our proposed candidate, Jamie Boychuk, who helped CSX Corporation (""CSX"") outperform Norfolk Southern on every key railroading metric during his tenure as EVP of Operations.', 'Based on Norfolk Southern’s own disclosures and statements regarding the importance of the Meridian Speedway and Terminal, we estimate the undisclosed consideration paid by the Company to hire Mr. Orr as COO may far exceed the $84 million paid by CSX to hire industry legend Hunter Harrison as CEO.', 'In addition to depriving shareholders of the same type of vote that CSX held when it paid $84 million for Mr. Harrison, the Board and Mr. Shaw have failed to disclose all of the relevant details about Norfolk Southern’s agreement with CPKC.', 'The Board did not aggressively search for or hire a COO with important experience at an Eastern Class I railroad, but rather one of convenience with ties to current director Claude Mongeau.', 'The Board did not hire a COO with expertise in Precision Scheduled Railroading (""PSR"") implementations; to the contrary, one of our nominees – Sameh Fahmy – joined Kansas City Southern in 2019 as EVP of PSR to lead the successful network transformation that Mr. Orr (who joined in April 2021) erroneously claims credit for.', 'Mr. Orr has been accused of abusive behavior and serious misconduct in the workplace, according to legal filings found by Ancora and interviews Ancora has conducted with executives in the industry.', 'Concerns about Mr. Orr’s workplace behavior at Canadian National Railway Company (""Canadian National"") should have been known to the Board based on our private warning and the fact that one of Norfolk Southern’s current directors, Mr. Mongeau, was CEO of Canadian National for years.', 'The only industry endorsements for Mr. Orr since his appointment as COO have come from Mr. Mongeau and individuals at CPKC, which just received massive financial and strategic consideration from Norfolk Southern in exchange for Mr. Orr.', 'It is important to stress that Ancora warned the Board about Mr. Orr’s history and the pitfalls of taking a costly, hasty action on the eve of an election contest. The Board ultimately rejected our private warning in favor of paying outsized and poorly disclosed consideration to CPKC – without shareholder approval – to hire a COO who lacks the necessary qualifications. At this year’s Annual Meeting, we intend to hold the Board accountable for its self-serving gambit.', 'In the meantime, we want to provide evidence of the Board’s poor judgment. We will not sit quietly as Norfolk Southern brazenly contends that one highly questionable hire is the primary cure for the strategic, operational and cultural issues that exist under incumbent leadership. We have worked with experts in corporate governance, disclosure and railroad sector compensation to analyze the Board’s decisions. We have also conducted a review of Mr. Orr’s past behavior, leadership style and track record, similar to the type of rigorous background searches that credible boards of directors and CEOs carry out when diligencing a possible senior hire.', '1. The Board and Mr. Shaw provided CPKC with excessive financial and strategic consideration that weakens Norfolk Southern’s long-term competitive positioning.', 'Norfolk Southern agreed to pay $25 million in cash and give up part of the Company’s franchise – in the form of concessions related to the Meridian assets – to hire an individual whose most recent role at CPKC was just eliminated altogether. Norfolk Southern neglected to remind shareholders in its sparse disclosures pertaining to the arrangement that the Company invested approximately $300 million for a 30% stake in the Meridian assets in 2006, suggesting a net present value of significantly more for Meridian in 2024. Granting the cash and undisclosed concessions to a competitor essentially allows Norfolk Southern to hire a single executive with questionable qualifications while permitting CPKC to leverage the concessions according to its own plans. For example, it is publicly disclosed that CPKC is separately pursuing a transaction with CSX involving the Meridian & Bigbee Railroad.1 Notably, one right that stands out to us from public disclosures is Norfolk Southern’s right to purchase valuable assets, which we are concerned may have been implicated by the concessions given up in the deal for Mr. Orr.', 'When Norfolk Southern and CPKC’s predecessor entered into their joint venture, public disclosures to the Surface Transportation Board show that the Company obtained the option to purchase the Wylie Intermodal Terminal in Texas in May 2024.2 In the wake of the deal to secure Mr. Orr, we do not expect Norfolk Southern to exercise that purchase right, meaning the Company will lose the opportunity to acquire the Wylie Intermodal Terminal. According to Norfolk Southern’s public submission to the Surface Transportation Board, the terminal handles 47% of the intermodal traffic from the Meridian Speedway (representing approximately 10% of Norfolk Southern’s intermodal volume). This implies the Board may have given away concessions to one of Norfolk Southern’s key competitive advantages pertaining to a critical area of its business.', 'It appears the prospect of securing a fleeting PR win in the form of Mr. Orr’s hire was enough to mitigate long-standing, substantive concerns regarding competitors’ expansion efforts. We highly doubt that the Board and Mr. Shaw would do a complete 180-degree turn if not for their focus on bolstering their hand in a contest.', '2. The Board and Mr. Shaw are unwilling to disclose the key details related to what seems to be a material agreement with CPKC.', 'Norfolk Southern’s most recent 10-K lists Birmingham to Meridian as one of its corridors with the heaviest freight volume. Moreover, Norfolk Southern previously told the Surface Transportation Board that ""[t]he Meridian-Wylie Route represents a significant component of NS’s commercial and operational offerings to intermodal customers.""3 The same submission also noted that ""NS intermodal shippers who utilize the reliable and fast service over the Meridian-Wylie Route are at risk of being forced to a much longer rail route or switch to highways, which would cause loss of efficient, competitive transportation options and significant harm to the public interest."" Despite the importance of the Meridian assets, Norfolk Southern provided just two sentences of description about vague concessions in its nearly 1,800-word press release on Mr. Orr’s appointment and then one paragraph of cherry-picked information in its second fight letter.', 'In the Company’s April 2nd letter, it states that the agreement with CPKC impacts approximately 1% of revenues. This equates to $120 million in annual revenue, which at a conservative 70% Operating Ratio translates to approximately $29 million in post-tax, full-year Operating Income. Based on a conservative 20x multiple, this amounts to $580 million in equity market value being impacted by the concessions. We do not understand how the Board, during an election contest, would not provide shareholders more information on such a material agreement.', 'Altogether, we estimate the $25 million cash payment and tangible concessions linked to the valuable Meridian assets represent a nine-figure cost in the coming years for Norfolk Southern. This means the immediate and estimated costs of hiring Mr. Orr far exceed the $84 million that CSX paid to hire an industry legend like Mr. Harrison, representing damning evidence of the Board’s poor judgment and focus on self-preservation.', '3. The Board and Mr. Shaw overlooked Mr. Orr’s weak credentials before subsequently embellishing his qualifications.', 'Norfolk Southern’s decision to hire Mr. Orr has not just deprived shareholders of the best available COO and strengthened other Class I railroads, but the Company has installed an individual with (i) very limited experience as an operations chief, (ii) no oversight role in any network-wide PSR implementation and (iii) no background at an Eastern Class I railroad. The fact is that Mr. Orr was appointed EVP of Operations at Kansas City Southern after it announced its merger with Canadian Pacific and years after Mr. Fahmy, our nominee, initiated the multi-year network transformation as EVP of PSR at Kansas City Southern. This means the Board’s claims that ""John shaped and guided precision scheduled railroading initiatives at KCS"" and that he ""[d]esigned and implemented a precision scheduled railroading strategy at KCS that improved safety, service, and productivity"" are outright misrepresentations.', 'Mr. Orr was passed over for the COO role upon the closing of the CPKC merger, and his subsequent role was eliminated altogether when he left CPKC last month. CPKC’s Keith Creel and Patrick Ottensmeyer endorsed Mr. Orr after their railroad received massive consideration from Norfolk Southern. In short, we believe that Norfolk Southern vastly overpaid for a candidate with weak credentials and a questionable workplace history.', '4. The Board and Mr. Shaw ran a reactive process that deliberately excluded highly qualified COO candidates – all to the detriment of shareholders.', 'After ardently defending former COO Paul Duncan, who was in his role for a little more than a year, we were shocked to see the Board throw Mr. Duncan under the bus and rush to bring in a third COO under Mr. Shaw. We were equally confounded by the decision to reject our multiple offers to speak with Mr. Boychuk, who was the EVP of Operations at CSX when it outperformed Norfolk Southern on every key railroading metric and delivered the best operating margins in the history of Eastern railroads. We question how the Board and Mr. Shaw can claim to be prioritizing shareholders’ interests when the COO replacement process deliberately excluded a potential candidate who has the respect of many analysts and shareholders. Unlike Mr. Orr, Mr. Boychuk has a background leading operations at an Eastern Class I railroad and recently overseeing a successful PSR implementation. Mr. Orr, on the other hand, was apparently a candidate of convenience because he previously worked under Mr. Mongeau at Canadian National.', 'At bottom, the Board and Mr. Shaw made an ill-timed and self-serving decision. Putting aside the availability of a superior candidate in Mr. Boychuk, Norfolk Southern was not in a good position to attract high-quality COO candidates and negotiate from a position of strength during a proxy contest. Norfolk Southern operated from a position of desperation, and shareholders and other stakeholders now stand to pay a steep price.', '5. The Board and Mr. Shaw disregarded the serious allegations levied against Mr. Orr.', 'During his tenure at Canadian National, legal filings in the public domain show that Mr. Orr was accused of abusive behavior and serious misconduct.4 An adjudicator appointed by the Canada Arbitration Board described such verbal abuse in detail, finding that ""Mr. Orr repeatedly threatened [REDACTED]’s job. He called her a ‘f-----g wuss’ ‘stupid b---h’ and ‘f-----g idiot.’ He said to [REDACTED] in front of [REDACTED] ‘Do you always need someone to hold your hand — can\'t you do your f-----g job?’ and similar comments which belittled her or threatened her job.""5 Mr. Orr denied the verbal abuse allegations, but the adjudicator found that evidence of verbal abuse by Mr. Orr was credible. The adjudicator found that the employee ""was belittled, had her job threatened, and was subjected to yelling and swearing"" to such an extent that ""no employee could be expected to persevere in employment in such circumstances.""6', 'Another complaint filed against Canadian National and Illinois Central Railroad was made by an African American employee, who held a management position and reported directly to Mr. Orr. The employee alleged racial discrimination, claiming that he was continually passed over for promotions in favor of Caucasian employees.7 Legal filings in the action allege ""Orr’s significant management flaws, including the malicious abuse of his subordinates.""8 In particular, the employee claimed ""Orr’s conduct was so bad that CN had to hire (for years and at a substantial expense) executive ‘coaches’ to counsel Orr on how to behave professionally in the workplace."" This same employee was also willing to testify ""that he had conversations with Orr about CN’s decision to transfer [the executive] to Memphis because he was Black.""9', 'Our representatives also spoke with a number of Mr. Orr’s former colleagues and subordinates, including certain employees whom he allegedly abused. All of these individuals agreed to speak with us voluntarily and without any compensation for their time. The responses further indicated reasons for concern about Mr. Orr’s behavior. One former female subordinate, who worked for Mr. Orr for years until his exit from Canadian National in 2019, stated that ""John Orr is racist, demeaning to women, especially women who don’t entertain his advances."" She and others indicated that they would provide sworn affidavits regarding Mr. Orr’s conduct. We do not understand how the Board and Mr. Shaw have decided to bet the Company’s future on Mr. Orr.', 'In closing, we recognize that many long-time railroaders have reputations for being rough around the edges. Industry legend Hunter Harrison, for example, was well known for being hot-tempered at times. However, there is a difference between being a hardnosed boss and stickler for precision, like Jamie Boychuk is, and having a history of alleged misconduct marked by legal actions, like John Orr does. There is no comparison between these two individuals – on any level.', 'As always, we remain open to an appropriate settlement with Norfolk Southern, provided it entails an orderly management transition and a reconstitution of a portion of the Board. This compromise would enable the Company to adopt our recommended leadership’s PSR-powered Scheduled Network, which can drive expedited improvements in Norfolk Southern’s lagging Operating Ratio and depressed share price. With or without Mr. Orr, Norfolk Southern will not be in a position to run this type of value-enhancing network if its current infrastructure and existing Board and CEO remain in place.', 'Hopefully, the Board continues to hear feedback from shareholders who support necessary changes in leadership and strategy. We, as Norfolk Southern’s owners, deserve much better than the status quo.', 'Regards,', 'Frederick D.

But for more than 125 years, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJINDICES: ^DJI) has been Wall Street's most-watched index."", ""At its official inception in May 1896, the Dow Jones was composed of a dozen predominantly industrial stocks. Today, it's a 30-component index packed with historically profitable, time-tested, brand-name businesses that have multinational appeal. In other words, it tends to be a stomping ground where investors of all walks can start their searches for foundational long-term holdings."", 'Although the Dow has a history of heading substantially higher over long periods, the outlook for its individual components can vary greatly. As we work our way into the heart of spring, two Dow stocks stand out as no-brainer buys in April, while another longtime constituent can be avoided like the plague.', 'The first Dow Jones stock that stands head-and-shoulders above its peers as a seemingly surefire buy in April is payment-processing company Visa (NYSE: V).', ""The only significant headwind current and prospective Visa shareholders should be mindful of in 2024 is the potential for a U.S. recession. A select group of indicators, including a notable decline in M2 money supply, suggest a heightened likelihood of an economic downturn in the not-too-distant future. When the U.S. economy slows down or contracts, consumers and businesses tend to spend less. That's not good news for a company like Visa that generates its revenue from merchant fees on transactions."", ""But there's a counter to this skepticism that's made patient investors considerably richer. Although recessions are a normal and unavoidable aspect of the economic cycle, they don't last long. Only three of the one dozen recessions in the U.S. since the end of World War II have stuck around for 12 months, with none surpassing 18 months. The U.S. and global economy spend a disproportionate amount of time expanding, which is favorable to Visa's operating model."", ""Speaking of things that are favorable, Visa is the undisputed market-share leader in credit card network purchase volume in the U.S., the world's No. 1 market for consumption. In fact, it's the only payment processor to gain a meaningful share following the Great Recession."", ""There's a lengthy opportunity for Visa to expand its reach into faster-growing emerging markets. Regions that remain underbanked, such as Southeastern Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, are ripe for disruption. Visa can enter these regions with its payment infrastructure organically or via acquisition and power its sales growth for decades to come."", ""If you need one more solid reason to buy into the Visa growth story, let it be the company's laser focus on payment facilitation. Though some of its peers also act as lenders and collect interest income, Visa's choice to steer clear of lending means it doesn't have to set aside capital to cover potential loan losses when economic downturns occur. Visa's flexible balance sheet and purposeful lending avoidance have helped it sustain a profit margin of greater than 50%."", 'A second Dow stock that makes for a phenomenal buy in April is none other than leading beverage company Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).', ""The reason Coca-Cola stock has badly lagged the gains of the major stock indexes (including the Dow) is simple: It's a mature business. During bull markets, it's not uncommon for investors to chase after higher-growth companies."", 'This has made Coke somewhat of an afterthought for the investment community. But forgetting about this time-tested company would be a mistake.', ""One factor Coca-Cola always has in its corner is that it's a consumer staples stock. Though consumer spending habits will shift depending on the health of the U.S. and global economy, things like food and beverages will be purchased in any economic climate. Since Coke provides a basic necessity good (beverages), its cash flow tends to be predictable and transparent year after year."", ""Something else that continues to work in Coca-Cola's favor is its virtually unparalleled geographic diversity. Except for North Korea, Cuba, and Russia (the latter is due to its invasion of Ukraine), it has ongoing operations in every country. This means it can take advantage of faster-growing emerging markets, while also generating predictable cash flow from developed countries. Coca-Cola has more than two dozen brands in its product portfolio generating at least $1 billion in annual sales."", ""Coca-Cola's marketing team deserves credit for its continued success, too. Last year, the company highlighted that it was spending north of 50% of its advertising budget on digital channels, as well as leaning on artificial intelligence (AI) to help tailor ads to individual consumers. But this is a company with more than a century of history in its back pocket. It regularly leans on its storied history to connect with more mature audiences."", ""Although Coca-Cola stock isn't going to double in a matter of months like some hypergrowth tech stocks, it delivers steady growth with minimal volatility -- it's about 41% less volatile than the benchmark S&P 500 -- and has increased its dividend in each of the past 62 years. Further, shares can be purchased for less than 20 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 15% discount to its trailing-five-year forward-earnings multiple."", ""On the other hand, not every Dow stock is going to be a winner. While an argument can be made that it's already taken its fair share of lumps in 2024, commercial airplane manufacturer and defense company Boeing (NYSE: BA) tops the list of Dow components to avoid like the plague."", 'Heading into 2024, Boeing was the top Dow component I highlighted to avoid. At the time, an even greater number of money-based metrics and predictive indicators were forecasting a high probability of a U.S. recession. Despite its hefty backlog of commercial orders, Boeing has historically been one of the worst-performing S&P 500 components during recessions. My expectation was that it would remain grounded if the U.S. economy cooled off or shifted into reverse.', 'Since the year began, Boeing has been clobbered by an assortment of missteps tied to its MAX jetliners. The most glaring of these incidences occurred in early January when a piece of fuselage on a 737 MAX 9 jetliner ripped out mid-flight. Boeing has admitted its fault in the incident and will need to clean up its production process to regain the trust of travelers and its customers.', ""Furthermore, Boeing CEO David Calhoun announced that he'd be stepping down from his post by the end of 2024. While a shake-up in the executive suite has been long overdue at Boeing, changes in leadership result in uncertainty. Wall Street isn't a fan of uncertainty, and Boeing's stock price shows it."", 'Federal Reserve monetary policy represents another potential hurdle for Boeing. The fastest rate-hiking cycle in four decades is a threat to the company on two fronts. First, it took on a significant amount of debt during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may make future refinancing costlier. The other issue is that higher interest rates may discourage airlines from making large purchases and updating their fleets.', ""Lastly, Boeing hasn't demonstrated an ability to stay on course with regard to profits or monthly production forecasts. Toward the tail-end of 2022, Wall Street pegged Boeing for a modest per-share profit in 2023. The company went on to lose $5.81 per share last year."", ""Likewise, Boeing was expected to earn over $5 per share in 2024. This estimate has since been pared down to a loss of $0.71 per share. Until Boeing actually delivers, it's a company worth avoiding."", 'Before you buy stock in Visa, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Visa wasn’t one of them.

(NYSE:WM), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. With 83% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.', 'Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.', ""Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Waste Management, beginning with the chart below."", ' See our latest analysis for Waste Management ', ""Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing."", 'As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Waste Management. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Waste Management, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.', ""Investors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Waste Management. The company's largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc., with ownership of 9.0%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 8.8% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 7.1% by the third-largest shareholder."", 'After doing some more digging, we found that the top 25 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.', ""Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too."", 'The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.', 'I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.', 'Our most recent data indicates that insiders own less than 1% of Waste Management, Inc.. Being so large, we would not expect insiders to own a large proportion of the stock. Collectively, they own US$153m of stock. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. ', ""The general public-- including retail investors -- own 17% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders."", 'While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks for example - Waste Management has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.', 'But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do.

282,4cd8b869-baa4-33d8-a88a-1c6525091a8f,VLO,2024-04-05,3 Oil Refining Stocks at All-Time Highs: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-oil-refining-stocks-time-121000556.html,1712232600,STORY,"['MPC', 'VLO', 'PSX']","[""Three refining companies that may be catching investors' attention in the Oil/Energy space are Valero Energy VLO, Marathon Petroleum MPC and Phillips 66 PSX. As a matter of fact, the stocks again made headlines on Wednesday after reaching fresh highs.VLO, MPC and PSX climbed to their all-time highs of $182.73, $218.59 and $173.55, respectively. On the day, each of them saw their share price increase about 2%. This jump marks a year-to-date ascent of somewhere between 30% and 45% for the operators."", ""Obviously, the recent rise in oil prices has played a key role in the abovementioned companies' surge. That's a big boon for VLO, MPC and PSX, given that it drives prices at the pumps.Oil prices rallied in the first quarter of 2024, with both Brent and West Texas Intermediate (“WTI”) crude futures registering significant increases. Brent oil, the global benchmark, rose nearly 14%, while WTI, which tracks U.S. crude, surged approximately 16% during the quarter. As of now, the global benchmark settled at $87.48 per barrel, while U.S. crude closed at $83.17 a barrel.Several factors contributed to the uptrend in oil prices. One significant driver was the ongoing production cut by major oil-producing nations, including Russia and members of the OPEC cartel. These cuts helped tighten the supply-demand dynamics in the market, leading to a reduction in global oil inventories.Since 2022, OPEC+ countries, led by Saudi Arabia and Russia, have implemented various production cuts to support oil prices as the market grapples with rising U.S. production and sluggish global demand. The latest round of voluntary cuts, which began in January, aimed to reduce combined production targets by approximately 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd).Last month, Saudi Arabia confirmed the decision to extend the voluntary cuts until the end of June. In a surprising move, Russia announced an additional voluntary cut of 471,000 bpd for the second quarter. This decision, along with the commitment from other key producers like Iraq and the UAE to extend their cuts, underscores the collective effort to stabilize oil markets.Geopolitical tensions also played a role in supporting oil prices. Escalating conflicts, such as the Russia-Ukraine war and the Israel-Palestine conflict, raised concerns about potential supply disruptions in key oil-producing regions. Additionally, attacks on ships in the Red Sea further heightened market anxieties, contributing to the bullish sentiment.Marathon Petroleum and other downstream operators also benefited from the surge in gasoline prices, as U.S. refiners completed planned maintenance activities. As a result, domestic refinery utilization rates have remained below 90% for an extended period, marking the longest duration of such low utilization in three years."", 'Image Source: Zacks Investment Research', 'Continuing the ascension of of Valero Energy, Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 shares were their favorable fourth-quarter results that widely surpassed the bottom-line expectations during the period.VLO’s Q4 earnings of $3.55 per share breezed past the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.95 a share by 20%. Similarly, MPC easily surpassed Q4 earnings expectations, with EPS at $3.98 per share and 69% above estimates of $2.36 a share. Meanwhile, quarterly EPS of $3.09 topped estimates by 30%.VLO, MPC and PSX stocks are part of the Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining & Marketing industry group, which ranks in the top 38% out of more than 250 Zacks Ranked Industries.

289,f10cc398-7455-3322-928d-72d32ad9d309,AAL,2024-04-05,Is United Airlines Undervalued?,GuruFocus.com,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/united-airlines-undervalued-140004138.html,1712239204,STORY,"['AC.TO', 'UAL', 'AAL', 'DAL', 'ALK']","['Based on most conventional metrics, United Airlines Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:UAL) is a cheap stock. Shares trade at a forward price-earnings ratio of 5 and a forward enterprise value/Ebitda ratio of 3.80. Comparably, the S&P 500 trades at roughly 22 times forward earnings.', 'The stock has a GF Value of roughly $67 per share, which represents a 37% premium to the share price at the time of writing. However, it may be cheap for a reason and further analysis is required.', 'Warning! GuruFocus has detected 1 Warning Sign with UAL.', 'The airline business is highly competitive. United competes with other U.S. airlines, including American Airlines (NASDAQ:AAL), Southwest Airlines (NYSE:LUV), Delta Airlines (NYSE:DAL), Alaska Air (NYSE:ALK), JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU) and Spirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE). The company also competes with foreign carries on international routes. The result is that the airline business tends to be a very low-margin business.', 'Air travel demand is highly cyclical and tends to be driven by economic trends. The high degree of cyclicality is especially challenging for airlines due to the high fixed-cost structure required to operate.', 'The airline business is a very capital-intensive as well since the companies are forced to invest substantial capital to maintain and operate fleets of airplanes. For 2023, United reported adjusted capital expenditures of roughly $7.90 billion, which represents approximately 15% of annual revenue.', 'The result of these factors is that United and other airlines have historically struggled to generate solid returns on invested capital.', 'United currently has adjusted net debt of roughly $24 billion and a net leverage ratio of 2.90 based on 2023 adjusted Ebitdar. This level of leverage is fairly high for any company, but is especially high for an extremely cyclical company.', ""The company is rated below investment grade, but was recently upgraded to BB- by Fitch and S&P. In its ratings upgrade, Fitch noted the company's credit metrics improved significantly during 2023."", ""Despite an improving credit profile, United remains highly levered. Its high degree of leverage has the potential to be problematic in the event of a serious economic downturn that results in a challenging operating environment. Additionally, United's high degree of leverage means it is exposed to potential increases in interest rates, which would require debt to be refinanced at higher levels."", 'United currently trades at a moderate discount to peers. It has a forward enterprise value/Ebitda ratio of 3.80. Comparably, Delta, American Airlines and Southwest have respective forward EV/Ebitda ratios of 5.10, 4.80 and 5.40. JetBlue and Spirit Airlines, two smaller carriers which have been struggling of late, trade at forward EV/Ebitda ratios of 8.40 and 6.40.', 'On a forward price-earnings ratio basis, United trades at just 5 times forward earnings per share. Comparably, Delta, American and Southwest respectively trade at 7.40 times, 6.20 times and 18.80 times forward earnings.', 'While the discount versus Southwest is warranted given it has a much healthier balance sheet, the discount versus Delta and American Airlines does not appear to be warranted, in my opinion.', ""United's net leverage ratio of roughly 2.90 is similar to Delta and better than American Airlines. In terms of revenue and earnings growth, the company is expected to deliver similar results to these two companies and faces similar risks. Additionally, United, Delta and American Airlines all have large frequent-flyer businesses, which represent a key source of value. For these reasons, I do not believe United's valuation discount in comparison to Delta and American is warranted."", 'One of the most valuable parts of United is its MileagePlus business. The way this business works is the company sells miles to credit card companies and other third-party partners while also purchasing some miles itself to offset member miles earned via flights.', ""In 2020, United used the MileagePlus business as collateral to help raise debt needed to allow it to navigate the Covid-19 pandemic's disruption. At that time, the business was valued at 12 times Ebitda, or nearly $22 billion, and produced roughly 34% Ebitda margins. It is a high-quality business due to its stable free cash flow generation and strong Ebitda margins."", ""In 2022, United explored selling part of its MileagePlus business to raise cash, but did not complete a transaction. At Citi's Global Industrial Tech & Mobility Conference, Chief Financial Officer Mike Leskinen suggested that monetization of the MileagePlus business is still possible:"", '""We have an incredible high-margin, asset-light growth business within United Airlines. And 2 of our competitors have similar businesses. And right now, those businesses are deeply, deeply undervalued. And if I cannot through disclosure help the capital markets recognize the value of Mileage Plus, we have other levers we can press to create shareholder value. But it is a compelling business and it is -- and you\'re going to have to stay tuned for our May 1 Investor Day. But there is -- there are even some more growth opportunities to this business that are unappreciated.', 'So we\'re going to try to educate the Street on those opportunities. We\'re going to show you results. We\'re going to segment out over time. So you can see the high-margin nature of the business and the growth trajectory of that business. And I think that will accrue to shareholders. If it doesn\'t, we\'ll do something more aggressive.""', 'While it is difficult to predict what more aggressive actions the company may be contemplating, I think two potential options include a minority sale stake to a private equity investor or a spinoff of the MileagePlus business in which United maintains majority control. Such a transaction does not come without precedent as Air Canada spun off its mileage business via a 2005 initial public offering. However, Air Canada ultimately repurchased the business in 2019.', 'I would view a spinoff or minority stake sale in the MileagePlus business as a major positive for shareholders as it represents a way for the company to unlock value.', ""One key risk to consider is that United faces is potential regulations following a series of safety-related issues. CEO Scott Kirby has already sent a memo to customers reassuring them that safety is the airline's top prioritym but regulators remain concerned. The Federal Aviation Administration is said to be considering implementing restrictions, such as limiting United from adding new routes or restricting the company's ability to fly passengers on newly delivered aircraft."", 'Additionally, United Airlines has heavy exposure to the Boeing (NYSE:BA) 737 MAX aircraft. It is the largest operator of the 737 MAX planes, which account for 8% of its total capacity. In addition to this, the company also has a significant amount of 737 MAX orders which have already been placed. The company is expected to take delivery of 100 737 MAX planes in 2024 and an additional 201 737 MAX planes after 2024.', ""Flights of the aircraft have recently resumed after being grounded following a recent door plug blowout incident on Alaska Airlines (NYSE:ALK). Any future problems with Boeing's planes have the potential to pose a risk to United Airlines given the company's dependance on them."", 'I believe United Airlines should trade at a significant discount to the broader market given the challenging nature of the airline industry due to a mix of high competition, significant cyclicality, high fixed costs, high capital requirements and low historical returns on invested capital. However, I believe the current discount to the broader market is too large and United is undervalued at current levels.', 'The stock currently trades at a roughly 36% discount to the average valuation of close peers Delta and American Airlines based on forward price-earnings ratios. I do not find this discount to be warranted given the fact that United is fairly similar to Delta and American Airlines. All three airlines have similar near-term earnings growth prospects and are faced with the same industry challenges, along with highly levered balance sheets.', ""While it is possible that United becomes subject to potential regulatory restrictions, I think the impact of such restrictions will be limited and is unlikely to impact the company's long-term earnings potential."", ""Additionally, I view the recent comments by United's CFO regarding a potential monetization of MileagePlus as a key positive for the stock and a potential upside catalyst. Thus, I currently view United as moderately undervalued and an attractive investment opportunity relative to its peers."", 'This article first appeared on GuruFocus.']"

If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you may go to Top 10 Tax Friendly States for Retirees in 2024.', 'Are baby boomers financially secure? With almost all the baby boomers having reached the age of retirement, it’s quite a pertinent question to consider. The 23rd Annual Transamerica Retirement Survey, one of the largest surveys exploring the retirement outlook and healthy aging perspectives across different demographic segments, aims to shed some light on this issue. According to the survey, millions of Americans are in fact, ill-prepared for retirement, having to navigate everything between soaring inflation, the aftermath of the pandemic, economic uncertainty, and also the projected depletion of Social Security funds by 2034. Survey findings from Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFG) reveal some consequences of the same, stating how 26% of workers state they are now delaying retirement to deal with finances. As the last of the 73 million Baby Boomers turn 65 in the next decade, the retirement landscape in the States looks anything but promising.', '“You’re probably going to have an increase in the poverty rate. People are retiring, some quite early, and retiring with very little. Baby boomers just don’t have enough savings. And Social Security is just not gonna be that big for lots of people.”', 'Retirement planning evangelist Laurence Kotlikoff, a William Fairfield Warren Professor and a Boston University College of Arts & Sciences professor of economics.', 'Even though Social Security benefits aren’t meant to replace retirement income anyway, it has still been helping retirees from falling below the poverty line. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities reports that without SS benefits, 22.7 million more adults and children would be living below the poverty line. The most important demographic that these benefits are helping are older women and people of color, they note. As such, more than 17 million Americans aged 65 and above are economically insecure, living as much as at or below 200% of the federal poverty level (FPL).\xa0 As of January 2024, the average Social Security check for a retiree is $1,909. This amount is deemed insufficient when compared with the average retirement expenses of retirees which are around $4,345.', ""Going back to insights from the Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFG) survey, many respondents stated that they are postponing their retirement plans. However, it's important to note that not everyone falls into this category. Some aren’t delaying retirement, but are delaying something else instead. Anything from traveling to moving and even home repairs is being deferred by retirees to deal with finances, findings state. Another interesting finding from Principal Financial Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:PFG) is that those who are delaying retirement show a 52% increase in finding debt problematic than those who don't. These individuals also experience stress that is almost 50% higher. For those asking why, these individuals often lack financial confidence, and are more skeptical about their abilities to save and balance their emergency savings."", ""This brings us to the question: is delaying retirement always the right move? While it depends on your financial situation and it’s probably best to ask your financial advisor, a retirement delay may not always make more sense. In case it doesn't and you don't have a fat nest egg to lean on, it's probably wise to engage in alternative solutions, such as relocating to cheaper states. Many retirees often ask us, what is the most affordable state to retire in 2024? While there isn’t one single answer, there are quite many states to retire that are best for the cost of living and taxes. These states have the best tax structure for retirees and are often complemented with a lower cost of living than the national average."", 'For the retirees interested, here are the top 26 tax-friendly states for retirees in 2024:', 'Pixabay/Public Domain', 'To come up with our list of the top 26 tax-friendly states for retirees in 2024, we went back to our list of all the states that don’t tax Social Security in 2024. Next, we selected all states that had a ranking of 5(very tax-friendly) or 4(tax-friendly). This gave us 23 states for our list. Next, we ranked all the states that were “moderately tax-friendly” for retirees on their Average Combined State sales tax, property tax, and overall tax-friendliness. This gave us three more states. All these 26 states were ranked on their overall retirement tax-friendliness, sales, and property tax rates. Tax-friendliness has been taken from our previous articles, The Average Combined State sales tax rate is from the Tax Foundation, and the average effective property tax rate is from Property Shark. States have been ranked in ascending order from the lowest to the highest scores.

The company has delivered solid clinical progress and an important regulatory approval, and its financial results have generally been robust excluding its coronavirus antibody, whose sales are dropping.', ""However, every company, even the best ones, sometimes encounters headwinds. Regeneron is no exception. The drugmaker recently received a rejection letter from U.S. regulators regarding an application it submitted for one of its pipeline candidates. Let's look at what this means for the business and its shareholders."", 'Regeneron is looking to become a leader in developing cancer drugs. Oncology is one of the largest areas\xa0in the biotech industry and although it is highly competitive, there remains a dire need for newer and better therapies. Last year, Regeneron submitted an application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for odronextamab, a potential treatment for lymphoma.', 'The application was based on results from a phase 2 study during which odronextamab achieved a 73% complete response rate, with the objective response rate (the proportion of patients at least partially responding to treatment) coming in at 80%. Drugmakers typically request regulatory nods after phase 3 studies. But Regeneron decided to seek accelerated approval, which means that if odronextamab had been approved, the company would have had to run a confirmatory phase 3 trial.', ""The FDA decided to reject the application, citing issues with the enrollment status of Regeneron's confirmatory trial for odronextamab. The agency did not flag problems with the medicine's safety or efficacy. Still, Regeneron's shares dipped on the news. But long-term investors shouldn't care. Here's why."", ""If odronextamab had been expected to become a significant growth driver for Regeneron, the FDA rejection might have changed the company's fundamental thesis. But that's not the case. Though estimates vary, revenue projections for odronextamab aren't that impressive. Some expected the medicine to reach sales of $468 million by 2029. That's not bad, but it isn't huge, either -- not for a company the size of Regeneron. And odronextamab might still reach these peaks, just a little later. There is still a good chance the FDA will approve the medicine given there were no issues with safety or efficacy."", ""Meanwhile, Regeneron is awaiting approval for another investigational cancer medicine, linvoseltamab, a potential treatment for multiple myeloma. The FDA should decide to approve or reject Regeneron's application by late August. So the company's oncology hopes don't depend entirely on odronextamab."", ""Perhaps most importantly, Regeneron's most significant growth drivers -- eye medicine Eylea and eczema treatment Dupixent -- should continue to generate solid top-line growth. Last year, the company's revenue increased by 8% year over year to $13.12 billion. Minus its coronavirus portfolio, the top line rose 12%. Dupixent was Regeneron's biggest growth driver. It is currently seeking a label expansion for treating COPD that could come by late June."", ""That, combined with a much smaller negative impact from declining COVID-19 sales, should work wonders for Regeneron's sales growth this year. Furthermore, the company has several exciting candidates in the pipeline. Regeneron is looking to jump into the hot and fast-growing weight loss space."", ""The company is taking a different approach than most other drugmakers. Regeneron has emphasized the dramatic muscle loss patients experience when taking medicines like Wegovy.\xa0It is looking to develop drugs that can be taken in combination with GLP-1s like Wegovy to help patients keep their muscle mass (mostly) intact. Of course, Regeneron still has a long way to go in this area. But the point is, given its solid lineup and deep pipeline, the company's latest regulatory setback isn't a deal breaker -- far from it. Investors can still safely add this stock to their portfolios."", 'Before you buy stock in Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, consider this:', 'The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the\xa010 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Quest Diagnostics, it has a TSR of 62% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned.

Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index for February was up 0.3% month over month, in line with broad-based expectations. On a year-over-year basis, Core PCE increased 2.8%, which was way above the Fed’s 2% inflation target.This propelled the benchmark 10-year Treasury yields to their highest levels since November and dragged the equity markets down. Investors began to fret about its probable impact on the Federal Reserve’s next policy meeting in May, with the odds of a rate cut declining significantly.\xa0\xa0\xa0 \xa0Earlier, the Fed had pledged to cut interest rates several times in 2024 owing to a decelerating inflation trend in the later stages of 2023. However, given the recent inflationary data, the markets appear vulnerable to sudden downtrends. This, in turn, signifies that the markets need to brace for intense volatility owing to tempered expectations despite a relatively healthy U.S. economy and GDP data.Amid the uncertainty, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.This approach primarily tends to follow the adage, “the trend is your friend.” At its core, momentum investing is “buying high and selling higher.” It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. But before we delve deep into it, let us try to fathom why does the momentum strategy at all work?There are several behavioral biases that most investors exhibit in their decision-making. And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, make the momentum strategy work.For example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early. Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.Furthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.To sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.In this context, stocks like The Gap, Inc. GPS, Sterling Infrastructure, Inc. STRL and StoneCo Ltd. STNE are worth betting on.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child’s play.Here, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price.', ""Percentage Change in Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get the best stocks that have appreciated steadily over the past year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period.

Technology companies can especially play a crucial role in helping to reduce global emissions. According to a World Economic Forum (WEF) report published in 2023, ""Estimates reveal that the adoption of digital technology solutions in different sectors could help reduce global GHG emissions by 6-20 percent by 2030, depending on modeling scenarios and the sectors taken into account."" And besides the potential from innovation, there is also an expectation from investors, customers, and employees for companies to implement environmental initiatives and transparently report on their progress. Many regulators around the world are requiring companies to report on these initiatives as well. According to WEF, ""Stakeholders nowadays are pressing organizations to go beyond expectations, imagine a better way to do business, address environmental, social and governance (ESG) concerns concretely and transparently, and to set goals and report progress for business sustainability.""', 'Environmental reporting is an important part of this journey; it is how companies disclose their environmental impact and progress on sustainability efforts to stakeholders.

Setting clear public goals, measuring progress against them, and reporting on that progress is a best practice and, increasingly, a regulatory requirement. Not only does reporting help increase transparency and trust, but it also helps promote best practices and collaboration by demonstrating a more proactive approach to sustainability.', 'Changes in environmental reporting', 'Many companies have been voluntarily reporting on their environmental performance and progress against their goals for years. Companies have traditionally reported in two ways: by publishing their own public reports aligning with standard environmental reporting frameworks, such as the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and by submitting information to formal indices, raters, and rankers, such as CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project).', 'In recent years, we have seen a shift from voluntary reporting to mandatory reporting. The need for comparability, accountability, and defendable and auditable data and progress across companies contributes to this change.', 'For example, in the European Union, the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) modernizes and strengthens existing rules concerning the social and environmental information that companies have to report. The CSRD aims to ensure that investors and other stakeholders have access to the information they need to assess the impact of companies on people and the environment, and for investors to assess the financial risks and opportunities arising from climate change and other sustainability issues. A broader set of companies will now be required to report on sustainability, and companies subject to the CSRD will have to report according to European Sustainability Reporting Standards (ESRS).', 'Mandatory regulations are still evolving in many parts of the world. For example, in the United States, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) recently finalized a rule to enhance and standardize climate-related disclosures by public companies and in public offerings. And multiple jurisdictions around the world are actively pursuing or considering adoption roadmaps and pathways toward mandatory application of International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) IFRS® Sustainability Disclosure Standards (SDS).', 'Due to the urgency of climate change and the risks it poses, many companies recognize the importance of sustainability initiatives and transparent reporting regardless of the mandatory regulatory status. According to the WEF Global Risks Report, two-thirds of respondents rank extreme weather as the top risk most likely to present a material crisis on a global scale in 2024.', 'The future of environmental reporting', 'As we innovate in the climate space, there is also room to innovate on the way we approach environmental reporting.', 'Scenario modeling can help enhance the quality of environmental reporting by helping us gain a deeper understanding of potential future environmental impacts, risks, and opportunities such as climate change projections, regulatory changes, and advancements in technology.', 'Transition plans help companies gain a better understanding of how they intend to change their operations, practices, or business models to address environmental challenges. Robust scenario modeling can help project future performance against a defined baseline, and strategies and actions can be developed in response. In addition, these scenarios help us understand and make updates based on the latest climate science.', 'The complexity of the questionnaires and methodologies that raters and rankers (such as CDP, mentioned earlier) use to assess companies is growing. Reporting into these increasingly detailed frameworks relies on having quality data and estimations, which depends on a collective effort with customers, suppliers, and other partners to help gather the best data.', 'How Cisco approaches environmental reporting', 'Cisco has a long history of voluntary reporting on sustainability, and we want to continue to share our progress in an authentic and transparent way. To remain transparent, we publish an annual Purpose Report and maintain an ESG Reporting Hub. The report describes our commitments, goals, progress, and impact for the ESG topics that are important to our stakeholders from our most recent fiscal year. The ESG Reporting Hub includes in-depth information and historical data on all reporting topics.', ""Cisco's 2040 net-zero target and near- and long-term targets are approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) under its Net-Zero Standard, the world's first framework for corporate net-zero target setting in line with climate science. This builds on our history of setting meaningful goals, measuring our progress and impact, and reporting on them transparently."", ""Cisco is trusted in the IT space, and we are committed to maintaining that trust in our environmental reporting. Since quality reporting depends on a collective effort across the value chain to gather reliable data and estimations, we strive to influence our customers, suppliers, and partners to embrace robust reporting as well. For example, our suppliers are expected to report GHG emissions and energy consumption to CDP (a not-for-profit organization that runs a global disclosure system) on an annual basis. We know we must all work together to drive meaningful change for our planet's health and future generations. Likewise, a collective emphasis on clear and accurate reporting will help inform our efforts and measure the progress we are all making for the planet."", 'Learn more in our ESG Reporting Hub.', 'View original content here.', 'View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Cisco Systems Inc. on 3blmedia.com.', 'Contact Info:Spokesperson: Cisco Systems Inc.Website: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/cisco-systems-inc Email: info@3blmedia.com', 'SOURCE: Cisco Systems Inc.', 'View the original press release on accesswire.com']"
