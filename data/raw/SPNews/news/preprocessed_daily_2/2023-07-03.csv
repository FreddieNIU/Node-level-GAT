(NASDAQ:VRSK)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-verisk-analytics-inc-nasdaq-110035316.html,1688382035,STORY,['VRSK'],"[Verisk Analytics, Inc. (NASDAQ:VRSK) received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Verisk Analytics’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Verisk Analytics What's The Opportunity In Verisk Analytics?According to my price multiple model, where I compare the company's price-to-earnings ratio to the industry average, the stock currently looks expensive. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 43.69x is currently well-above the industry average of 22.27x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. Another thing to keep in mind is that Verisk Analytics’s share price is quite stable relative to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. This means that if you believe the current share price should move towards the levels of its industry peers over time, a low beta could suggest it is not likely to reach that level anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard for it to fall back down into an attractive buying range again.What does the future of Verisk Analytics look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 20% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Verisk Analytics. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in VRSK’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. At this current price, shareholders may be asking a different question – should I sell? If you believe VRSK should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on VRSK for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for VRSK, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

1,cb9c15fa-4e44-3d47-8616-b5275d47334f,SCHW,2023-07-03,20 Cities with Highest Elderly Population,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-cities-highest-elderly-population-121605547.html,1688386565,STORY,"['SCHW', 'OHI', 'BLK']","[In this article, we will take a look at 20 cities with highest elderly population. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis on the graying US population, and investor benefits, you may skip to 5 Cities with Highest Elderly Population.The Graying US PopulationMore than 55 million people across the USA are aged 65 or older, reports the US Census Bureau. With an increasing number of Baby Boomers reaching retirement age and older generations living longer, the US is graying drastically.This senior population is said to be burgeoning at 5 times the pace it had during the 100 years from 1920 to 2020. In 1920, the senior population was a mere 4.7% of the total population. In 2020, the population has reached 16.8% of the total count.To compare further, the US Census Bureau report highlights that no state had reached the threshold of 20% in 2010. However, 2020 has seen four states crossing this threshold. Maine is the state with the highest elderly population at 21.8%. Following Maine, the highest elderly population by state is in Florida, Vermont, and West Virginia, with 21.2%, 20.6%, and 20.5% seniors, respectively.With states graying rapidly in the US, so are many counties. Speaking of the highest elderly population by county, Sumter County in Florida has the highest senior population, with 58.9% comprising individuals aged 65 or older. Catron County, in New Mexico, ranks second in counties wit the highest elderly population, comprising 43.3% seniors. Charlotte County in Florida has 40.4% seniors, while Jefferson County in Washington has 39%. Whether its overall elderly population in the state or different counties, Florida takes the lead. It has many seniors, native and migrated, as it is one of the many states that don’t tax social security or pensions.Even though America may be graying at a rapid pace, statistics show that it is still younger than many developed countries. For instance, Japan has the largest share of older residents, at 28.5% of its population. Tokyo Kanto Metropolitan Area in Japan is the city with the oldest population in the world. Home to 8.7 million people aged 65 or older, seniors make up 23% of the city's total population. On the other hand, the USA only has 16.8% of older residents. When it comes to cities with the highest elderly population, Scottsdale, in Arizona, has the highest population of seniors, representing 24.6% of the total.Story continuesInvestor Benefits from an Aging PopulationA graying population, however, isn’t all bad news. In fact, a burgeoning older population can be fruitful for investors, notes CNBC. For instance, as more and more people are aging and retiring, the need for age-accessible housing is increasing too. As of 2011, only 11 million homes were age-ready for seniors. As a result, many seniors have had trouble accessing parts of their homes. Corporations such as Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (NYSE:OHI) and Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL) can help play a role in this matter. While Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL) is largely a diversified healthcare portfolio, it is also heavily focused on senior housing. Moreover, Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (NYSE:OHI) is one of the leading nursing home REITs.Yahoo notes that the senior housing industry will experience many years of demand growth exceeding supply growth, leading to occupancy of over 90% for the industry. As the senior population continues to age, increasing occupancy levels will push profit levels for the senior housing industry. As such, Omega Healthcare Investors, Inc. (NYSE:OHI), Welltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL), and similar others will likely experience double-digit funds from operations growth in the next decade.With the wealthiest generation in history beginning to draw their assets for funding retirement, other public companies to watch out for include Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK).Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), a global leader in financial services, helps people, institutions, and governments in raising, managing, and distributing the capital they need to achieve their goals. Similar to Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS), The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) provides a full range of brokerage, securities, money management, banking, and financial advisory services to people.Moreover, BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) is a preeminent asset management firm as well as a premier provider of investment management. Potential retirees can use services from The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) to raise their retirement funds. Similarly, these corporations are good stocks to invest in, too.An aging population is increasing the need for healthcare services as well. Healthcare stocks, on average, demonstrate 23% less volatility as compared to other stocks. As such, the best healthcare stocks to buy include UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and Horizon Therapeutics Public Limited Company (NASDAQ:HZNP).Regardless of the benefits of an aging population, it is a fact that such populations need to be adequately supported in an economy. Multiple strategies must be designed that can help sustain these populations and prepare them for their care better. The first step in this direction is to ascertain the places where population-graying is being felt the hardest. Highlighting cities, states, and counties with the highest elderly population is a right step in this direction.20 Cities with Highest Elderly PopulationMethodologyIn order to compile the list of cities with the highest elderly populations, we have used data from the US Census Bureau report “The Older Population: 2020”, amongst others. Cities having more than 100,000 population were selected for the rankings, with elderly population defined as seniors aged 65 or older. After compiling the cities with the highest elderly populations, we ranked them by percentage. Percentages have been sourced from the recent July 2022 population from the US Census Bureau. Places are ranked in ascending order from the lowest to the highest percentages of elderly population.Here are the top 20 cities with the highest elderly populations: 20.

2,ae83b75a-81d3-3efe-a642-42cafbe36ec2,TMO,2023-07-03,Estimating The Intrinsic Value Of Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/estimating-intrinsic-value-thermo-fisher-120209957.html,1688385729,STORY,['TMO'],"[Key InsightsThe projected fair value for Thermo Fisher Scientific is US$628 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to EquityCurrent share price of US$522 suggests Thermo Fisher Scientific is potentially trading close to its fair valueOur fair value estimate is similar to Thermo Fisher Scientific's analyst price target of US$628How far off is Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (NYSE:TMO) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.We generally believe that a company's value is the present value of all of the cash it will generate in the future. However, a DCF is just one valuation metric among many, and it is not without flaws. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. Check out our latest analysis for Thermo Fisher Scientific The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$8.68bUS$9.58bUS$10.9bUS$13.1bUS$14.4bUS$15.6bUS$16.5bUS$17.3bUS$18.0bUS$18.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x10Analyst x9Analyst x3Analyst x1Est @ 10.30%Est @ 7.84%Est @ 6.12%Est @ 4.92%Est @ 4.08%Est @ 3.49% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.0% US$8.0kUS$8.2kUS$8.7kUS$9.6kUS$9.8kUS$9.8kUS$9.7kUS$9.4kUS$9.1kUS$8.7k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$91bAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.0%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$19b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.0%– 2.1%) = US$325bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$325b÷ ( 1 + 8.0%)10= US$151bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$242b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$522, the company appears about fair value at a 17% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Thermo Fisher Scientific as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.0%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.987. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Thermo Fisher ScientificStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Life Sciences market.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow for the next 3 years.Current share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Next Steps:Whilst important, the DCF calculation shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

3,8c6eef04-0a62-394e-941b-58a8d6ef33b1,EW,2023-07-03,These 4 Measures Indicate That Edwards Lifesciences (NYSE:EW) Is Using Debt Safely,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-measures-indicate-edwards-lifesciences-110052956.html,1688382052,STORY,['EW'],"[Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. Importantly, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation (NYSE:EW) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Generally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Edwards Lifesciences How Much Debt Does Edwards Lifesciences Carry?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Edwards Lifesciences had US$596.5m in debt in March 2023; about the same as the year before. But it also has US$1.25b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$657.7m net cash.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Edwards Lifesciences' Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Edwards Lifesciences had liabilities of US$1.08b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$1.51b due beyond that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$1.25b and US$779.3m worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$555.7m.This state of affairs indicates that Edwards Lifesciences' balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$57.2b company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Edwards Lifesciences also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.Story continuesThe good news is that Edwards Lifesciences has increased its EBIT by 8.4% over twelve months, which should ease any concerns about debt repayment. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Edwards Lifesciences's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Edwards Lifesciences may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the most recent three years, Edwards Lifesciences recorded free cash flow worth 66% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.Summing UpWhile it is always sensible to look at a company's total liabilities, it is very reassuring that Edwards Lifesciences has US$657.7m in net cash. So is Edwards Lifesciences's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. Another factor that would give us confidence in Edwards Lifesciences would be if insiders have been buying shares: if you're conscious of that signal too,  you can find out instantly by clicking this link.At the end of the day, it's often better to focus on companies that are free from net debt.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the history of the food service industry, good party foods to buy, innovations in the supermarket shopping experience, challenges faced by the grocery industry, rise of online grocery shopping, and go directly to 5 Easy Party Snacks to Buy for Adults. Food service has developed and evolved over the centuries, with many new ways of preparing and serving food emerging in recent years. The first evidence of the food service industry can be traced back to the Sumerian period, in 3000 BC. In ancient Mohenjo-Daro, a recent excavation in Pakistan shows evidence that people ate in restaurant-type facilities that were equipped with stone ovens and stoves for quantity food preparation. In the following centuries, the food service industry grew rapidly and became an important part of the economy. Global caloric consumption has also grown as we have been able to drastically increase food production due to agricultural mechanization. As we mentioned in our article – 20 Most Profitable Food Businesses in the World – global caloric consumption will grow from 2,789 kilocalories in 2000 per person, to 3,139 kilocalories by 2050, an increase of 12%. Good Party Foods to Buy:Everyone enjoys a good party but party planning, on the other hand, may be quite a hassle. One of the easiest ways to glamorize your food is to plate it aesthetically. A beautiful garnishing will make even the most ordinary food look mouth-watering. Providing your guests with proteins by serving meat or seafood meals is always a good idea. You can find a lot of frozen food options that are easily prepared in a few minutes. Your guests would also need some flavorful crunchies to munch on, so make sure to have snacks like nuts, crackers, chips, or other salty finger foods. It’s also important to complement items from different snack categories with sauces, and other party dips and spreads. Story continuesIf you’re worried about what food to serve your guests, we have mentioned some great ideas in this list of Easy Store-Bought Party Snacks for Adults. Innovations in the Supermarket Shopping Experience: Despite the wave of digital transformation spreading throughout the retail sector, the supermarket shopping experience has largely remained the same. In the wake of the pandemic, online grocery shopping has certainly become more popular, but the majority of the people still prefer buying groceries at physical stores. Shopping carts are an essential part of the grocery shopping experience. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced in 2022 that it was launching its smart grocery carts at a Whole Foods store in Massachusetts. The Dash Cart, introduced in 2020, tracks and tallies up items as shoppers place them in the cart, enabling them to skip the checkout line. Voice-based ordering is another trend that the supermarkets are catching up on, by offering consumers the ability to order goods through their voice-assistants and pick them up in-store. For example, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) partnered with Google before the pandemic to offer customers the ability to order groceries through Google’s voice assistant. The Just Walk Out technology by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was perhaps the biggest leap in the supermarket shopping experience in recent years. The technology allows shoppers to identify themselves upon entering a store by scanning a QR code or their palms on a scanner. After that, they shop as usual and instead of checking out at a counter, they can simply walk out of the store. Their Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) accounts are billed automatically and they receive a digital receipt onlineChallenges Faced by the Grocery Industry:The grocery industry continues to face a number of challenges, such as rising supply chain costs, labor and raw material shortages, geopolitical conflicts, changes in consumer behavior and expectations, and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. Food prices are at an all-time high due to global inflation, with consumers reducing their overall spending. Grocery retailers today need to transform in order to navigate these challenges and meet consumer demands. Two of the largest supermarket chains in the U.S. hope to join forces as inflation pushes food prices higher. Grocery giant The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) announced plans last year to acquire Idaho-based Albertsons Companies, Inc. (NYSE:ACI) in a $24.6 billion deal. If it is approved by officials, the deal could reshape the U.S. supermarket landscape and create a corporate behemoth that collectively generates $209 billion in yearly revenue and operates nearly 5,000 stores. The acquisition, aimed, in part, to take on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), will allow the grocers to save millions in operating costs and have stronger bargaining power with suppliers. The complex deal would pay all shareholders of Albertsons Companies, Inc. (NYSE:ACI) $34.1 a share.Rise of Online Grocery Shopping: Over the past few years, e-commerce in the American grocery industry has continued to mature and scale, mainly accelerated because of the restrictions placed during the Covid-19 pandemic. According to a study by Verified Market Research, the U.S. online grocery market size was valued at $29.4 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $59.94 billion by 2030, with a solid CAGR of 9.31% from 2024 to 2030. The main drivers of e-commerce growth during the pandemic were convenience and safety, but research indicates that consumers also value the channel’s unique features, such as product comparisons, assortment, personalized promotions, and a growing preference for comfort.  Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was the big winner in 2022 as more and more people shifted to online grocery shopping, looking for ways to save a buck. Consumers were driven by what the researchers term ‘flight to value’, where they buy products via an ‘everyday low price’ pricing model employed at Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).With that said, let's head over to the list of the Easiest Party Snacks to Buy for Adults.   15 Easy Party Snacks to Buy for AdultsPixabay/Public DomainMethodology:To collect data for this article, we have referred to several sources, such as Dwell &amp; Dine, Real Simple, Greatist etc., looking for easy party snack ideas for adults.

After recording one of its worst periods last year, there is a sense of positive momentum in the market. Investors and market participants are witnessing a gradual rebound, with the overall sentiment becoming more optimistic. According to a Natixis Global Survey of individual investors, 68% of the surveyed individuals hold a positive view regarding their current financial situation. The study was conducted across 23 countries with 8,550 participants. That said, the S&amp;P 500 index is up 16.3% year-to-date and NASDAQ gained 32.7% so far, recovering from their all-time lows last year.Over the years, investors have actively sought out various investment strategies as a means to navigate potential market downturns and protect their portfolios. Generally, investors start with low-priced and penny stocks as an opportunity to enter the stock market with a smaller initial investment. The term ""penny stocks"" usually doesn't apply to well-established companies. Although there may be a few legitimate, multibillion-dollar companies with a stock price below $5 at times. For example, Lloyds Banking Group plc (NYSE:LYG) has a market cap of $36 billion and currently trades at a share price of $2.2 as of July 2. Similarly, many companies initially started as penny stocks and have experienced significant growth, emerging as major players in the stock market. For instance, investors who bought Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) in 1983 at $2.11 per share would have experienced substantial growth in their investment, as the stock price has multiplied several times since then. However, investing in penny stocks carries higher risks compared to investing in more established and larger companies.Story continuesAlso read: 10 Hot Penny Stocks To BuyPenny stocks that pay dividends can be attractive to some investors due to the potential for regular income.

The payment will take the dividend yield to 1.5%, which is in line with the average for the industry. Check out our latest analysis for Walmart Walmart's Dividend Is Well Covered By EarningsWe like a dividend to be consistent over the long term, so checking whether it is sustainable is important. The last dividend was quite easily covered by Walmart's earnings. This means that a large portion of its earnings are being retained to grow the business.Looking forward, earnings per share is forecast to rise by 83.1% over the next year. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 30%, which is in the range that makes us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendWalmart Has A Solid Track RecordEven over a long history of paying dividends, the company's distributions have been remarkably stable. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $1.88, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $2.28. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 1.9% over that duration. Dividends have grown relatively slowly, which is not great, but some investors may value the relative consistency of the dividend.Walmart Could Grow Its DividendThe company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Walmart has impressed us by growing EPS at 6.9% per year over the past five years. Since earnings per share is growing at an acceptable rate, and the payout policy is balanced, we think the company is positioning itself well to grow earnings and dividends in the future.Walmart Looks Like A Great Dividend StockIn summary, it is always positive to see the dividend being increased, and we are particularly pleased with its overall sustainability. Distributions are quite easily covered by earnings, which are also being converted to cash flows. All in all, this checks a lot of the boxes we look for when choosing an income stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock.

8,3f13a3aa-11ed-3452-8b3f-0e792e20572f,JWN,2023-07-03,"Should We Be Cautious About Nordstrom, Inc.'s (NYSE:JWN) ROE Of 3.6%?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/cautious-nordstrom-inc-nyse-jwn-131414343.html,1688303654,STORY,['JWN'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. We'll use ROE to examine Nordstrom, Inc. (NYSE:JWN), by way of a worked example.ROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for Nordstrom How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Nordstrom is:3.6% = US$20m ÷ US$551m (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.04 in profit.Does Nordstrom Have A Good Return On Equity?By comparing a company's ROE with its industry average, we can get a quick measure of how good it is. The limitation of this approach is that some companies are quite different from others, even within the same industry classification. As shown in the graphic below, Nordstrom has a lower ROE than the average (11%) in the Multiline Retail industry classification.roeThat's not what we like to see. Although, we think that a lower ROE could still mean that a company has the opportunity to better its returns with the use of leverage, provided its existing debt levels are low. A high debt company having a low ROE is a different story altogether and a risky investment in our books. You can see the 4 risks we have identified for Nordstrom by visiting our risks dashboard for free  on our platform here.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEMost companies need money -- from somewhere -- to grow their profits. That cash can come from retained earnings, issuing new shares (equity), or debt. In the first and second cases, the ROE will reflect this use of cash for investment in the business. In the latter case, the debt used for growth will improve returns, but won't affect the total equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesNordstrom's Debt And Its 3.6% ROEIt appears that Nordstrom makes extensive use of debt to improve its returns, because it has an alarmingly high debt to equity ratio of 5.19. The combination of a rather low ROE and high debt to equity is a negative, in our book.ConclusionReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. In our books, the highest quality companies have high return on equity, despite low debt. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But ROE is just one piece of a bigger puzzle, since high quality businesses often trade on high multiples of earnings. It is important to consider other factors, such as future profit growth -- and how much investment is required going forward. So you might want to take a peek at this data-rich interactive graph of forecasts for the company.If you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this free list of interesting companies, that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.Have feedback on this article?

9,fa1ff3e5-1de1-3f11-ace2-e51279a5f928,XYL,2023-07-03,Those who invested in Xylem (NYSE:XYL) three years ago are up 78%,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/those-invested-xylem-nyse-xyl-142358516.html,1688307838,STORY,['XYL'],"[By buying an index fund, you can roughly match the market return with ease. But if you choose individual stocks with prowess, you can make superior returns. For example, the Xylem Inc. (NYSE:XYL) share price is up 72% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 35% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 45% , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. Check out our latest analysis for Xylem While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.Xylem was able to grow its EPS at 1.0% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is lower than the 20% average annual increase in the share price. This suggests that, as the business progressed over the last few years, it gained the confidence of market participants. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth. This optimism is also reflected in the fairly generous P/E ratio of 54.68.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into Xylem's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of Xylem's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Xylem the TSR over the last 3 years was 78%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe're pleased to report that Xylem shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 45% over one year. And that does include the dividend. That's better than the annualised return of 12% over half a decade, implying that the company is doing better recently. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Xylem better, we need to consider many other factors. To that end, you should be aware of the   1 warning sign  we've spotted with Xylem .If you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

The cut, which took effect on Saturday, was initially planned to last for the month of July in an attempt to shore up oil prices.Russia’s Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak said that his country would voluntarily cut supplies by 500,000 barrels per day in August by cutting exports. Reuters reported, citing Novak’s office, that Russia would reduce production by that amount, deepening a cut of the same size Moscow implemented in March.The announcements sent prices for Brent crude, the global oil benchmark, up 0.7% to trade at $76 a barrel at 7.15 a.m. ET. WTI, the US benchmark, rose 0.8% to $71. Oil prices have fallen by more than 40% since March last year when they hit a 14-year high in the wake of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine.Saudi Arabia needs Brent crude to trade at around $81 a barrel in order to balance its budget, according to the International Monetary Fund. The kingdom has slipped back into a budget deficit this year after reporting a surplus in 2022 for the first time in almost a decade.The Gulf state first announced its 1-million barrel cut after a meeting in June between members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and other smaller producers, an alliance known as OPEC+.“This additional voluntary cut comes to reinforce the precautionary efforts made by OPEC+ countries with the aim of supporting the stability and balance of oil markets,” the Saudi Press Agency quoted an official source in the Ministry of Energy as saying Monday.At the June meeting, Riyadh also said it would extend a production cut of 500,000 barrels per day — first announced in April — to the end of next year. Taken together, the cuts will reduce Saudi Arabia’s total oil output to nine million barrels per day.Story continuesOther OPEC+ members have pledged to slash output through the end of 2024 amid a disappointing outlook for global demand, and as a strong post-pandemic rebound in the Chinese economy looks increasingly unlikely.Chinese factory survey data, released Monday, showed only modest growth in activity in the world’s second largest economy last month, with some firms cutting staff as sales came in weaker than expected.“Optimism around the 12-month outlook for production waned to an eight-month low in June, as some firms expressed concerns over relatively sluggish market conditions,” analysts at S&amp;P Global wrote in Monday’s report.For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com]"

As a mid-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, what if the stock is still a bargain? Let’s take a look at Flowserve’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. View our latest analysis for Flowserve What Is Flowserve Worth?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 2.6% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Flowserve today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $38.13, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Flowserve’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.Can we expect growth from Flowserve?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. With profit expected to grow by 36% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Flowserve. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? FLS’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough conviction to buy should the price fluctuates below the true value?Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on FLS, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth further examining other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you want to dive deeper into Flowserve, you'd also look into what risks it is currently facing.

Meanwhile, Apple is reportedly slashing its production targets for its Vision Pro headset and a major decision in San Francisco hangs over the future of Microsoft's megamerger with Activision Blizzard.1. Tesla deliveries trounce expectationsTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced that deliveries in the second quarter jumped to a record 466,140, in a sign that a decision by the electric carmaker's boss Elon Musk to slash vehicle prices may be boosting demand.The figure -- which is seen by shareholders as the closest proxy for sales that Tesla makes available -- was 83% higher than the same period last year. It also beat Bloomberg consensus expectations for shipments of 448,350.Earlier this year, the company unveiled discounts to help lift volumes, with Musk arguing that hefty price tags have dissuaded a ""vast number"" of potential buyers from purchasing a Tesla car.Austin, Texas-based Tesla is also pursuing new technology that it hopes will make its cars more affordable and help fend off increased competition in the market for clean energy-friendly automobiles.The stock zoomed higher by more than 6% in premarket trading on Monday.2. Futures mixed as second half of 2023 beginsU.S. stock futures were muted on Monday ahead of a shortened trading week, with investors looking ahead to the second half of a year that has already been marked by strong gains on Wall Street.At 05:11 ET (09:11 GMT), the Dow futures contract dipped by 36 points or 0.10%, S&amp;P 500 futures inched up 2 points or 0.06%, and Nasdaq 100 futures added 42 points or 0.27%.The main indices all posted increases in the opening six months of 2023. The standout performer was the Nasdaq Composite, which soared to its best first half since 1983 thanks in part to a surge in excitement over developments in artificial intelligence.Story continuesThe S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also climbed during the period.U.S. stock markets are set to shutter early at 13:00 ET on Monday for the Independence Day holiday. They will also be closed tomorrow.3. Apple scaling back Vision Pro production targets - FTApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is cutting its output goals for its mixed reality Vision Pro headset, according to the Financial Times, citing multiple people with knowledge of the situation.The product's complexity has already forced the tech giant to lower its production targets and push back plans for a more affordable version of the device, the paper said.Apple declined to comment to the FT, while Luxshare (SZ:002475) -- the Chinese firm contracted to assemble the Vision Pro -- did not respond to a request for comment.The Vision Pro was first unveiled on June 5 to great fanfare, with some observers arguing that the device has the potential to become as key to the company's success as its megapopular iPhone. Apple's valuation has since topped $3 trillion.But questions remain over how its hefty $3,500 price tag will impact demand. Apple has also said the Vision Pro will not be available for sale until early next year, a delay that some analysts have chalked up to supply chain issues.4. Major decision over Microsoft-Activision megamerger loomsThe fate of Microsoft's (NASDAQ:MSFT) planned $75 billion deal to acquire ""Call of Duty"" maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI) could be decided this week if a San Francisco court delivers an expected ruling on a Federal Trade Commission request to temporarily block the tie-up.The FTC is seeking a preliminary injunction that will prevent Microsoft from completing the merger until its own in-house administrative court can make a judgment on the agreement.Microsoft's lawyers and the FTC both presented their final arguments to a judge in a closely-watched hearing last week. The regulator has argued that the merger would hurt competition in the gaming market, a claim that Microsoft has refuted.According to legal experts cited by multiple news sources, the judge's ruling, which could come as soon as Monday, may decide the future of the deal.5. Oil choppy amid interest rate concerns, supply forecastsOil prices were volatile on Monday as traders eyed the possibility for more Federal Reserve interest rate hikes and the outlook for supply.According to analysts cited by Reuters, further increases in borrowing costs by the Fed, which is keen to bring inflation back down to its 2% target, could weigh on global economic activity and hit oil demand. The dollar may also be strengthened, which would in turn make commodities more expensive to buy for holders of other currencies.However, other analysts have argued that supplies will likely tighten later this year following a promise by key exporter Saudi Arabia to slash output in July.By 05:12 ET, U.S. crude futures traded 1.46% higher at $71.67 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed by 1.52% to $76.56 per barrel.Related ArticlesTesla deliveries, Vision Pro production targets - what's moving marketsPakistan shares see biggest one-day gain in 15 years post IMF dealGermany plans $18.1 billion in new borrowing for 2024 - sources]"

But it's been a pretty ho-hum year for the rest of the index, which has been dominated by some big-name laggards.""Part of it, in our view, is the average stocks better reflect some of the broader macroeconomic uncertainty and significant increase in the Fed funds rates over the past year,"" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner tells Yahoo Finance.Powered mostly by hype around new generative AI technology, seven stocks have fueled most of the S&amp;P 500's 15% year-to-date advance, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.Another view from Goldman Sachs (chart below): 15 of the biggest companies have driven 86% of the S&amp;P 500's return year-to-date.Nvidia (AI hype) and Meta (cost-cutting and AI hype) have led the charge for the S&amp;P 500 with respective gains of 180% and 133%. Tesla shares are up 109% (AI hype and strong EV demand).Apple is up 46% on optimism around some pricey new VR goggles. Amazon is oddly up 52% despite not announcing anything on the AI front and continuing to have poor quarters. And Microsoft and Alphabet have traded blows on AI developments, in the process driving respective stock price gains of 39% and 34%.""These stocks have benefited from coming into the year in an oversold position, the excitement around AI, and earnings revision trends that have turned higher,"" Lerner says. ""Also, even if the economy slows as we expect, it’s likely that companies will continue to spend on tech, or fear of being left behind. That should be good for tech earnings on a relative basis.""But non-tech companies haven't fared quite as well. CVS Health is down 26%, Moderna is off 34% and VF Corp is down 31%.Will the rest of the S&amp;P 500 finally draw more interest from investors in the second half of the year? Pros like Lerner and BMO's Brian Belski expect a modest broadening out of the market's rally as investors seek out bargains and bet on no rate hikes in 2024.Story continues""The bogeyman of narrow market breadth has started to broaden out and is a trend we expect will continue,"" says Belski.Here are three relative laggards from the S&amp;P 500 this year that could gain favor on the Street.BUY #1: AT&amp;TYear to Date Performance: -13%AT&amp;T (T) has had a challenging first half of the year as declining subscriber growth, softer-than-expected sales and disappointing free cash flow levels kept investors away from the telecom giant.But despite those headwinds, David Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar, told Yahoo Finance that AT&amp;T is a top pick.""AT&amp;T is at the intersection of being a deep value play,"" Sekera said. ""Fundamentally, it’s in a relatively strong position. We rate the company with a narrow economic moat, which means it has long-term structural cost advantages.""Added positive: AT&amp;T's CFO Pascal Desroches told Yahoo Finance Live that key parts of the business have begun to turn the corner.BUY #2: OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUMYear to Date Performance: -8%Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the Houston-based oil company backed by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, has surprisingly been left in the dust.Shares are off more than 8% year to date amid lingering worries of softening oil demand against a backdrop of sluggish global economic growth. And the oil producer is not alone. The S&amp;P 500's Energy Select Sector (XLE) is down 10% year to date following the sector's massive 57.6% gain last year.Occidental’s largest shareholder, Buffett has protected the stock from the worst of this year's energy sector sell-off. He boosted his stake in the company to above 25% after buying 2.1 million more shares worth about $123 million.So, as Warren Buffett doubles down on Occidental, Portfolio Wealth Advisors CEO Lee Munson sees an opportunity to bet on the ‘beaten up’ stock too.""Back in 2019 they bought Anadarko – which means they own half the Permian Basin,"" Munson told Yahoo Finance Live. ""The Permian is the crown jewel. It’s cheap to extract, and once you pump it all out you can frack it to draw blood from a stone – printing money… I love that they have cheap production.""BUY #3: CISCOYear to Date Performance: +7%A challenging macroeconomic environment has left Cisco (CSCO) shares far behind its tech peers and the broader S&amp;P 500.The stock's 7% gain so far this year pales in comparison to the Nasdaq 100 Index’s (^NDX) 36% surge. Investors have overlooked the maker of computer networking equipment amid concern clients are cutting back on IT spending. Orders declined 23% in its most recent quarter.New Constructs CEO David Trainer told Yahoo Finance he sees the recent underperformance of Cisco as a buying opportunity, given ""terrific fundamentals with a return on invested capital (ROIC) at 15%.""Trainer added: ""The stock also boasts an attractive valuation that implies just 4% profit growth over the next decade. We think the company will do closer to 9% or 10% growth in profits.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the topic, head directly to 5 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees. Using cannabis can affect attention, memory, and learning, same as alcohol. It is understandable that employers prefer workers to be lucid during work, be it drugs or alcohol. However, workplace drug testing can only detect recent cannabis or drug use, and it does not necessarily determine potential safety problems in the future. Other substances like opioids, antidepressants, and medically prescribed marijuana can also cause impairment. If an employee offers a valid prescription, the employer has to legally accept their use of these medications. Similarly, with recreational drugs, unless employees come to work visibly stoned or with their mental faculties impaired, should it really matter to employers what they do on their own time? CBD products that don’t cause a high in users may also contain elements that trigger a positive response on a drug screening test. While many states approve of pre-employment drug testing, some instruct employers to inform applicants beforehand. An SHRM report highlighted that courts have decreed that pre-employment drug testing is not the same as medical examinations as per the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission demands that these drug tests be carried out after employees receive a conditional job acceptance. This is because the employer may need to make further medical inquiries to applicants based on the test results. Employers should also take into consideration local regulations. For example, conducting random drug tests is prohibited unless mandated by federal law in San Francisco. In California, the state constitution allows individuals the right to privacy, which means drug screenings without proper basis, such as random tests, are permitted in very exceptional circumstances. Similarly, employers must submit a written request to the labor commissioner in Connecticut, stating the reasons for performing random drug screenings, and get approval for the process.Story continuesDon't Miss: 15 States With the Biggest Drug Problems in 2023Moreover, the legalization of adult-use cannabis across a majority of states is also disrupting the “Just Say No” era when it comes to employment. One significant factor behind the decision to relax drug testing policies is the lack of young blood in the aging workforce. This extends to the federal government and military as well. Per a New York Times report, the US military has allowed 3,400 candidates who failed to meet the drug screening criteria to try for recruitment again over the last five years. Similarly, the FBI and CIA are also relaxing their drug policies and allowing the use of marijuana among job applicants. Moreover, the Biden Administration is aiming to be more lenient when it comes to security clearances, given that over half of the American population has indulged in recreational or medicinal cannabis, and most believe that it should be completely legal. According to Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin: “We don’t want to be disqualifying half of the population, tens of millions of people, for having done something that most of our recent presidents have done. You’re taking huge numbers of people off the field.”Similarly, multiple changes have been made to drug testing policies by government agencies. The CIA, beginning from April 2022, reduced the marijuana abstinence period for new candidates to just 90 days, down from one year. The FBI also lowered its marijuana abstention requirement for potential candidates from three years to one year in 2021. In December 2021, Avril D. Haines, the Director of National Intelligence, announced that past recreational marijuana use should be considered ""relevant"" but not the sole factor in determining an individual's suitability for sensitive national security positions.In this article, we discuss 25 big companies that don’t drug test employees. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Our Methodology For this article, we selected the most prominent firms whose websites don’t explicitly state the need for pre-employment drug screening or random drug testing for employees. For companies whose websites were unclear, we researched on LinkedIn, Indeed, Reddit, and Zippia, and relied on majority consensus to shortlist firms that don’t drug test employees. It is important to note that most companies reserve the right to perform drug tests on employees who are involved in workplace accidents which could normally be prevented, or individuals who show up to work with their mental faculties very clearly impaired.  25 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test EmployeesCopyright: antonioguillem / 123RF Stock PhotoBig Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees25.

The company reported system-wide same-store sales increased 8.2%, raised estimates for growth in net income, and authorized another large share repurchase. Membership grew to an all-time record, now fully recovered from the pandemic lows. New gym openings are somewhat constrained by availability of HVAC units, but we envision the pace of growth will accelerate and that the base of gyms can still double over time from 2,000 to 4,000. We believe that EBITDA can grow at a mid-teens rate long term on a declining share count and that the trading multiple can modestly expand, which will drive continued good stock performance.”15.

(NASDAQ:DLTR) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Our largest individual detractors were Brookfield Corporation, Alphabet, Amazon, Black Knight, and Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR). Alphabet’s price-to-earnings multiple continues to contract due to concerns about the potential for revenue to be more economically sensitive than it has been historically, given the vast size of the business today. At Amazon, cost pressures and slowing AWS growth weighed on its share price. The regulatory status of Intercontinental Exchange’s pending acquisition offer for Black Knight remains a concern, while in the interim, business conditions have deteriorated given the slowdown in the mortgage market.

(NYSE:DKS) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. was the first stock Michael recommended to us shortly after he joined Baron Capital in 2003. Dick’s share price has since increased about nine-fold. Unfortunately, we sold our investment in Dick’s about six years ago and, although it was a successful investment, we did not realize the full benefit of Michael’s recommendation. We sold too soon because I was concerned that competition from internet retailers would have a permanent negative impact on Dick’s stores’ profitability. I was wrong. Dick’s stock price so far has about doubled after we sold…and its prospects have brightened!We sold even though we considered Ed Stack, Dick’s Chairm”n and CEO, a terrific retailer, a great entrepreneur and a special person. Ed had built Dick’s from three bait and tackle stores his dad started into a uniquely positioned, nationwide chain of 730 sporting goods stores. In fact, Dick’s is now the largest nationwide sporting goods chain. Ed had purchased the three bait and tackle stores, the foundation of Dick’s business, from his dad. Ed’s mother loaned him the money to buy his dad’s stores! I’m not exactly sure what that signifies. But it may have something to do with Carl Icahn’s proclamation that “everything I have is for sale except my children…and maybe my wife.”Ed and his newly appointed CEO Lauren Hobart visited us last month. Ed asked for the meeting to introduce us to Lauren, as well as to discuss the prospects for Dick’s new, large format stores with attached outdoor, student athletic fields. Lauren then described how well its new format stores were doing in two smaller communities. We also spoke about the successes of Dick’s omni-channel retailing efforts and how desirable Dick’s stores have become to shopping centers trying to lure shoppers to return to their malls.”13.

(NYSE:KR), compared to 42 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 50 million shares worth $2.46 billion. Oakmark Fund made the following comment about The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”12.

Same store sales were positive with better-than-expected margins resulting in earnings for the quarter ahead of expectations. At the same time, Target provided guidance for 2023 that was below expectations, which sets them up to meet or exceed expectations after a difficult 2022. Target expects same store sales for 2023 to range from a low single digit decline to a low single digit increase, with operating margins in the 4.5% to 5% range. We continue to view Target as well positioned for long-term growth with its strong owned brand strategy and omnichannel offerings.”11. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

Despite needing to raise prices by double digit rates to offset inflation in food prices and higher labor costs, the company has seen resilient customer demand. While digital orders have fallen from peak COVID levels, digital sales stabilized in the fourth quarter at approximately 40% of all orders or twice the volume seen pre-COVID. The company has remained busy opening new locations with a focus on those that can support a Chipotlane, the company’s drive through concept that leverages customers’ ability to order ahead on their phones to make pick up times very short.

Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”9.

While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees.  Suggested articles:Top 20 Countries With Highest Drug Consumption20 Most Commonly Used Recreational Drugs in America15 Most Profitable Drugs In The World Disclosure: None. 25 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

With the index up 14.3% year-to-date, the odds aren’t good for it to reach a new high before the end of the year. Why’s that, you ask? InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWell, if it hit 4,818.63 on Dec. 31 and stayed there to the close, it would finish the year up 25.5%. The index has beaten that return on four occasions since 2000, a success rate of 17%. Two of those occurred in the past five years. If you believe in regression to the mean, it seems unlikely. However, not wanting to be a party pooper, I will assume that the good times will continue through the remainder of 2023. With that in mind, I’m looking to invest in high-performing stocks to keep the ball rolling higher over the next six months and into 2024.Here are my three possibilities. Linde (LIN)Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical companySource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.comLinde (NYSE:LIN) plays an important part in global business, manufacturing and distributing industrial gases such as oxygen, nitrogen, nitrogen helium, hydrogen, and many others. It’s hard to think of an industry that isn’t aided in some fashion by its work. Its stock has been on a run the past five years, up 136%, more than double the S&amp;P’s Top 50. Year-to-date, it’s once again outpacing the index. When you’re a $182 billion market-capitalization stock, you can afford to meet your customers where they work. As a result, Linde will build a gas plant on your property if the need for its industrial gases is significant, say for 10 or 20 years. The best part: the contracts come with price escalators to ensure inflation doesn’t take a bite out of profits.  The Americas account for 46% of its revenue, with the rest of the world accounting for 54%. Its top three markets by sales are manufacturing (22%), chemicals and energy (22%), and metals and mining (14%).  Story continuesGreen hydrogen has become a big deal with the world transitioning from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. Linde expects this market for the company will grow to $50 billion worldwide over the next decade, with a whopping 60% generated in the U.S.Based on a trailing, 12-month free cash flow of $5.42 billion and a market cap of $182.4 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 3.0%. While it’s not cheap (I consider anything below 4% to be relatively expensive), there’s no question it has delivered for shareholders over the long haul because the need for its products will continue to persist.  Darden Restaurants (DRI)Source: ShutterstockDarden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI) is up 41% over the past year. It’s trading within 4.1% of its 52-week and all-time high of $168.98. The stock fell on June 22 after the restaurant operator reported a few weak spots in its lineup, especially in fine dining. However, as iCapital Chief Strategist Anastasia Amoroso told Yahoo Finance, the consumer is in fine shape. “But when I look, Julie [Yahoo Finance host Julie Hyman], to a point to the big macro picture, what I see is the consumer that has a job and is getting paid more for that job. 3.5% unemployment rate, 4.4% year-over-year wage growth. And, by the way, when you take inflation into account, that means that actually in real terms wages ever so slightly are going up,” Amoroso said on June 22. Despite the same-store sales miss for Olive Garden — they were 4.4% compared to a 5% estimate — they were still very positive. Add in the same-store sales growth of 7.1% for LongHorn Steakhouse, and the recent purchase of Ruth’s Chris Steak House, and you’ve got the ingredients for a long run-up of its share price.  Of the 29 analysts covering its stock, 19 rate it overweight or an outright buy, with a target price of $173.Monster Beverage (MNST)Grocery store shelf with 16 ounce cans of Monster brand energy drinks.Source: Sheila Fitzgerald / Shutterstock.comYou often hear stories of people who’ve become wealthy investing with Warren Buffett. The same isn’t true for Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), but it should be. The energy drink company consistently shows up on lists of the top-performing stocks of the past “x” number of years. U.S. News &amp; World Report listed the 10 best-performing stocks of the past 30 years in May. Monster Beverage was number one, with a cumulative return of 213,088%. A $10,000 bet in 1992 was worth $21.3 million as of August 2022. It’s up another 31% in the past year, adding to its lead. On May 5, Monster hit a 52-week high of $60.47. That also happens to be its all-time high. It’s currently trading at $59.69, 1.3% below its all-time high. Monster Beverage generates a lot of free cash. In January 2022, it acquired CANarchy Craft Brewery Collective LLC. Its beer brands include Cigar City, Oskar Blues, Deep Ellum, and others. It paid $330 million, about one-third of its annual free cash flow.   “This transaction provides us with a springboard from which to enter the alcoholic beverage sector,” said Monster’s Vice Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer Hilton Schlosberg at the time. In Q1 2023, its Alcohol Brands segment, which holds the CANarchy assets, had revenue of $46.3 million, up from $15.2 million a year earlier. It’s currently not generating positive operating income. Give it time. Monster is a profit machine. On the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(NYSE:PM) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you want to learn more about discounted cash flow, the rationale behind this calculation can be read in detail in the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International Crunching The NumbersWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:Story continues10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.7bUS$11.5bUS$12.2bUS$12.7bUS$13.2bUS$13.6bUS$14.0bUS$14.4bUS$14.8bUS$15.1bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x6Analyst x5Est @ 5.53%Est @ 4.50%Est @ 3.79%Est @ 3.28%Est @ 2.93%Est @ 2.68%Est @ 2.51%Est @ 2.39% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.3% US$10.0kUS$10.0kUS$9.9kUS$9.6kUS$9.3kUS$8.9kUS$8.6kUS$8.2kUS$7.8kUS$7.5k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$90bThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.3%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$15b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (7.3%– 2.1%) = US$296bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$296b÷ ( 1 + 7.3%)10= US$146bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$236b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$97.6, the company appears quite undervalued at a 36% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Philip Morris International as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.3%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.879. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Philip Morris InternationalStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.Dividend is in the top 25% of dividend payers in the market.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Total liabilities exceed total assets, which raises the risk of financial distress.Dividends are not covered by earnings and cashflows.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

But as Peter Lynch said in One Up On Wall Street, 'Long shots almost never pay off.' While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.In contrast to all that, many investors prefer to focus on companies like TransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG), which has not only revenues, but also profits. Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide TransDigm Group with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. See our latest analysis for TransDigm Group How Quickly Is TransDigm Group Increasing Earnings Per Share?If a company can keep growing earnings per share (EPS) long enough, its share price should eventually follow. That means EPS growth is considered a real positive by most successful long-term investors. Over the last three years, TransDigm Group has grown EPS by 11% per year. That's a pretty good rate, if the company can sustain it.Top-line growth is a great indicator that growth is sustainable, and combined with a high earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margin, it's a great way for a company to maintain a competitive advantage in the market. TransDigm Group shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 40% to 43%, and revenue is growing. Both of which are great metrics to check off for potential growth.The chart below shows how the company's bottom and top lines have progressed over time. To see the actual numbers, click on the chart.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for TransDigm Group's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre TransDigm Group Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?We would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$49b company like TransDigm Group. But we do take comfort from the fact that they are investors in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$221m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.4% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. This still shows shareholders there is a degree of alignment between management and themselves.Does TransDigm Group Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?As previously touched on, TransDigm Group is a growing business, which is encouraging. For those who are looking for a little more than this, the high level of insider ownership enhances our enthusiasm for this growth. The combination definitely favoured by investors so consider keeping the company on a watchlist. You should always think about risks though. Case in point, we've spotted   2 warning signs for TransDigm Group  you should be aware of.The beauty of investing is that you can invest in almost any company you want.

(NASDAQ:AMGN) insiders ditched their stock over the past year, which may be of interest to the company's shareholders. When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. See our latest analysis for Amgen The Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At AmgenOver the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Lead Independent Director, Robert Eckert, for US$1.6m worth of shares, at about US$249 per share. While we don't usually like to see insider selling, it's more concerning if the sales take place at a lower price. It's of some comfort that this sale was conducted at a price well above the current share price, which is US$222. So it may not tell us anything about how insiders feel about the current share price.Insiders in Amgen didn't buy any shares in the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeI will like Amgen better if I see some big insider buys. While we wait, check out this free list of growing companies with considerable, recent, insider buying.Insider Ownership Of AmgenAnother way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Amgen insiders own 0.2% of the company, currently worth about US$192m based on the recent share price. This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Amgen Insiders?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's heartening that insiders own plenty of stock, but we'd like to see more insider buying, since the last year of Amgen insider transactions don't fill us with confidence. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Amgen. To assist with this, we've discovered 1 warning sign that you should run your eye over to get a better picture of Amgen.Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

(NYSE:NRG)",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/calculating-fair-value-nrg-energy-142830964.html,1688308110,STORY,['NRG'],"[Key InsightsNRG Energy's estimated fair value is US$35.19 based on Dividend Discount ModelCurrent share price of US$37.39 suggests NRG Energy is potentially trading close to its fair valueOur fair value estimate is 13% lower than NRG Energy's analyst price target of US$40.67Today we will run through one way of estimating the intrinsic value of NRG Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NRG) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. It may sound complicated, but actually it is quite simple!Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for NRG Energy Is NRG Energy Fairly Valued?As NRG Energy operates in the electric utilities sector, we need to calculate the intrinsic value slightly differently. In this approach dividends per share (DPS) are used, as free cash flow is difficult to estimate and often not reported by analysts. Unless a company pays out the majority of its FCF as a dividend, this method will typically underestimate the value of the stock. The 'Gordon Growth Model' is used, which simply assumes that dividend payments will continue to increase at a sustainable growth rate forever. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a company's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). In this case we used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%). The expected dividend per share is then discounted to today's value at a cost of equity of 6.9%. Relative to the current share price of US$37.4, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.Story continuesValue Per Share = Expected Dividend Per Share / (Discount Rate - Perpetual Growth Rate)= US$1.7 / (6.9% – 2.1%)= US$35.2dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at NRG Energy as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 6.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 0.800. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for NRG EnergyStrengthDebt is well covered by earnings.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Electric Utilities market.OpportunityExpected to breakeven next year.Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows.Good value based on P/S ratio compared to estimated Fair P/S ratio.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Paying a dividend but company is unprofitable.Revenue is forecast to decrease over the next 2 years.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

(NASDAQ:PDCO)?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/time-consider-buying-patterson-companies-120643946.html,1688386003,STORY,['PDCO'],"[Patterson Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:PDCO), might not be a large cap stock, but it received a lot of attention from a substantial price increase on the NASDAQGS over the last few months. With many analysts covering the mid-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s examine Patterson Companies’s valuation and outlook in more detail to determine if there’s still a bargain opportunity. See our latest analysis for Patterson Companies What's The Opportunity In Patterson Companies?The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 19.49% above my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Patterson Companies today, you’d be paying a relatively reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $27.84, then there isn’t really any room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Patterson Companies’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.What does the future of Patterson Companies look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 27% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Patterson Companies. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in PDCO’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on PDCO, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.So if you'd like to dive deeper into this stock, it's crucial to consider any risks it's facing.

(NASDAQ:EXPE) saw a significant share price rise of over 20% in the past couple of months on the NASDAQGS. With many analysts covering the large-cap stock, we may expect any price-sensitive announcements have already been factored into the stock’s share price. But what if there is still an opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Expedia Group’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists. See our latest analysis for Expedia Group What Is Expedia Group Worth?Expedia Group is currently expensive based on my price multiple model, where I look at the company's price-to-earnings ratio in comparison to the industry average. I’ve used the price-to-earnings ratio in this instance because there’s not enough visibility to forecast its cash flows. The stock’s ratio of 49.25x is currently well-above the industry average of 20.19x, meaning that it is trading at a more expensive price relative to its peers. If you like the stock, you may want to keep an eye out for a potential price decline in the future. Since Expedia Group’s share price is quite volatile, this could mean it can sink lower (or rise even further) in the future, giving us another chance to invest. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market.What does the future of Expedia Group look like?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Expedia Group's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.What This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? It seems like the market has well and truly priced in EXPE’s positive outlook, with shares trading above industry price multiples. However, this brings up another question – is now the right time to sell? If you believe EXPE should trade below its current price, selling high and buying it back up again when its price falls towards the industry PE ratio can be profitable. But before you make this decision, take a look at whether its fundamentals have changed.Story continuesAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on EXPE for some time, now may not be the best time to enter into the stock. The price has surpassed its industry peers, which means it is likely that there is no more upside from mispricing. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for EXPE, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors in order to take advantage of the next price drop.If you'd like to know more about Expedia Group as a business, it's important to be aware of any risks it's facing.

After recording one of its worst periods last year, there is a sense of positive momentum in the market. Investors and market participants are witnessing a gradual rebound, with the overall sentiment becoming more optimistic. According to a Natixis Global Survey of individual investors, 68% of the surveyed individuals hold a positive view regarding their current financial situation. The study was conducted across 23 countries with 8,550 participants. That said, the S&amp;P 500 index is up 16.3% year-to-date and NASDAQ gained 32.7% so far, recovering from their all-time lows last year.Over the years, investors have actively sought out various investment strategies as a means to navigate potential market downturns and protect their portfolios. Generally, investors start with low-priced and penny stocks as an opportunity to enter the stock market with a smaller initial investment. The term ""penny stocks"" usually doesn't apply to well-established companies. Although there may be a few legitimate, multibillion-dollar companies with a stock price below $5 at times. For example, Lloyds Banking Group plc (NYSE:LYG) has a market cap of $36 billion and currently trades at a share price of $2.2 as of July 2. Similarly, many companies initially started as penny stocks and have experienced significant growth, emerging as major players in the stock market. For instance, investors who bought Ford Motor Co (NYSE:F) in 1983 at $2.11 per share would have experienced substantial growth in their investment, as the stock price has multiplied several times since then. However, investing in penny stocks carries higher risks compared to investing in more established and larger companies.Story continuesAlso read: 10 Hot Penny Stocks To BuyPenny stocks that pay dividends can be attractive to some investors due to the potential for regular income. However, the ability of penny stocks to sustain dividend payments is crucial as smaller companies may have limited cash flow or face challenges.

We would like to allow as many of you to ask questions as possible in our allotted time, so we would appreciate you limiting your initial question to one. Thanks for your cooperation on this. I will now turn the call over to NIKE, Inc., President and CEO, John Donahoe.John Donahoe: Thank you, Paul, and hello to everyone on today's call. Fiscal 2023 was a milestone year for NIKE as we set new records while delivering on our operational and financial goals. It's clear that our strategy is working, and that NIKE's unique advantages continue to drive competitive separation. Looking at our results, we exceeded $50 billion in revenue, with growth of 16% on the year. This growth is broad based across our consumer construct of men's, women's, and kids, across performance and lifestyle and across all geographies. North America, EMEA, and APLA all saw full-year double-digit growth and Greater China returned to double-digit growth in Q4. We're also driving strength through our interesting-leading brand portfolio with NIKE, Jordan, and Converse, all of which achieved strong growth in fiscal 2023.Story continuesIn particular, I want to highlight Jordan's brand's record year. Jordan grew mid-30s with impressive growth across men's, women's, and kids, footwear and apparel and in both North America and International. In fact, Jordan is well on its way to becoming the second largest footwear brand in North America. And last but not least, we return to healthy inventory ahead of our competition. Our inventory is flat year-over-year in value and down in units versus 12 months ago. The actions we've taken position us for more profitable growth moving forward. Across our business, we continue to build a marketplace that addresses how consumers want to be served giving them what they want, when they want it, and how they want it. NIKE creates distinction across the marketplace by segmenting consumer experiences to drive deep direct connections with consumers and grow the marketplace.Today in the industry with digital and physical growth converging, we've accelerated investment to create a truly distinctive digital experience through our own platforms. Every year, we serve traffic in the billions, which delivers strong digital growth as both conversion rate and average order value continue to improve. This success helped increase the digital share of our business to 26% in fiscal 2023 as compared to 10% in fiscal 2019. For the year, we had strong digital growth of 24% and we expect digital to continue to lead our growth. Now, this is all powered by our membership offense. We know our consumers better and are better able to serve them with data driven insights fueling our end-to-end value chain, including product creation, marketing, and merchandising.This is translating into sustainable and profitable growth for NIKE, and we believe this growth will only accelerate as we add new capabilities built to serve consumers at scale. In fiscal 2023, we expanded our membership base, but more importantly, we elevated and deepened these consumer relationships. Our members now engage with us more frequently, buy more, and are more loyal to our brands. Once members join our ecosystem, they are increasing their lifelong sport journeys with us. Now of course, NIKE members also shop across marketplace channels. And so, as we grow, we're always actively managing our marketplace to serve consumers with expanded choice, access, and convenience. We think about our multi-brand partners in three complementary groups that each serve distinct needs.First, as you know, over the past five years, we've created greater focus and differentiation working with fewer large multi-brand partners. These partners have the scale to invest in retail experiences and connected digital membership to drive long-term growth. Second, we've also sharpened our commitment to neighborhood, authenticators in both sport and lifestyle to drive energy and validate our brand. This investment in community ensures brand access, as well as deep local consumer connection. And third, we partner with accounts that help us provide access to consumers across different segments and price points. And at the same time, we continue to invest in NIKE store concepts that create new distribution and serve growth opportunities not currently being addressed by our wholesale partners.The recent unveiling of our NIKE Well Collective, which responds to deep insight from our female consumers, [rebrand] [ph] NIKE Live, and creates an elevated approach to retail. NIKE Well Collective brings new energy and sharpens our focus on serving the opportunity we see with women. So, this is how our consumer direct acceleration strategy drives the future of the marketplace, a seamless member led experience that addresses the opportunities as we see them across the consumer landscape. Last month, I was in Shanghai and Beijing, and I was blown away by how the entire marketplace experience comes to live there. Our Greater China team is building a connected and seamless journey across digital and physical, commerce and social, owned and partner doors.And I will tell you the merchandising is best-in-class. You can just feel the energy of our brand and our product. And with our record-breaking performance during this year's 6/18 shopping holiday, in which we were the number one sports brand on Tmall, I'm even more confident in our playbook and strategy in China. Today, we're excited and confident with the opportunity we see in front of us. And looking to fiscal 2024 and beyond, we will continue to expand our competitive separation. To that end, this quarter, we made some shifts within our senior leadership team that will further deepen our growth and accelerate our marketplace advantage, elevating Heidi Oneill and Craig Williams to become NIKE Brands' two Presidents. Heidi and Craig are both incredible leaders with long track records of driving growth and results.And their new roles are designed to drive an even greater focus on innovation and integration for our business. These changes will streamline our efforts across product, brand storytelling, and marketplace. I will tell you, I'm thrilled and I can also tell you that their teams are thrilled as well for the kind of growth we'll be able to achieve under this new simplified structure. For the remainder of my remarks today, I want to walk you through something that defines everything we do and that's sport. Sport is who we are. It will always be our differentiator. No brand can grow the world of sport, like NIKE. No brand connects people to sport by putting all of the pieces together like we can. We stay in the lead because we combine innovation, brand, and the culture of sport and do it all at global scale.This is the power of our strategy. We're able to both unleash athlete potential and create the lifestyle of sport around the globe. Where other brands strive to grow their slice of the pie, we're able to grow the pie itself. Let me walk through three areas where we have expanded the world of sport and where we see even greater opportunity ahead. First, let's discuss Global Football. In fiscal 2023, Global Football grew 25%, nearly doubling overall NIKE growth. With women's and kids' businesses growing even faster, key boot franchises like Mercurial and Phantom, saw high full price realization as we continue to win share on pitch. We invest in the grassroots of the game, while also partnering with the sports’ greatest. Erling Haaland joined our roster this quarter as his record pace of goal scoring cements his step on the future of the game, and we can't wait for this summer's World Cup.NIKE is proud to partner with more federations in the tournament than any other brand, and we've matched that energy with our most comprehensive women's football collection ever. For example, we'll watch the most innovative woman's led football boot in our history. After more than two years of testing and designing, the new Phantom Luna boot features a proprietary cleat pattern that provides [peak traction] [ph] and stability for female players. In addition, our World Cup kits will debut significant fit and material innovations mapped to a woman's specific movements. And last but not least, we've created our largest ever football inspired sportswear collection. For both fans and athletes, when they're off pitch. We're just weeks out from the tournament and we're focused and aligned to drive energy like no one else as we connect the next generation of fans to the world’s most popular sport.Next, let's discuss basketball, where we continue to see significant market leadership. Today, NIKE defines basketball. And as we look at landscape, we see only expanding competitive separation ahead. Our influence in basketball is elevated by the strength of our portfolio of brands, NIKE, Jordan, and Converse. In fact, our roster, which is already the game's greatest, set a new standard this season. For the first time ever, all three of our brands were represented in the All-NBA first team. With Luca and Jason from Jordan, Giannis from Nike, and Rising Star Shai Gilgeous-Alexander from Converse. This is an unprecedented accomplishment. And speaking of the game's greatest, fiscal 2023 marked 20 years of LeBron’s signature shoe. We're excited by the continued potential of the LeBron business as his brand reaches a new dimension by bringing back earlier styles onto the court, igniting new energy for these retro models with consumers.And in addition, the Sabrina 1 is resonating strongly since launch, helping double our WNBA business versus what it was two short years ago. It's going to be an exciting summer, as we set the stage to relaunch the Kobe brand in advance of Kobe Day on 8/24. And as you know, it's already been a great few months for basketball. We had a thrilling NBA season, which concluded with Nikola Jokić taking the Denver Nuggets to their first ever title. The WNBA season kicked off with Brittney Griner making her return to the court. And earlier this week, A'ja Wilson was named an All-Star team captain. And in China, 10x Chinese Basketball Association All-Star point guard, Guo Ailun won his third CBA Championship. And earlier this week, in fact, last week in the NBA draft, Victor Wembanyama was selected number 1 overall by the San Antonio Spurs.nike, france, suzanne, slam, philippe, roger, ball, tennis, paris, shot, roland, centre, garros, win, switzerland, match, grand, champion, racquet, open, stade, tour, lenglen,Leonard Zhukovsky / Shutterstock.comWe're thrilled to have Victor in the NIKE family, and we're excited for what the future holds in basketball. Now, I want to take a minute to go a little bit deeper into the Jordan brand. Jordan's greatest advantage is its authenticity and connection to sport, which drives a special bond with generation upon generation. This brand has built a cultural identity that transcends the game, connecting people with deep emotion, and a sense of self belief. If this authenticity that fuels Jordan's leadership and streetwear, Jordan continues to dictate the conversation by being a premium brand [that drives] [ph] sportswear culture. You've seen this come to life through Jordan's partners across top culture, from product launches like the Women's Teyana Taylor AJ 1 High, to the brand's meaningful collaboration with the movie, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse.Today, Jordan is extending its core strength in men's. In Q4, Jordan launched the Tatum 1, which completes Jordan's Signature offense along with Luca, Zion, and the Game Shoe. With this foundation in place, Jordan has plans to now scale these four franchises even further. And at the same time, Jordan is building real energy around our biggest growth opportunities. In fiscal 2023, Jordan had over indexing growth in both women's and kid’s alongside increasing strength in apparel. And today, Jordan's growth in performance footwear is now outpacing retro footwear, but no discussion of Jordan’s opportunity would be complete with, also looking at its international business. In most of our geos, Jordan's penetration is about 10 points lower than it is in North America, and this is the growth opportunity we plan to capture moving ahead.Simply put, we continue to see a tremendous amount of potential for the Jordan brand and its differentiated ability to drive culture, connection, and growth like nothing else. Finally, let me comment on our running business. Running's been a competitive battlefield lately with more and more brands joining the market. And today, we're more aligned in resource to compete and win. We saw roughly 10% growth for our running footwear business in fiscal 2023, and we're just getting started. Now, as you know, NIKE's advantage in innovation is shown as we continue to set the pace in racing and trail running categories led by the new Vaporfly 3 and Peg Trail 4, respectively. And following a recent reset, we're prioritizing the needs of everyday runners through newness and consistency in the key styles they love most.For example, last quarter, we launched the Invincible 3, which continues to perform well. Since its Q3 launch, Invincible has already doubled its retail sales versus last year. And next quarter, we're debuting the Infinity Run 4, another major update to a popular franchise. In fact, I'm wearing a pair right now, and I have to say, they feel great. The Infinity 4’s React X is our newest of them. A breakthrough innovation that's more sustainable and offers runners a smooth and responsive ride following years of women led testing. And this is just the start as we reinvigorate our running footwear line with more to be unveiled as we build momentum heading into the Olympics in Paris next summer. And in addition to innovating four runners, we're also driving the lifestyle of running as only NIKE can.The Vomero 5, which in fiscal 2023 kicked-off our strategic relaunch into the intersection of running and streetwear, has already become a staple of modern sneaker culture. The Vomero 5 is coming into the summer with a lot of momentum as we substantially increased its volume all-year. And just last month, we launched the Motiva. A walking shoe with a distinctive design at an attractive price point and one that's represented of the aggressive approach we're taking to opportunities we see in the market. In just two months post-launch, Motiva has had strong sell-through. particularly for women, already becoming a top 5 performance footwear style globally, a NIKE Digital. Ultimately, when we look at the full running business, while we know there's a lot of work ahead, we remain confident in our go forward strategy and firm in our belief that we're all set to compete with strengths.In the end, our CDA strategy is working. Our brands have strong energy. Our innovation pipeline is as relentless as ever, and we're executing against what matters most to consumers. And as we look at fiscal 2024, NIKE will occupy the same leadership position that we earned year after year as we usher our industry into the future. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Matt.Matt Friend: Thanks, John and hello to everyone on the call. NIKE is a growth company and fiscal 2023 demonstrated our ability to deliver strong growth in the midst of rapidly changing market conditions. Throughout the year, we drove competitive separation by doing what NIKE does best. Serve athletes with product innovation, and rich storytelling, amplify our brand voice through key sport and consumer moments, deepen consumer connections across our portfolio, and actively manage the marketplace to drive sustainable profitable growth. For the full-year, we delivered mid-teens revenue growth with accelerating momentum in our performance business and sustained strength and lifestyle. We added $7 billion of revenue in total on a currency neutral basis, which included adding $3 billion to North America, our largest most mature market.In addition, our top franchises drove strong full price sales with mid-single-digit price increases, and we grew units and ASP across both product engines. In Q4, we saw another quarter of strong consumer demand, with traffic growing online and in our stores and total retail sales across the marketplace up double-digits versus the prior year. Beyond driving strong top line growth, we finished the year with a significantly improved marketplace position, with total marketplace inventory units, including NIKE and our wholesale partners, down year-over-year. We feel very good about the results driven by our decisive actions over this past year, as well as the sales momentum that we continue to see from NIKE Direct and our top strategic partners, including DICK'S Sporting Goods, JD, Sports Direct, and our city specialty partners.To go a little deeper on inventory, NIKE Inc. inventory dollars are flat versus the prior year, with units down double-digits across both footwear and apparel. Apparel units are down more than 20% versus the prior year. Our mix of in-transit inventory has normalized, and days in inventory show improvement versus the prior quarter and the prior year. Closeout mix is in-line with pre-pandemic levels, with improvements in the average age of our closeout inventory versus the prior year. And from a geography perspective, both North America and Greater China have inventory dollars down high-single-digit versus the prior year, with units being down double-digits. All told, we are entering fiscal 2024 on our front foot, ready to navigate any uncertainty that may be ahead of us, and ready to compete from a position of strength.Now as we move forward, we are building on a strong foundation for future growth. Our confidence is grounded in the power of NIKE's portfolio. Deeply connected to the consumer, centered in sport and youth culture, fueling authenticity and distinction, unrivaled in breadth and depth. Our strength begins with our scale from our investment in innovation, to our sports marketing portfolio, our digital platforms and membership, and our global reach. We create value for consumers around the world, leveraging NIKE's scale and competitive advantages, to drive sustainable growth and strong returns to shareholders over the long-term. And today NIKE's opportunity to grow is as large as it's ever been. Consumer interest around the world in sport, health, and wellness has never been greater and what excites us most is the potential still ahead.Let me share just a few examples. First, one of NIKE's greatest competitive advantages is our relentless pace of innovation. We innovate to make athletes better, to serve more athletes, and to make the world better for athletes everywhere. And right now, in our LeBron James Innovation Center, we are creating new concepts, new platforms, and new capabilities to fuel NIKE's next 50 years of innovation and growth. We will continue to increase investment in innovation to create value for athletes, and this gives me confidence we can drive long-term growth for NIKE. We have some great opportunities over this next fiscal year to showcase our latest innovations on the global sports stage. Second, we're accelerating direct consumer relationships across our digital platforms.By better knowing and serving the consumers who love our brands, we are also unlocking strategic and financial benefits for NIKE. For example, we have partnered with Adobe to enable 1-to-1 member personalization, driving gains in member retention, click through rates, and conversion, resulting in higher demand per member and returns on digital ad spend. We're only beginning to operationalize these new capabilities and consumer experiences on our digital platforms and we see even greater opportunity to come. Third, we see meaningful growth potential in our international markets. This includes Korea, one of our most digitally connected markets, Central and South America, a region with a deep love of sport, Southeast Asia and India, with one of the world's largest youth populations.And, of course, China, where young consumers are seeking our top product innovation, and Gen Z is coming of age as the country's most active generation ever. Last, we can now see around the corner on the transitory cost headwinds that pressured profitability in fiscal 2022 and 2023. When combined with our structural opportunities to improve profitability as we grow, we are confident that we will deliver above average margin improvement in fiscal 2024 with many of the drivers continuing into fiscal 2025. Now, let me turn into our NIKE, Inc. fourth quarter results. In Q4 NIKE, Inc. revenue grew 5% on a reported basis and 8% on a currency neutral basis. NIKE Direct grew 18% with 14% growth in NIKE Digital, and 24% growth in NIKE Stores. Wholesale grew 2%, moderating as planned, as we tightened supply to normalize marketplace inventory levels.Gross margins declined a 140 basis points to 43.6% on a reported basis, primarily due to higher product input costs and elevated freight and logistics expenses. Higher markdowns, and 100 basis points of unfavorable changes in net foreign currency exchange rates, partially offset by strategic pricing actions and lapping higher inventory obsolescence reserves in Greater China in the prior period. SG&amp;A grew 8% on a reported basis, primarily due to wage related expenses, variable NIKE direct costs, and increased demand creation expenses. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.3%. Diluted earnings per share was $0.66. Now, let me turn to our operating segments. In North America, Q4 revenue grew 5%. NIKE Direct was up 15%, and NIKE Digital grew 17%.Wholesale declined 3%, following reduced spring and summer sell-in to proactively manage marketplace inventory. EBIT declined 6% on a reported basis. For another consecutive quarter, strong consumer demand drove total retail sales up double-digits across the marketplace, enabling us to drive a quicker return to healthy marketplace inventory levels. Member engagement grew on all-digital platforms and buying frequency was at an all-time high. NIKE's store traffic and revenue grew double-digits surpassing industry trends. We saw strong brand momentum across our portfolio. Performance dimensions delivered strong growth with LeBron and Giannis at double-digits. Free Metcon extended its lead as our top women's performance franchise. And the Jordan brand delivered another dominant quarter with women's leading growth.Luka and Tatum highlighting momentum and performance, and iconic franchises inspiring the next generation. In fact, this quarter's AJ 1's Spider-Verse launch drove our largest ever kids shock drop on the sneakers app. With a robust product pipeline, a healthy mix of inventory, and a normalizing supply chain, we are confident in NIKE's ability to set the pace in North America as we look ahead. In EMEA, Q4 revenue grew 7%. NIKE Direct was up 28%, and NIKE Digital grew 24%. EBIT declined 13% on a reported basis. EMEA's fourth quarter results demonstrated the strength of our complete offense as NIKE increased market share in performance and lifestyle. Digital continues to power growth with traffic up double-digits and conversion rates expanding.Brick-and-mortar traffic in key countries also remain strong. NIKE's authenticity in sport and culture continues to create separation. Vaporfly and Alphafly top shoe counts, at the Paris and London marathons, while Pegasus and Invincible drove strong sell-through. We channeled the energy of Air Max Day into positive momentum for Air Max Pulse and Air Max 1. And we closed out our biggest football year ever, up double digits with strong full price sales, led by Mercurial and Phantom, and balanced growth across men's, women's, and kids. In Greater China, Q4 revenue grew 25%. NIKE Direct grew 19% with NIKE Digital declining 12% as consumer buying continues to over index in brick-and-mortar versus the prior year. EBIT grew 70% on a reported basis.This quarter left no doubt. Sport is back. Consumer confidence is rebounding, and NIKE's brand momentum is growing. We celebrated the return of sport with full marketing activations around the Chinese high school basketball league, Air Max Day, and Super Brand Day. And we extended that energy into our strongest product sell-through in eight seasons with full price momentum accelerated by our healthy inventory position. Running grew double-digits, fueled by newness in hyperlocal storytelling, including strong express lane executions for Invisible 3 and community activations around Pegasus 40. Basketball grew double-digits, led by the GT Cut. And we saw exceptional sell-through for our GT jump players edition inspired by longtime NIKE athlete, NIKE athlete, Ijen Leon.Earlier this month, our 6/18 results surpassed last year's record breaking performance with sales up double-digits. And next week, we will build on that momentum as we kick-off NIKE's first athlete tour in China since the pandemic by welcoming Giannis to Beijing. As we look forward, we are confident in the strength of our consumer connections and confident in NIKE's ability to drive sustainable long-term growth in China. In APLA, Q4 revenue grew 6%, including approximately 6 percentage points of a headwind due to the impact of our shift to a distributor model in Central and South America. NIKE Direct was up 9% with NIKE Digital growing 9%. EBIT declined 16% on a reported basis. This quarter highlighted our balanced growth in the region. Jordan Brand continued its international expansion with strong double-digit growth as our new world of flight doors in Tokyo and Seoul create local brand energy.We also saw strong growth in women's lifestyle and men's performance with positive momentum from Cortez and Vamiro 5 and sustained strength from Pegasus and Invincible 3. In global football, we drove double-digit growth across men's, women's, and kids with excitement building ahead of this summer's women's world cup. We finished the year in APLA with new milestones and new opportunities in the region. In Southeast Asia and India, we grew our business by over 40% this year, reinforcing the potential that we see in the market. In Korea, our NIKE app launch drove 2.5 million downloads and $100 million in incremental demand within its first quarter, showing how elevated local digital experiences can accelerate consumer demand. And across the region, we continue investing to grow.From launching argentina.com and peru.com to introducing NIKE's first direct digital footprint in India. Now, let me turn to our fiscal 2024 financial outlook. We enter the new year with clear advantages, strong consumer momentum, a robust product innovation pipeline, healthy inventory, and a normalized flow of supply. That said, we are closely monitoring the macro environment, consumer behavior, and retail trends. Our priority for fiscal 2024 is to drive healthy full price growth, while unlocking speed, agility, and efficiency in our operating model. We are focused on what we can control as we position NIKE to compete at its best. We are taking a balanced approach to planning our business, building on our proactive decisions more than six months ago to [tighten buys] [ph].We expect this to translate into an improved marginal cost of growth, expanding profitability and higher returns on invested capital. We have also taken into account several non-count factors from the prior year that will impact overall rates of growth, as well as quarterly comparisons. For the full-year, we expect fiscal 2024 reported revenue to grow mid-single-digits, led by NIKE Direct. This includes approximately four points of headwinds from the prior year from wholesale shipment timing and accelerated liquidation activities. In addition, based on current spot rates, we do not expect any material translation impact on revenue in fiscal 2024. We expect gross margins to expand a 140 basis points to a 160 basis points on a reported basis, which translates to approximately 200 basis points of operational gross margin expansion, excluding 50 basis points of negative impact from foreign exchange headwinds.This reflects the beginning of recovery from transitory headwinds, including more favorable ocean freight rates starting halfway through the second quarter and a modest improvement in markdowns versus the prior year. We also expect continued structural gains from our focus on price value, including low-single-digit price increases in fiscal 2024, plus ongoing benefits from our shift to a more direct business. We expect this to be partially offset by higher product costs with inflation causing higher labor and fulfillment expenses in parts of our supply chain. We expect SG&amp;A to grow slightly above revenue as we increase investment in demand creation to support key global sports moments and product launches and invest in capabilities to transform NIKE's operating model for greater speed and effectiveness.We will continue to manage SG&amp;A to remain below pre-pandemic levels as a percentage of revenue. Our other income and expense, including net interest income, is expected to be 225 million to 275 million of income the year, and we expect our effective tax rate to be similar to fiscal 2023. Now, let me provide a few important insights into our first quarter. We expect first quarter revenue growth to be flat to up low-single-digits, reflecting our decision to tighten first half buys and restrain marketplace inventory. We expect another quarter of sequential improvement in gross margin, down 50 basis points to 75 basis points on a reported basis, which translates to 25 basis points to 50 basis points of operational gross margin expansion, excluding the negative impact of a 100 basis points of foreign exchange headwinds.We expect SG&amp;A to grow low double digits on a reported basis, driven by increased demand creation investments around the women's World Cup and transformational investments to drive efficiency including the activation of the next stages of our ERP implementation in North America. Looking ahead, we will remain agile and on the offense, leveraging our experience, and the capabilities that we have developed to lead through times of uncertainty, while investing to capture the growth opportunities in front of us. For NIKE, creating the future always starts with serving athletes and sport. As we look to fiscal 2024, we have an incredible year of sport ahead of us from this summer's World Cup to the road to the Paris Olympic Games, it will be a year to remember, and just like the athletes we serve, NIKE will be ready to bring our best.With that, let's open up the call for questions.See also 15 Hardest Sports in the World Ranked and 16 Best Places to Live in Upstate New York for Families.To continue reading the Q&amp;A session, please click here.]"

But it's been a pretty ho-hum year for the rest of the index, which has been dominated by some big-name laggards.""Part of it, in our view, is the average stocks better reflect some of the broader macroeconomic uncertainty and significant increase in the Fed funds rates over the past year,"" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner tells Yahoo Finance.Powered mostly by hype around new generative AI technology, seven stocks have fueled most of the S&amp;P 500's 15% year-to-date advance, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.Another view from Goldman Sachs (chart below): 15 of the biggest companies have driven 86% of the S&amp;P 500's return year-to-date.Nvidia (AI hype) and Meta (cost-cutting and AI hype) have led the charge for the S&amp;P 500 with respective gains of 180% and 133%. Tesla shares are up 109% (AI hype and strong EV demand).Apple is up 46% on optimism around some pricey new VR goggles. Amazon is oddly up 52% despite not announcing anything on the AI front and continuing to have poor quarters. And Microsoft and Alphabet have traded blows on AI developments, in the process driving respective stock price gains of 39% and 34%.""These stocks have benefited from coming into the year in an oversold position, the excitement around AI, and earnings revision trends that have turned higher,"" Lerner says. ""Also, even if the economy slows as we expect, it’s likely that companies will continue to spend on tech, or fear of being left behind. That should be good for tech earnings on a relative basis.""But non-tech companies haven't fared quite as well. CVS Health is down 26%, Moderna is off 34% and VF Corp is down 31%.Will the rest of the S&amp;P 500 finally draw more interest from investors in the second half of the year? Pros like Lerner and BMO's Brian Belski expect a modest broadening out of the market's rally as investors seek out bargains and bet on no rate hikes in 2024.Story continues""The bogeyman of narrow market breadth has started to broaden out and is a trend we expect will continue,"" says Belski.Here are three relative laggards from the S&amp;P 500 this year that could gain favor on the Street.BUY #1: AT&amp;TYear to Date Performance: -13%AT&amp;T (T) has had a challenging first half of the year as declining subscriber growth, softer-than-expected sales and disappointing free cash flow levels kept investors away from the telecom giant.But despite those headwinds, David Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar, told Yahoo Finance that AT&amp;T is a top pick.""AT&amp;T is at the intersection of being a deep value play,"" Sekera said. ""Fundamentally, it’s in a relatively strong position. We rate the company with a narrow economic moat, which means it has long-term structural cost advantages.""Added positive: AT&amp;T's CFO Pascal Desroches told Yahoo Finance Live that key parts of the business have begun to turn the corner.BUY #2: OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUMYear to Date Performance: -8%Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the Houston-based oil company backed by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, has surprisingly been left in the dust.Shares are off more than 8% year to date amid lingering worries of softening oil demand against a backdrop of sluggish global economic growth. And the oil producer is not alone. The S&amp;P 500's Energy Select Sector (XLE) is down 10% year to date following the sector's massive 57.6% gain last year.Occidental’s largest shareholder, Buffett has protected the stock from the worst of this year's energy sector sell-off. He boosted his stake in the company to above 25% after buying 2.1 million more shares worth about $123 million.So, as Warren Buffett doubles down on Occidental, Portfolio Wealth Advisors CEO Lee Munson sees an opportunity to bet on the ‘beaten up’ stock too.""Back in 2019 they bought Anadarko – which means they own half the Permian Basin,"" Munson told Yahoo Finance Live. ""The Permian is the crown jewel. It’s cheap to extract, and once you pump it all out you can frack it to draw blood from a stone – printing money… I love that they have cheap production.""BUY #3: CISCOYear to Date Performance: +7%A challenging macroeconomic environment has left Cisco (CSCO) shares far behind its tech peers and the broader S&amp;P 500.The stock's 7% gain so far this year pales in comparison to the Nasdaq 100 Index’s (^NDX) 36% surge. Investors have overlooked the maker of computer networking equipment amid concern clients are cutting back on IT spending. Orders declined 23% in its most recent quarter.New Constructs CEO David Trainer told Yahoo Finance he sees the recent underperformance of Cisco as a buying opportunity, given ""terrific fundamentals with a return on invested capital (ROIC) at 15%.""Trainer added: ""The stock also boasts an attractive valuation that implies just 4% profit growth over the next decade. We think the company will do closer to 9% or 10% growth in profits.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

Customer experience remains key to achieving their organizations' goals, ranking as the second highest priority,followed by productivity, – ranked first globally – as CEOs looks to drive organizational performance. Yet, CEOs can face key barriers as they race to modernize and adopt new technologies like generative AI.IBM Corporation logo. The annual CEO study*, CEO decision-making in the age of AI, Act with intention, which incorporates a survey of 200 U.S. CEOs from multinational corporations on their response to generative AI, found three-quarters of CEO respondents believe that competitive advantage will depend on who has the most advanced generative AI. However, executives are also weighing potential risks or barriers of the technology such as bias, ethics and security. More than half (57%) of CEOs surveyed are concerned about data security and 48% worry about bias or data accuracy.There is also a disconnect between CEOs and their teams when it comes to AI readiness. Half (50%) of CEOs surveyed report they are already integrating generative AI into products and services, and 43% say they are using generative AI to inform strategic decisions. Yet, just 29% of their executive teams agree they have the in-house expertise to adopt generative AI; only 30% of non-CEO senior executives surveyed say that their organization is ready to adopt generative AI responsibly.Story continues""It has been challenging for AI to scale and operationalize, but generative AI that leverages powerful foundation models changes that dynamic,"" said Colin Tan, General Manager and Technology Leader of IBM Singapore. ""This opens up new opportunities that businesses can derive from AI, from boosting productivity, creating exceptional customer care, accelerating intelligent workflows, to spur transformation and growth. CEOs also must ensure AI is explainable, fair, robust, transparent and protects consumer data and privacy.""Key study findings include:Singapore CEOs say technology modernisation is a pressing priority and key to help deliver productivity and customer experience58% of Singapore CEOs surveyed pinpoint technology modernization as a top priority for their organization; enhancing customer experience follows as their second highest priority (51%) while productivity ranks third (44%). In contrast, global CEOs indicated productivity represirented the highest priority – ahead of technology modernisation and customer experience.For the fourth consecutive year, Singapore CEOs surveyed say technology factors remain the top external force impacting their organization over the next three years – in line with their global counterparts.Singapore CEOs are increasingly looking toward operational, technology and data leaders as strategic decision makersAdditional data gathered during the survey indicates the following:When asked which C-Suite members will make the most crucial decisions over the next three years, Singapore CEO respondents identified COOs (58%) and CFOs (57%), echoing global responses.The influence of technology leaders on decision making is growing – 38% of surveyed Singapore CEOs point to CIOs, followed by Chief Technology or Chief Digital Officer as making the most crucial decisions in their organization.U.S. CEOs* indicate they are ready to adopt generative AI, but other executives have reservationsThree out of four (75%) CEOs surveyed believe the organization with the most advanced generative AI will have competitive advantage.Half (50%) of CEOs report they are already integrating generative AI into products and services; 43% say they are using generative AI to inform strategic decisions, with 36% using the technology for operational decisions.While 69% of CEO respondents see broad benefits of generative AI across their organization, just 29% of their executive teams agree they have the in-house expertise to adopt generative AI.Only 30% of non-CEO senior executives surveyed say that their organization is ready to adopt generative AI responsibly.Generative AI is fueling workforce changes, but broader assessments of its impact on the workforce are laggingAbout 43% of surveyed U.S. CEOs say they have reduced or redeployed their workforce due to generative AI, with an additional 28% indicating they plan to do so in the next 12 months.At the same time, 46% of U.S. CEOs surveyed have hired additional workers because of generative AI, with 26% saying they have plans for more hiring ahead.Yet, fewer than one in three U.S. CEOs (28%) surveyed have assessed the potential impact of generative AI on their workforces, and 36% say they plan to do so in the next 12 months.To view the full study, visit: https://ibm.co/c-suite-study-ceo.To learn more about the top trends and strategic bets business leaders are making to boost productivity, visit https://www.ibm.com/thought-leadership/institute-business-value/en-us/report/seven-bets.*Study MethodologyThe IBM Institute for Business Value, in cooperation with Oxford Economics, interviewed 3,000 CEOs from over 30 countries and 24 industries as part of the 28th edition of the IBM C-Suite Study series.

The most advanced semiconductors today are built at the larger 3nm node.“When it comes to 2nm technology, we are focusing our efforts on Rapidus and investing a great deal of resources to this project, even sacrificing some capacity that we could have used in other research,” IBM Japan’s Chief Technology Officer Norishige Morimoto told Bloomberg News in an interview. “We want Rapidus to succeed. We want it to contribute to a stable supply of the chips we and the world need.”Rapidus is a quasi-public project that got its start last year as a venture to build out Japan’s local chipmaking capacity at a time of rising geopolitical tensions and protectionism. It has the government’s support and is led by veterans of the semiconductor supply chain, including Tetsuro Higashi, the former chairman of Tokyo Electron Ltd., and Atsuyoshi Koike, the former Japan president of Western Digital Corp.The daunting task ahead of them is to create a world-class chipmaking foundry — fabricating silicon for outside customers — to catch up with industry leader Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. within a handful of years. The duo have drawn investment from companies including Toyota Motor Corp., Sony Group Corp. and Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp. Rapidus is working with IBM and Belgium-based microelectronics research hub IMEC.Story continuesRapidus engineers have been dispatched to IBM’s Albany NanoTech Complex to design 2nm mass production lines while its factory is being built in Hokkaido, accelerating the development process. The Japanese firm expects to invest ¥5 trillion ($35 billion) in its 2nm project, roughly matching the annual outlay of TSMC and fellow leading chipmaker Samsung Electronics Co.Read more: Chip Industry Veteran Aims to Help Japan Build Its Own TSMCIBM would be open to helping Rapidus lock up further deals with major chip firms. “We won’t rule out any options as long as they match with our business needs,” Morimoto said. IBM also provides chipmaking technology to Samsung’s foundry division.“Rapidus and Samsung are on the same platform as they both use IBM technology, and it’s very possible the two can strike a win-win partnership as their business models are quite different,” Omdia analyst Akira Minamikawa said.Read more: Japan’s Rapidus Seeks Billions of Dollars to Reboot Chip SectorIBM provides Rapidus key process technology that enables 2nm chip nodes and beyond, using a new type of transistor composition called nanosheet. Jumping forward to such advanced geometries is a huge leap from Japan’s existing capacity, which trades in more mature nodes like 40nm, but Morimoto is confident in the country’s deep roster of seasoned chip engineers.Semiconductor demand is set to keep growing as a post-Covid recovery takes hold and the artificial intelligence boom drives the need for more memory and computing power.Global revenue is expected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, doubling in the space of a decade, according to Inna Skvortsova, market analyst at industry body SEMI.Presently, only Samsung and TSMC can produce the most advanced chips and there’s widespread interest — from Washington to Beijing and Brussels — in adding more redundancy to the sources of supply. Rapidus would ideally offer a third option and, moreover, should be welcomed by the industry leaders who have struggled to meet demand, Morimoto said.“We know from our own experience that providing the newest generation of chips is not something that one company can handle alone,” he said. “Both TSMC and Samsung will welcome Rapidus joining the club of cutting-edge chip manufacturers because, as things stand now, they are making customers wait. Rapidus taking some orders from them wouldn’t be a problem.”TSMC Chairman Mark Liu has said he doesn’t see Rapidus as a competitor, as the Japanese chipmaker will focus on fostering engineering talent.--With assistance from Takahiko Hyuga and Debby Wu.Most Read from Bloomberg BusinessweekHow Mobile Money Is Bringing Electricity to the World’s PoorestA Pop-Up Concert Company Gives Bands a Place to Perform, and 70% of the ProfitThe Air Jordan Drop So Hot It Blew Up an Alleged $85 Million Ponzi SchemeHow a Prison Gang Inspired by Hollywood Heists Stole $23 MillionEBT Skimmers Are Draining Millions of Dollars From the Neediest Americans©2023 Bloomberg L.P.]"

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the topic, head directly to 5 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees. Using cannabis can affect attention, memory, and learning, same as alcohol. It is understandable that employers prefer workers to be lucid during work, be it drugs or alcohol. However, workplace drug testing can only detect recent cannabis or drug use, and it does not necessarily determine potential safety problems in the future. Other substances like opioids, antidepressants, and medically prescribed marijuana can also cause impairment. If an employee offers a valid prescription, the employer has to legally accept their use of these medications. Similarly, with recreational drugs, unless employees come to work visibly stoned or with their mental faculties impaired, should it really matter to employers what they do on their own time? CBD products that don’t cause a high in users may also contain elements that trigger a positive response on a drug screening test. While many states approve of pre-employment drug testing, some instruct employers to inform applicants beforehand. An SHRM report highlighted that courts have decreed that pre-employment drug testing is not the same as medical examinations as per the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission demands that these drug tests be carried out after employees receive a conditional job acceptance. This is because the employer may need to make further medical inquiries to applicants based on the test results. Employers should also take into consideration local regulations. For example, conducting random drug tests is prohibited unless mandated by federal law in San Francisco. In California, the state constitution allows individuals the right to privacy, which means drug screenings without proper basis, such as random tests, are permitted in very exceptional circumstances. Similarly, employers must submit a written request to the labor commissioner in Connecticut, stating the reasons for performing random drug screenings, and get approval for the process.Story continuesDon't Miss: 15 States With the Biggest Drug Problems in 2023Moreover, the legalization of adult-use cannabis across a majority of states is also disrupting the “Just Say No” era when it comes to employment. One significant factor behind the decision to relax drug testing policies is the lack of young blood in the aging workforce. This extends to the federal government and military as well. Per a New York Times report, the US military has allowed 3,400 candidates who failed to meet the drug screening criteria to try for recruitment again over the last five years. Similarly, the FBI and CIA are also relaxing their drug policies and allowing the use of marijuana among job applicants. Moreover, the Biden Administration is aiming to be more lenient when it comes to security clearances, given that over half of the American population has indulged in recreational or medicinal cannabis, and most believe that it should be completely legal. According to Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin: “We don’t want to be disqualifying half of the population, tens of millions of people, for having done something that most of our recent presidents have done. You’re taking huge numbers of people off the field.”Similarly, multiple changes have been made to drug testing policies by government agencies. The CIA, beginning from April 2022, reduced the marijuana abstinence period for new candidates to just 90 days, down from one year. The FBI also lowered its marijuana abstention requirement for potential candidates from three years to one year in 2021. In December 2021, Avril D. Haines, the Director of National Intelligence, announced that past recreational marijuana use should be considered ""relevant"" but not the sole factor in determining an individual's suitability for sensitive national security positions.In this article, we discuss 25 big companies that don’t drug test employees. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Our Methodology For this article, we selected the most prominent firms whose websites don’t explicitly state the need for pre-employment drug screening or random drug testing for employees. For companies whose websites were unclear, we researched on LinkedIn, Indeed, Reddit, and Zippia, and relied on majority consensus to shortlist firms that don’t drug test employees. It is important to note that most companies reserve the right to perform drug tests on employees who are involved in workplace accidents which could normally be prevented, or individuals who show up to work with their mental faculties very clearly impaired.  25 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test EmployeesCopyright: antonioguillem / 123RF Stock PhotoBig Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees25. TwitterTwitter, an American social media company, is against drug testing for its employees. This especially became a norm during COVID-19, when remote work was encouraged. Twitter also implemented a remote work structure after the pandemic restrictions were lifted, which meant that drug testing was not necessary at all for employees.

Membership grew to an all-time record, now fully recovered from the pandemic lows. New gym openings are somewhat constrained by availability of HVAC units, but we envision the pace of growth will accelerate and that the base of gyms can still double over time from 2,000 to 4,000. We believe that EBITDA can grow at a mid-teens rate long term on a declining share count and that the trading multiple can modestly expand, which will drive continued good stock performance.”15.

We sold too soon because I was concerned that competition from internet retailers would have a permanent negative impact on Dick’s stores’ profitability. I was wrong. Dick’s stock price so far has about doubled after we sold…and its prospects have brightened!We sold even though we considered Ed Stack, Dick’s Chairm”n and CEO, a terrific retailer, a great entrepreneur and a special person. Ed had built Dick’s from three bait and tackle stores his dad started into a uniquely positioned, nationwide chain of 730 sporting goods stores. In fact, Dick’s is now the largest nationwide sporting goods chain. Ed had purchased the three bait and tackle stores, the foundation of Dick’s business, from his dad. Ed’s mother loaned him the money to buy his dad’s stores! I’m not exactly sure what that signifies. But it may have something to do with Carl Icahn’s proclamation that “everything I have is for sale except my children…and maybe my wife.”Ed and his newly appointed CEO Lauren Hobart visited us last month. Ed asked for the meeting to introduce us to Lauren, as well as to discuss the prospects for Dick’s new, large format stores with attached outdoor, student athletic fields. Lauren then described how well its new format stores were doing in two smaller communities. We also spoke about the successes of Dick’s omni-channel retailing efforts and how desirable Dick’s stores have become to shopping centers trying to lure shoppers to return to their malls.”13.

(NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”12.

The company has remained busy opening new locations with a focus on those that can support a Chipotlane, the company’s drive through concept that leverages customers’ ability to order ahead on their phones to make pick up times very short.

Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”9.

While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses.

56,7be5083e-f38e-3888-9cfc-4c50868224ae,AES,2023-07-03,Is There Now An Opportunity In The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES)?,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/now-opportunity-aes-corporation-nyse-103524504.html,1688380524,STORY,"['AES', 'AESC']","[Today we're going to take a look at the well-established The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES). The company's stock received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$25.54 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$19.74. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether AES' current trading price of US$20.73 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at AES’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change. See our latest analysis for AES Is AES Still Cheap?Good news, investors! AES is still a bargain right now. According to my valuation, the intrinsic value for the stock is $30.07, but it is currently trading at US$20.73 on the share market, meaning that there is still an opportunity to buy now. AES’s share price also seems relatively stable compared to the rest of the market, as indicated by its low beta. If you believe the share price should eventually reach its true value, a low beta could suggest it is unlikely to rapidly do so anytime soon, and once it’s there, it may be hard to fall back down into an attractive buying range.Can we expect growth from AES?earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors looking for growth in their portfolio may want to consider the prospects of a company before buying its shares. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Though in the case of AES, it is expected to deliver a relatively unexciting top-line growth of 7.0% in the next few years, which doesn’t help build up its investment thesis. Growth doesn’t appear to be a main reason for a buy decision for the company, at least in the near term.Story continuesWhat This Means For YouAre you a shareholder? Even though growth is relatively muted, since AES is currently undervalued, it may be a great time to increase your holdings in the stock. However, there are also other factors such as capital structure to consider, which could explain the current undervaluation.Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on AES for a while, now might be the time to enter the stock. Its future outlook isn’t fully reflected in the current share price yet, which means it’s not too late to buy AES. But before you make any investment decisions, consider other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to make a well-informed buy.With this in mind, we wouldn't consider investing in a stock unless we had a thorough understanding of the risks.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the history of the food service industry, good party foods to buy, innovations in the supermarket shopping experience, challenges faced by the grocery industry, rise of online grocery shopping, and go directly to 5 Easy Party Snacks to Buy for Adults. Food service has developed and evolved over the centuries, with many new ways of preparing and serving food emerging in recent years. The first evidence of the food service industry can be traced back to the Sumerian period, in 3000 BC. In ancient Mohenjo-Daro, a recent excavation in Pakistan shows evidence that people ate in restaurant-type facilities that were equipped with stone ovens and stoves for quantity food preparation. In the following centuries, the food service industry grew rapidly and became an important part of the economy. Global caloric consumption has also grown as we have been able to drastically increase food production due to agricultural mechanization. As we mentioned in our article – 20 Most Profitable Food Businesses in the World – global caloric consumption will grow from 2,789 kilocalories in 2000 per person, to 3,139 kilocalories by 2050, an increase of 12%. Good Party Foods to Buy:Everyone enjoys a good party but party planning, on the other hand, may be quite a hassle. One of the easiest ways to glamorize your food is to plate it aesthetically. A beautiful garnishing will make even the most ordinary food look mouth-watering. Providing your guests with proteins by serving meat or seafood meals is always a good idea. You can find a lot of frozen food options that are easily prepared in a few minutes. Your guests would also need some flavorful crunchies to munch on, so make sure to have snacks like nuts, crackers, chips, or other salty finger foods. It’s also important to complement items from different snack categories with sauces, and other party dips and spreads. Story continuesIf you’re worried about what food to serve your guests, we have mentioned some great ideas in this list of Easy Store-Bought Party Snacks for Adults. Innovations in the Supermarket Shopping Experience: Despite the wave of digital transformation spreading throughout the retail sector, the supermarket shopping experience has largely remained the same. In the wake of the pandemic, online grocery shopping has certainly become more popular, but the majority of the people still prefer buying groceries at physical stores. Shopping carts are an essential part of the grocery shopping experience. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced in 2022 that it was launching its smart grocery carts at a Whole Foods store in Massachusetts. The Dash Cart, introduced in 2020, tracks and tallies up items as shoppers place them in the cart, enabling them to skip the checkout line. Voice-based ordering is another trend that the supermarkets are catching up on, by offering consumers the ability to order goods through their voice-assistants and pick them up in-store. For example, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) partnered with Google before the pandemic to offer customers the ability to order groceries through Google’s voice assistant. The Just Walk Out technology by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was perhaps the biggest leap in the supermarket shopping experience in recent years. The technology allows shoppers to identify themselves upon entering a store by scanning a QR code or their palms on a scanner. After that, they shop as usual and instead of checking out at a counter, they can simply walk out of the store. Their Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) accounts are billed automatically and they receive a digital receipt onlineChallenges Faced by the Grocery Industry:The grocery industry continues to face a number of challenges, such as rising supply chain costs, labor and raw material shortages, geopolitical conflicts, changes in consumer behavior and expectations, and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis. Food prices are at an all-time high due to global inflation, with consumers reducing their overall spending. Grocery retailers today need to transform in order to navigate these challenges and meet consumer demands. Two of the largest supermarket chains in the U.S. hope to join forces as inflation pushes food prices higher. Grocery giant The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) announced plans last year to acquire Idaho-based Albertsons Companies, Inc. (NYSE:ACI) in a $24.6 billion deal. If it is approved by officials, the deal could reshape the U.S. supermarket landscape and create a corporate behemoth that collectively generates $209 billion in yearly revenue and operates nearly 5,000 stores. The acquisition, aimed, in part, to take on Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), will allow the grocers to save millions in operating costs and have stronger bargaining power with suppliers. The complex deal would pay all shareholders of Albertsons Companies, Inc. (NYSE:ACI) $34.1 a share.Rise of Online Grocery Shopping: Over the past few years, e-commerce in the American grocery industry has continued to mature and scale, mainly accelerated because of the restrictions placed during the Covid-19 pandemic. According to a study by Verified Market Research, the U.S. online grocery market size was valued at $29.4 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $59.94 billion by 2030, with a solid CAGR of 9.31% from 2024 to 2030. The main drivers of e-commerce growth during the pandemic were convenience and safety, but research indicates that consumers also value the channel’s unique features, such as product comparisons, assortment, personalized promotions, and a growing preference for comfort.  Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) was the big winner in 2022 as more and more people shifted to online grocery shopping, looking for ways to save a buck. Consumers were driven by what the researchers term ‘flight to value’, where they buy products via an ‘everyday low price’ pricing model employed at Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT).With that said, let's head over to the list of the Easiest Party Snacks to Buy for Adults.   15 Easy Party Snacks to Buy for AdultsPixabay/Public DomainMethodology:To collect data for this article, we have referred to several sources, such as Dwell &amp; Dine, Real Simple, Greatist etc., looking for easy party snack ideas for adults.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the topic, head directly to 5 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees. Using cannabis can affect attention, memory, and learning, same as alcohol. It is understandable that employers prefer workers to be lucid during work, be it drugs or alcohol. However, workplace drug testing can only detect recent cannabis or drug use, and it does not necessarily determine potential safety problems in the future. Other substances like opioids, antidepressants, and medically prescribed marijuana can also cause impairment. If an employee offers a valid prescription, the employer has to legally accept their use of these medications. Similarly, with recreational drugs, unless employees come to work visibly stoned or with their mental faculties impaired, should it really matter to employers what they do on their own time? CBD products that don’t cause a high in users may also contain elements that trigger a positive response on a drug screening test. While many states approve of pre-employment drug testing, some instruct employers to inform applicants beforehand. An SHRM report highlighted that courts have decreed that pre-employment drug testing is not the same as medical examinations as per the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission demands that these drug tests be carried out after employees receive a conditional job acceptance. This is because the employer may need to make further medical inquiries to applicants based on the test results. Employers should also take into consideration local regulations. For example, conducting random drug tests is prohibited unless mandated by federal law in San Francisco. In California, the state constitution allows individuals the right to privacy, which means drug screenings without proper basis, such as random tests, are permitted in very exceptional circumstances. Similarly, employers must submit a written request to the labor commissioner in Connecticut, stating the reasons for performing random drug screenings, and get approval for the process.Story continuesDon't Miss: 15 States With the Biggest Drug Problems in 2023Moreover, the legalization of adult-use cannabis across a majority of states is also disrupting the “Just Say No” era when it comes to employment. One significant factor behind the decision to relax drug testing policies is the lack of young blood in the aging workforce. This extends to the federal government and military as well. Per a New York Times report, the US military has allowed 3,400 candidates who failed to meet the drug screening criteria to try for recruitment again over the last five years. Similarly, the FBI and CIA are also relaxing their drug policies and allowing the use of marijuana among job applicants. Moreover, the Biden Administration is aiming to be more lenient when it comes to security clearances, given that over half of the American population has indulged in recreational or medicinal cannabis, and most believe that it should be completely legal. According to Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin: “We don’t want to be disqualifying half of the population, tens of millions of people, for having done something that most of our recent presidents have done. You’re taking huge numbers of people off the field.”Similarly, multiple changes have been made to drug testing policies by government agencies. The CIA, beginning from April 2022, reduced the marijuana abstinence period for new candidates to just 90 days, down from one year. The FBI also lowered its marijuana abstention requirement for potential candidates from three years to one year in 2021. In December 2021, Avril D. Haines, the Director of National Intelligence, announced that past recreational marijuana use should be considered ""relevant"" but not the sole factor in determining an individual's suitability for sensitive national security positions.In this article, we discuss 25 big companies that don’t drug test employees. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Our Methodology For this article, we selected the most prominent firms whose websites don’t explicitly state the need for pre-employment drug screening or random drug testing for employees. For companies whose websites were unclear, we researched on LinkedIn, Indeed, Reddit, and Zippia, and relied on majority consensus to shortlist firms that don’t drug test employees. It is important to note that most companies reserve the right to perform drug tests on employees who are involved in workplace accidents which could normally be prevented, or individuals who show up to work with their mental faculties very clearly impaired.  25 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test EmployeesCopyright: antonioguillem / 123RF Stock PhotoBig Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees25.

The company reported system-wide same-store sales increased 8.2%, raised estimates for growth in net income, and authorized another large share repurchase. Membership grew to an all-time record, now fully recovered from the pandemic lows. New gym openings are somewhat constrained by availability of HVAC units, but we envision the pace of growth will accelerate and that the base of gyms can still double over time from 2,000 to 4,000. We believe that EBITDA can grow at a mid-teens rate long term on a declining share count and that the trading multiple can modestly expand, which will drive continued good stock performance.”15.

(NASDAQ:DLTR) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Our largest individual detractors were Brookfield Corporation, Alphabet, Amazon, Black Knight, and Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR). Alphabet’s price-to-earnings multiple continues to contract due to concerns about the potential for revenue to be more economically sensitive than it has been historically, given the vast size of the business today. At Amazon, cost pressures and slowing AWS growth weighed on its share price. The regulatory status of Intercontinental Exchange’s pending acquisition offer for Black Knight remains a concern, while in the interim, business conditions have deteriorated given the slowdown in the mortgage market.

(NYSE:DKS) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. was the first stock Michael recommended to us shortly after he joined Baron Capital in 2003. Dick’s share price has since increased about nine-fold. Unfortunately, we sold our investment in Dick’s about six years ago and, although it was a successful investment, we did not realize the full benefit of Michael’s recommendation. We sold too soon because I was concerned that competition from internet retailers would have a permanent negative impact on Dick’s stores’ profitability. I was wrong. Dick’s stock price so far has about doubled after we sold…and its prospects have brightened!We sold even though we considered Ed Stack, Dick’s Chairm”n and CEO, a terrific retailer, a great entrepreneur and a special person. Ed had built Dick’s from three bait and tackle stores his dad started into a uniquely positioned, nationwide chain of 730 sporting goods stores. In fact, Dick’s is now the largest nationwide sporting goods chain. Ed had purchased the three bait and tackle stores, the foundation of Dick’s business, from his dad. Ed’s mother loaned him the money to buy his dad’s stores! I’m not exactly sure what that signifies. But it may have something to do with Carl Icahn’s proclamation that “everything I have is for sale except my children…and maybe my wife.”Ed and his newly appointed CEO Lauren Hobart visited us last month. Ed asked for the meeting to introduce us to Lauren, as well as to discuss the prospects for Dick’s new, large format stores with attached outdoor, student athletic fields. Lauren then described how well its new format stores were doing in two smaller communities. We also spoke about the successes of Dick’s omni-channel retailing efforts and how desirable Dick’s stores have become to shopping centers trying to lure shoppers to return to their malls.”13.

(NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”12.

Same store sales were positive with better-than-expected margins resulting in earnings for the quarter ahead of expectations. At the same time, Target provided guidance for 2023 that was below expectations, which sets them up to meet or exceed expectations after a difficult 2022. Target expects same store sales for 2023 to range from a low single digit decline to a low single digit increase, with operating margins in the 4.5% to 5% range. We continue to view Target as well positioned for long-term growth with its strong owned brand strategy and omnichannel offerings.”11. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

Despite needing to raise prices by double digit rates to offset inflation in food prices and higher labor costs, the company has seen resilient customer demand. While digital orders have fallen from peak COVID levels, digital sales stabilized in the fourth quarter at approximately 40% of all orders or twice the volume seen pre-COVID. The company has remained busy opening new locations with a focus on those that can support a Chipotlane, the company’s drive through concept that leverages customers’ ability to order ahead on their phones to make pick up times very short.

Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”9.

While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees.  Suggested articles:Top 20 Countries With Highest Drug Consumption20 Most Commonly Used Recreational Drugs in America15 Most Profitable Drugs In The World Disclosure: None. 25 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Given that the market rewards strong financials in the long-term, we wonder if that is the case in this instance. In this article, we decided to focus on Amphenol's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In simpler terms, it measures the profitability of a company in relation to shareholder's equity. View our latest analysis for Amphenol How Is ROE Calculated?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Amphenol is:26% = US$1.9b ÷ US$7.4b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.26 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.Amphenol's Earnings Growth And 26% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that Amphenol has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 12% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. This probably laid the groundwork for Amphenol's moderate 17% net income growth seen over the past five years.As a next step, we compared Amphenol's net income growth with the industry and found that the company has a similar growth figure when compared with the industry average growth rate of 16% in the same period.Story continuespast-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about Amphenol's's valuation, check out this gauge of its price-to-earnings ratio, as compared to its industry.Is Amphenol Making Efficient Use Of Its Profits?Amphenol has a healthy combination of a moderate three-year median payout ratio of 25% (or a retention ratio of 75%) and a respectable amount of growth in earnings as we saw above, meaning that the company has been making efficient use of its profits.Additionally, Amphenol has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years which means that the company is pretty serious about sharing its profits with shareholders. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 28%. Accordingly, forecasts suggest that Amphenol's future ROE will be 23% which is again, similar to the current ROE.ConclusionOverall, we are quite pleased with Amphenol's performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see substantial growth in its earnings. That being so, a study of the latest analyst forecasts show that the company is expected to see a slowdown in its future earnings growth.

65,4e98f054-c351-3867-a16a-acf73d45c845,VZ,2023-07-03,Don't Buy Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) For Its Next Dividend Without Doing These Checks,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/dont-buy-verizon-communications-inc-100637811.html,1688378797,STORY,['VZ'],"[For many investors, the main point of stock picking is to generate higher returns than the overall market. But its virtually certain that sometimes you will buy stocks that fall short of the market average returns. We regret to report that long term Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) shareholders have had that experience, with the share price dropping 42% in three years, versus a market return of about 39%. And more recent buyers are having a tough time too, with a drop of 36% in the last year. Furthermore, it's down 16% in about a quarter. That's not much fun for holders.Since Verizon Communications has shed US$11b from its value in the past 7 days, let's see if the longer term decline has been driven by the business' economics. Check out our latest analysis for Verizon Communications While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Although the share price is down over three years, Verizon Communications actually managed to grow EPS by 4.9% per year in that time. Given the share price reaction, one might suspect that EPS is not a good guide to the business performance during the period (perhaps due to a one-off loss or gain). Alternatively, growth expectations may have been unreasonable in the past.After considering the numbers, we'd posit that the the market had higher expectations of EPS growth, three years back. However, taking a look at other business metrics might shed a bit more light on the share price action.We note that the dividend seems healthy enough, so that probably doesn't explain the share price drop. Verizon Communications has maintained its top line over three years, so we doubt that has shareholders worried. So it might be worth looking at how revenue growth over time, in greater detail.Story continuesThe graphic below depicts how earnings and revenue have changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-and-revenue-growthVerizon Communications is a well known stock, with plenty of analyst coverage, suggesting some visibility into future growth. You can see what analysts are predicting for Verizon Communications in this interactive graph of future profit estimates.What About Dividends?As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. In the case of Verizon Communications, it has a TSR of -32% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!A Different PerspectiveVerizon Communications shareholders are down 32% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 18%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Unfortunately, last year's performance may indicate unresolved challenges, given that it was worse than the annualised loss of 4% over the last half decade. Generally speaking long term share price weakness can be a bad sign, though contrarian investors might want to research the stock in hope of a turnaround. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Verizon Communications better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks, for example - Verizon Communications has   2 warning signs  (and 1 which makes us a bit uncomfortable)  we think you should know about.Of course Verizon Communications may not be the best stock to buy.

But it's been a pretty ho-hum year for the rest of the index, which has been dominated by some big-name laggards.""Part of it, in our view, is the average stocks better reflect some of the broader macroeconomic uncertainty and significant increase in the Fed funds rates over the past year,"" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner tells Yahoo Finance.Powered mostly by hype around new generative AI technology, seven stocks have fueled most of the S&amp;P 500's 15% year-to-date advance, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.Another view from Goldman Sachs (chart below): 15 of the biggest companies have driven 86% of the S&amp;P 500's return year-to-date.Nvidia (AI hype) and Meta (cost-cutting and AI hype) have led the charge for the S&amp;P 500 with respective gains of 180% and 133%. Tesla shares are up 109% (AI hype and strong EV demand).Apple is up 46% on optimism around some pricey new VR goggles. Amazon is oddly up 52% despite not announcing anything on the AI front and continuing to have poor quarters. And Microsoft and Alphabet have traded blows on AI developments, in the process driving respective stock price gains of 39% and 34%.""These stocks have benefited from coming into the year in an oversold position, the excitement around AI, and earnings revision trends that have turned higher,"" Lerner says. ""Also, even if the economy slows as we expect, it’s likely that companies will continue to spend on tech, or fear of being left behind. That should be good for tech earnings on a relative basis.""But non-tech companies haven't fared quite as well. CVS Health is down 26%, Moderna is off 34% and VF Corp is down 31%.Will the rest of the S&amp;P 500 finally draw more interest from investors in the second half of the year? Pros like Lerner and BMO's Brian Belski expect a modest broadening out of the market's rally as investors seek out bargains and bet on no rate hikes in 2024.Story continues""The bogeyman of narrow market breadth has started to broaden out and is a trend we expect will continue,"" says Belski.Here are three relative laggards from the S&amp;P 500 this year that could gain favor on the Street.BUY #1: AT&amp;TYear to Date Performance: -13%AT&amp;T (T) has had a challenging first half of the year as declining subscriber growth, softer-than-expected sales and disappointing free cash flow levels kept investors away from the telecom giant.But despite those headwinds, David Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar, told Yahoo Finance that AT&amp;T is a top pick.""AT&amp;T is at the intersection of being a deep value play,"" Sekera said. ""Fundamentally, it’s in a relatively strong position. We rate the company with a narrow economic moat, which means it has long-term structural cost advantages.""Added positive: AT&amp;T's CFO Pascal Desroches told Yahoo Finance Live that key parts of the business have begun to turn the corner.BUY #2: OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUMYear to Date Performance: -8%Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the Houston-based oil company backed by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, has surprisingly been left in the dust.Shares are off more than 8% year to date amid lingering worries of softening oil demand against a backdrop of sluggish global economic growth. And the oil producer is not alone. The S&amp;P 500's Energy Select Sector (XLE) is down 10% year to date following the sector's massive 57.6% gain last year.Occidental’s largest shareholder, Buffett has protected the stock from the worst of this year's energy sector sell-off. He boosted his stake in the company to above 25% after buying 2.1 million more shares worth about $123 million.So, as Warren Buffett doubles down on Occidental, Portfolio Wealth Advisors CEO Lee Munson sees an opportunity to bet on the ‘beaten up’ stock too.""Back in 2019 they bought Anadarko – which means they own half the Permian Basin,"" Munson told Yahoo Finance Live. ""The Permian is the crown jewel. It’s cheap to extract, and once you pump it all out you can frack it to draw blood from a stone – printing money… I love that they have cheap production.""BUY #3: CISCOYear to Date Performance: +7%A challenging macroeconomic environment has left Cisco (CSCO) shares far behind its tech peers and the broader S&amp;P 500.The stock's 7% gain so far this year pales in comparison to the Nasdaq 100 Index’s (^NDX) 36% surge. Investors have overlooked the maker of computer networking equipment amid concern clients are cutting back on IT spending. Orders declined 23% in its most recent quarter.New Constructs CEO David Trainer told Yahoo Finance he sees the recent underperformance of Cisco as a buying opportunity, given ""terrific fundamentals with a return on invested capital (ROIC) at 15%.""Trainer added: ""The stock also boasts an attractive valuation that implies just 4% profit growth over the next decade. We think the company will do closer to 9% or 10% growth in profits.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.

But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. For example, the The Travelers Companies, Inc. (NYSE:TRV) share price is up 52% in the last three years, clearly besting the market return of around 35% (not including dividends). On the other hand, the returns haven't been quite so good recently, with shareholders up just 3.7% , including dividends .Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. View our latest analysis for Travelers Companies While the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Travelers Companies was able to grow its EPS at 8.8% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is lower than the 15% average annual increase in the share price. This indicates that the market is feeling more optimistic on the stock, after the last few years of progress. That's not necessarily surprising considering the three-year track record of earnings growth.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthThis free interactive report on Travelers Companies' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock.

A lukewarm $60 million debut in North America,AP Finance,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/indiana-jones-box-office-destiny-165122838.html,1688316682,STORY,['DIS'],"[Indiana Jones, and executives at the Walt Disney Co. and Lucasfilm, made a somewhat dispiriting discovery this weekend. Moviegoers didn't rush to the theater in significant numbers to see “ Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny"" and say goodbye to Harrison Ford as the iconic archaeologist.The film, reportedly budgeted north of $250 million, came in on the lower end of projections with $60 million in ticket sales from 4,600 North American theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday.Including $70 million from international showings in 52 markets, “Dial of Destiny” celebrated a $130 million global opening. It easily earned the No. 1 title but was not the high-rolling sendoff for one of modern cinema’s most iconic actor/character pairings that anyone hoped. Disney is projecting that it will make $82 million domestically through the fourth of July holiday and $152 million globally.“Dial of Destiny” is the long-delayed fifth installment in the Steven Spielberg/George Lucas-created adventure series that began in 1981, and the first Spielberg himself hasn’t directed. Veteran James Mangold stepped in to take the reins overseeing the Spielberg-approved script, which finds an older Dr. Jones retiring from his university job and swept up on a new adventure with his goddaughter Helena (Phoebe Waller-Bridge).“It’s impressive that a franchise that’s over 40 years old is No. 1 at the box office. But there's no question there were higher hopes for the debut of this movie,” said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. “This is Indiana Jones. This is a summer movie icon.”The film made its splashy premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May, with a fitting celebration of Ford, who has said this was his last time playing the character.But then it was hit with lukewarm reviews. This was an unexpected and unwelcome hurdle, considering it was coming after the maligned fourth film, 2008’s “Indiana Jones and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull.” Another contributing snag was that a significant portion of the target audience, older viewers, don't tend to buy many tickets on opening weekend for big blockbusters. But even “Crystal Skull,” budgeted at a reported $185 million, managed to gross over $790 million.Story continuesHarrison Ford poses for photographers upon arrival at the premiere of the film 'Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny' on Monday, June 26, 2023 in London. (Scott Garfitt/Invision/AP)“Sometimes reviews don’t matter, but the sentiment coming out of Cannes was very powerful,” Dergarabedian said. “It set off a narrative where people were already feeling disappointed and they hadn’t even seen it.”Second place went to “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse” with $11.5 million, bringing its domestic total to around $340 million. “Elemental” landed in third place with $11.3 million.Aside from “Dial of Destiny,” the weekend's other main new opener was the animated “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken,” which debuted in sixth place with $5.2 million.“Dial of Destiny’s” underwhelming debut comes just a few weeks after both Warner Bros.’ “The Flash” and Disney/Pixar’s “Elemental” had lackluster openings in North America. “Elemental,” like Indy 5, also premiered at Cannes to middling reception.And yet, “Elemental” in its three weeks in theaters has held on much better than “The Flash,” which plummeted again to $5 million, bringing its domestic total to $99.3 million. Disney also saw similarly promising holds with “The Little Mermaid,” now at over $280 million domestically and “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3"" which has grossed over $345 million. After the holiday, Disney will be responsible for nearly half of the summer box office earnings.“The entire story isn’t told on the opening weekend,” Dergarabedian said.Disney has a “clear weekend” ahead with no competing blockbusters, when studio heads can reasonably hope for more families and older audiences to buy tickets. But things will only get more challenging for “Dial of Destiny” in the coming weeks with a crowded July. “Mission: Impossible-Dead Reckoning Part I” opens on July 12, followed by “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie” on July 21.“The ups and downs at the box office are giving us whiplash,” Dergarabedian said. “And we’re still on the cusp of some of the biggest movies of the summer.”Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday.1. “Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny,” $60 million.2. “Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse,” $11.5 million.3. “Elemental,” $11.3 million.4. “No Hard Feelings,” $7.5 million.5. “Transformers: Rise of the Beasts,” $7 million.6. “Ruby Gillman, Teenage Kraken,” $5.2 million.7. “The Little Mermaid,” $5.2 million.8. “The Flash,” $5 million.9. “Asteroid City,” $3.8 million.10. “Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3,” $1.8 million.—Follow AP Film Writer Lindsey Bahr on Twitter: www.twitter.com/ldbahr.]"

82,10135f4e-ab1f-3289-b3d1-c89b3bc4bae9,CL,2023-07-03,Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) Has Announced That It Will Be Increasing Its Dividend To $0.48,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/colgate-palmolive-nyse-cl-announced-124903363.html,1688302143,STORY,['CL'],"[Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) has announced that it will be increasing its dividend from last year's comparable payment on the 15th of August to $0.48. This takes the annual payment to 2.5% of the current stock price, which is about average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Colgate-Palmolive Colgate-Palmolive's Payment Has Solid Earnings CoverageUnless the payments are sustainable, the dividend yield doesn't mean too much. Based on the last payment, Colgate-Palmolive's profits didn't cover the dividend, but the company was generating enough cash instead. Given that the dividend is a cash outflow, we think that cash is more important than accounting measures of profit when assessing the dividend, so this is a mitigating factor.Over the next year, EPS is forecast to expand by 100.2%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio will be 51%, which would make us comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend, despite the levels currently being quite high.historic-dividendColgate-Palmolive Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has a sustained record of paying dividends with very little fluctuation. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $1.24 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.92. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 4.5% per annum over that time. Slow and steady dividend growth might not sound that exciting, but dividends have been stable for ten years, which we think makes this a fairly attractive offer.Colgate-Palmolive May Find It Hard To Grow The DividendInvestors who have held shares in the company for the past few years will be happy with the dividend income they have received. Let's not jump to conclusions as things might not be as good as they appear on the surface. In the last five years, Colgate-Palmolive's earnings per share has shrunk at approximately 4.1% per annum. Declining earnings will inevitably lead to the company paying a lower dividend in line with lower profits. It's not all bad news though, as the earnings are predicted to rise over the next 12 months - we would just be a bit cautious until this can turn into a longer term trend.Story continuesOur Thoughts On Colgate-Palmolive's DividendOverall, we always like to see the dividend being raised, but we don't think Colgate-Palmolive will make a great income stock. The company is generating plenty of cash, but we still think the dividend is a bit high for comfort. We would probably look elsewhere for an income investment.Market movements attest to how highly valued a consistent dividend policy is compared to one which is more unpredictable. However, there are other things to consider for investors when analysing stock performance.

Sometimes these stories can cloud the minds of investors, leading them to invest with their emotions rather than on the merit of good company fundamentals. While a well funded company may sustain losses for years, it will need to generate a profit eventually, or else investors will move on and the company will wither away.So if this idea of high risk and high reward doesn't suit, you might be more interested in profitable, growing companies, like Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN). Even if this company is fairly valued by the market, investors would agree that generating consistent profits will continue to provide Devon Energy with the means to add long-term value to shareholders. View our latest analysis for Devon Energy How Fast Is Devon Energy Growing Its Earnings Per Share?Devon Energy has undergone a massive growth in earnings per share over the last three years. So much so that this three year growth rate wouldn't be a fair assessment of the company's future. Thus, it makes sense to focus on more recent growth rates, instead. In impressive fashion, Devon Energy's EPS grew from US$5.33 to US$9.31, over the previous 12 months. It's not often a company can achieve year-on-year growth of 75%.It's often helpful to take a look at earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) margins, as well as revenue growth, to get another take on the quality of the company's growth. Devon Energy shareholders can take confidence from the fact that EBIT margins are up from 29% to 44%, and revenue is growing. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.In the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers.earnings-and-revenue-historyThe trick, as an investor, is to find companies that are going to perform well in the future, not just in the past. While crystal balls don't exist, you can check our visualization of consensus analyst forecasts for Devon Energy's future EPS 100% free.Story continuesAre Devon Energy Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?Insider interest in a company always sparks a bit of intrigue and many investors are on the lookout for companies where insiders are putting their money where their mouth is. That's because insider buying often indicates that those closest to the company have confidence that the share price will perform well. However, small purchases are not always indicative of conviction, and insiders don't always get it right.It's pleasing to note that insiders spent US$2.4m buying Devon Energy shares, over the last year, without reporting any share sales whatsoever. Knowing this, Devon Energy will have have all eyes on them in anticipation for the what could happen in the near future. We also note that it was the Executive VP &amp; COO, Clay Gaspar, who made the biggest single acquisition, paying US$1m for shares at about US$49.98 each.The good news, alongside the insider buying, for Devon Energy bulls is that insiders (collectively) have a meaningful investment in the stock. Indeed, they have a considerable amount of wealth invested in it, currently valued at US$191m. While that is a lot of skin in the game, we note this holding only totals to 0.6% of the business, which is a result of the company being so large. So despite their percentage holding being low, company management still have plenty of reasons to deliver the best outcomes for investors.Does Devon Energy Deserve A Spot On Your Watchlist?Devon Energy's earnings have taken off in quite an impressive fashion. To make matters even better, the company insiders who know the company best have put their faith in the its future and have been buying more stock. This quick rundown suggests that the business may be of good quality, and also at an inflection point, so maybe Devon Energy deserves timely attention. However, before you get too excited we've discovered 4 warning signs for Devon Energy (2 are a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of.There are plenty of other companies that have insiders buying up shares.

85,a92b2781-348c-3b4a-870f-7dbdaabb2a9f,URI,2023-07-03,3 Bargain Stocks You Don’t Want to Miss in 2023,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-bargain-stocks-don-t-212539256.html,1687814739,STORY,"['CNC', 'URI']","[Year-to-date, market indices have rallied significantly, led by the magnificent seven. As of this writing, the Nasdaq 100 is up 36%, whereas the S&amp;P 500 is up 13%. Despite the rally in the indices, not all stocks have participated. 2022’s winning sectors have been laggards and are reasonable hunting grounds for bargain stocks for 2023.In the first half, market outperformance has been concentrated in technology. Utilities, healthcare, and energy have underperformed as investors have chased technology and consumer discretionary stocks. At the same time, financials have seen increased volatility since the start of the banking turmoil and trade at significant discounts to book value. However, despite the cheap valuations, it’s advisable to avoid banks. Their commercial real estate portfolios and potentially stringent capital requirements ahead pose significant risks.Traditionally defensive healthcare presents better prospects. In addition to the underperformance, most healthcare stocks are now affordable stocks with high potential. Moreover, the sector enjoys multiple tailwinds, such as increased healthcare spending and an aging population. Another sector – industrials – had a sell-off in March due to recession fears and is only starting to recover. Notably, the industry is a significant reshoring and renewables beneficiary. These trends are in their early innings and can sustain demand for specific industrial goods and services.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsThese bargain stocks for 2023 have lagged behind the indices. Going forward, each has a secular trend backing its growth outlook. Buy them at these bargain prices created by short-term challenges.United Rentals (URI)Bargain Stocks for 2023Source: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.comUnited Rentals (NYSE:URI) is the largest equipment rental company in the world. After peaking at $479 in early March, the stock sharply declined. The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the ensuing banking turmoil certainly played a role. Also, some investors started anticipating tighter lending that would negatively impact construction projects.Story continuesWhile a recession could still be on the horizon, URI stock has some positive catalysts. First, it stands as a massive beneficiary of the reshoring trend. After the supply chain issues from Covid-19 and the latest China-Taiwan tensions, the U.S. government and companies are trying to rebuild local supply chains.Construction projects will soar as companies take advantage of the Inflation Reduction and Chips Act to bring back manufacturing capacity to the U.S. URI is a play on this theme. For now, the market doesn’t appreciate these catalysts, making it one of the top bargain stocks for 2023.Financial results have been solid. In 1Q 2023, revenues grew 26.0% year-over-year (YOY), supported by broad-based demand in end markets. Management was optimistic and reiterated their 2023 outlook, pointing out business momentum and increased customer visibility. They expect $2.1 billion to $2.35 billion in free cash flow in 2023. Thus, the stock trades at 14 times the fiscal year (FY) 2023 FCF. And in terms of price-to-earnings (P/E), the forward multiple is 9. At such bargain prices and considering the reshoring trend, URI stock is one of the must-buy bargain stocks in the industrial sector.Centene Corporation (CNC)Bargain Stocks for 2023Source: Valeri Potapova / Shutterstock.comThis St. Louis, Missouri-based company provides managed healthcare insurance in the U.S. As of Dec. 31, Centene (NYSE:CNC) managed care had over 27.1 million members. CNC stock has had a rough start to the year, down 19% YTD. The rotation from defensive sectors to technology and growth led to a first-quarter sell-off. Then, recent comments by peer UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH) about surging procedures for Medicare Advantage patients led to a broad-based self-off among healthcare plan names. According to Well Fargo analysts, the sell-off is an opportunity. Although increased procedures will pressure costs, the impact on earnings will be minimal. The analysts expect a minimal -2.4% impact on Centene’s EPS.Despite these recent fears, Centene is one of the best bargain stocks for 2023. It’s cheap and long-term fundamentals have never been better. Based on management’s FY2023 guidance of $6.40 in adjusted EPS, the stock trades at a forward P/E of 10. Besides, Centene will grow earnings over the long term due to secular healthcare tailwinds. According to CMS, Medicaid spending will average 5.6% annual growth between 2021 – 2030. And Medicare outlays will increase from $865 billion in 2021 to $1.5 trillion by 2029.It’s not surprising that management expects to benefit from these trends. As CEO Sarah M. London outlined in Q1 2023 earnings, “We remain confident in our ability to deliver 12-15% long-term adjusted earnings compound annual growth in the back half of the decade.”Brookfield Corporation (BN)Bargain Stocks for 2023Source: ShutterstockBrookfield Corporation (NYSE:BN) is a Canadian-based investment firm. The company owns and operates thousands of global real assets in real estate, pipelines, power generation and transmission, intermodal shipping, and communications infrastructure.The current risk estate crisis is hitting Brookfield hard. Indeed, the firm is a major player in the sector, with over 7000 properties globally. A portion of its portfolio is in troubled office markets such as San Francisco and Washington, D.C. In April, the firm defaulted on several of its properties. Walking away from these mortgages has heightened investor concern.Despite the gloom, Brookfield is among the top bargain stocks for 2023. From a fundamental standpoint, Brookfield’s real estate portfolio is solid. In a CNBC interview in May, CEO Bruce Flatt disclosed that troubled office properties were about 5% of their real estate portfolio. The rest was in quality real estate such as trophy or Class A office, industrial, hotels, and high-end retail. Per Q1 2023 earnings, its office assets had an 86% occupancy rate, and NOI increased by $56 million YOY. Moreover, the company is signing record-high lease prices on newly completed properties such as Two Manhattan West.Finally, the company is widely diversified in renewable power and transmission, infrastructure, insurance, private equity, credit, and asset management businesses. Brookfield is highly undervalued, considering its ownership interests in other publicly traded issues. It owns 75% of Brookfield Asset Management (NYSE:BAM), 48% of Brookfield Renewable Partners (NYSE:BEP), 27% of Brookfield Infrastructure Partners (NYSE:BIP), and 65% of Brookfield Business Partners (NYSE:BBU).Buying BN stock here provides a significant margin of safety. BAM, its crown jewel, will continue to grow assets under management as institutions shift to alternative asset investing. And the rest of the portfolio holds quality assets that will generate increasing cash flows for decades.On the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the topic, head directly to 5 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees. Using cannabis can affect attention, memory, and learning, same as alcohol. It is understandable that employers prefer workers to be lucid during work, be it drugs or alcohol. However, workplace drug testing can only detect recent cannabis or drug use, and it does not necessarily determine potential safety problems in the future. Other substances like opioids, antidepressants, and medically prescribed marijuana can also cause impairment. If an employee offers a valid prescription, the employer has to legally accept their use of these medications. Similarly, with recreational drugs, unless employees come to work visibly stoned or with their mental faculties impaired, should it really matter to employers what they do on their own time? CBD products that don’t cause a high in users may also contain elements that trigger a positive response on a drug screening test. While many states approve of pre-employment drug testing, some instruct employers to inform applicants beforehand. An SHRM report highlighted that courts have decreed that pre-employment drug testing is not the same as medical examinations as per the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission demands that these drug tests be carried out after employees receive a conditional job acceptance. This is because the employer may need to make further medical inquiries to applicants based on the test results. Employers should also take into consideration local regulations. For example, conducting random drug tests is prohibited unless mandated by federal law in San Francisco. In California, the state constitution allows individuals the right to privacy, which means drug screenings without proper basis, such as random tests, are permitted in very exceptional circumstances. Similarly, employers must submit a written request to the labor commissioner in Connecticut, stating the reasons for performing random drug screenings, and get approval for the process.Story continuesDon't Miss: 15 States With the Biggest Drug Problems in 2023Moreover, the legalization of adult-use cannabis across a majority of states is also disrupting the “Just Say No” era when it comes to employment. One significant factor behind the decision to relax drug testing policies is the lack of young blood in the aging workforce. This extends to the federal government and military as well. Per a New York Times report, the US military has allowed 3,400 candidates who failed to meet the drug screening criteria to try for recruitment again over the last five years. Similarly, the FBI and CIA are also relaxing their drug policies and allowing the use of marijuana among job applicants. Moreover, the Biden Administration is aiming to be more lenient when it comes to security clearances, given that over half of the American population has indulged in recreational or medicinal cannabis, and most believe that it should be completely legal. According to Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin: “We don’t want to be disqualifying half of the population, tens of millions of people, for having done something that most of our recent presidents have done. You’re taking huge numbers of people off the field.”Similarly, multiple changes have been made to drug testing policies by government agencies. The CIA, beginning from April 2022, reduced the marijuana abstinence period for new candidates to just 90 days, down from one year. The FBI also lowered its marijuana abstention requirement for potential candidates from three years to one year in 2021. In December 2021, Avril D. Haines, the Director of National Intelligence, announced that past recreational marijuana use should be considered ""relevant"" but not the sole factor in determining an individual's suitability for sensitive national security positions.In this article, we discuss 25 big companies that don’t drug test employees. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Our Methodology For this article, we selected the most prominent firms whose websites don’t explicitly state the need for pre-employment drug screening or random drug testing for employees. For companies whose websites were unclear, we researched on LinkedIn, Indeed, Reddit, and Zippia, and relied on majority consensus to shortlist firms that don’t drug test employees. It is important to note that most companies reserve the right to perform drug tests on employees who are involved in workplace accidents which could normally be prevented, or individuals who show up to work with their mental faculties very clearly impaired.  25 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test EmployeesCopyright: antonioguillem / 123RF Stock PhotoBig Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees25. TwitterTwitter, an American social media company, is against drug testing for its employees. This especially became a norm during COVID-19, when remote work was encouraged. Twitter also implemented a remote work structure after the pandemic restrictions were lifted, which meant that drug testing was not necessary at all for employees. However, ever since Elon Musk took over the company on October 27, 2022, the future of the company and its policies – including drug testing – remain uncertain. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Netflix, Inc.

The company owns, manages, and franchises fitness centers under the Planet Fitness brand. It is one of the top companies that do not believe in employee drug testing. Planet Fitness, Inc.

(NYSE:PLNT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT), the leading franchiser and operator of low-cost fitness centers, rose after reporting strong results. The company reported system-wide same-store sales increased 8.2%, raised estimates for growth in net income, and authorized another large share repurchase. Membership grew to an all-time record, now fully recovered from the pandemic lows. New gym openings are somewhat constrained by availability of HVAC units, but we envision the pace of growth will accelerate and that the base of gyms can still double over time from 2,000 to 4,000. We believe that EBITDA can grow at a mid-teens rate long term on a declining share count and that the trading multiple can modestly expand, which will drive continued good stock performance.”15.

(NASDAQ:DLTR) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Our largest individual detractors were Brookfield Corporation, Alphabet, Amazon, Black Knight, and Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR). Alphabet’s price-to-earnings multiple continues to contract due to concerns about the potential for revenue to be more economically sensitive than it has been historically, given the vast size of the business today. At Amazon, cost pressures and slowing AWS growth weighed on its share price. The regulatory status of Intercontinental Exchange’s pending acquisition offer for Black Knight remains a concern, while in the interim, business conditions have deteriorated given the slowdown in the mortgage market. Lastly, Dollar Tree’s margin outlook disappointed as management is investing to drive traffic to their stores and improve Family Dollar operations.”14. DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc.

(NYSE:DKS) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. was the first stock Michael recommended to us shortly after he joined Baron Capital in 2003. Dick’s share price has since increased about nine-fold. Unfortunately, we sold our investment in Dick’s about six years ago and, although it was a successful investment, we did not realize the full benefit of Michael’s recommendation. We sold too soon because I was concerned that competition from internet retailers would have a permanent negative impact on Dick’s stores’ profitability. I was wrong. Dick’s stock price so far has about doubled after we sold…and its prospects have brightened!We sold even though we considered Ed Stack, Dick’s Chairm”n and CEO, a terrific retailer, a great entrepreneur and a special person. Ed had built Dick’s from three bait and tackle stores his dad started into a uniquely positioned, nationwide chain of 730 sporting goods stores. In fact, Dick’s is now the largest nationwide sporting goods chain. Ed had purchased the three bait and tackle stores, the foundation of Dick’s business, from his dad. Ed’s mother loaned him the money to buy his dad’s stores! I’m not exactly sure what that signifies. But it may have something to do with Carl Icahn’s proclamation that “everything I have is for sale except my children…and maybe my wife.”Ed and his newly appointed CEO Lauren Hobart visited us last month. Ed asked for the meeting to introduce us to Lauren, as well as to discuss the prospects for Dick’s new, large format stores with attached outdoor, student athletic fields. Lauren then described how well its new format stores were doing in two smaller communities. We also spoke about the successes of Dick’s omni-channel retailing efforts and how desirable Dick’s stores have become to shopping centers trying to lure shoppers to return to their malls.”13.

(NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”12.

Same store sales were positive with better-than-expected margins resulting in earnings for the quarter ahead of expectations.

While digital orders have fallen from peak COVID levels, digital sales stabilized in the fourth quarter at approximately 40% of all orders or twice the volume seen pre-COVID. The company has remained busy opening new locations with a focus on those that can support a Chipotlane, the company’s drive through concept that leverages customers’ ability to order ahead on their phones to make pick up times very short.

Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”9.

While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees.  Suggested articles:Top 20 Countries With Highest Drug Consumption20 Most Commonly Used Recreational Drugs in America15 Most Profitable Drugs In The World Disclosure: None. 25 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Oracle Step By Step Through The CalculationWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$10.3bUS$13.4bUS$16.8bUS$21.8bUS$23.5bUS$24.8bUS$26.0bUS$27.0bUS$27.8bUS$28.7bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x16Analyst x16Analyst x7Analyst x1Analyst x1Est @ 5.58%Est @ 4.54%Est @ 3.81%Est @ 3.30%Est @ 2.94% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 8.9% US$9.5kUS$11.3kUS$13.0kUS$15.5kUS$15.3kUS$14.9kUS$14.3kUS$13.6kUS$12.9kUS$12.2k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$132bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.1%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 8.9%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$29b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (8.9%– 2.1%) = US$428bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$428b÷ ( 1 + 8.9%)10= US$182bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$314b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$119, the company appears around fair value at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out.dcfImportant AssumptionsWe would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Oracle as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 8.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.151. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for OracleStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.Debt is well covered by earnings.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Software market.OpportunityAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/E ratio compared to estimated Fair P/E ratio.ThreatDebt is not well covered by operating cash flow.Annual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.Looking Ahead:Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result.

Never miss another market-moving alert.U.S. government mulling new regulations on AI: reportAI chip stocks Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) lost ground Wednesday after a Wall Street Journal report said the Biden administration is contemplating imposing fresh limitations on the export of artificial intelligence (AI) chips to China.The move stems from growing apprehensions surrounding the potential dominance of this technology by U.S. adversaries.A move could be made by the Commerce Department to stop the shipments of AI chips made by Nvidia and other chip makers to customers in China as early as July, the report added. The ban would include the sale of Nvidia's A800 chips without a license.Despite the latest news, Citi analysts believe AI demand will exceed supply this year and Nvidia can move its chips around. They maintain a Buy rating on the stock.For the week, Nvidia slipped fractionally to $423.02, while AMD gained 2.4% to $113.91.Micron beats, but investors are still worried about China riskMicron's (NASDAQ:MU) fiscal third-quarter earnings came in better than expected, but concerns remained on its China market share risk.Shares lost 4% on Thursday and continued drifting lower into Friday's close.The chipmaker said the bottom was in for memory-chip revenue, announcing an adjusted loss of $1.43 a share on revenue of $3.75 billion. Analysts polled by Investing.com anticipated a loss of $1.59 a share on revenue of $3.67B.Still, the chipmaker warned that China's recent Cyberspace Administration of China decision was a ""significant headwind"" impacting its outlook and slowing its recovery.Story continuesWall Street analysts nonetheless mostly reflected positively on Micron's results and outlook. Citi said while the results were ""ugly,"" which was expected, many signs are pointing at recovery being on the way.""We continue to believe the worst of the memory cycle is behind us and a recovery is in sight,"" they said in a note.And Piper Sandler analysts raised the rating to Neutral with a price target of $70 per share ""primarily based on improving end-market inventory conditions with a potential improvement in volumes and pricing in 2H23.""Multiple analysts cut Tesla to neutralAfter Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares' blistering run last month, the stock has been hit with a series of valuation-based downgrades over the past couple weeks, including cuts to neutral-equivalent ratings at Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Barclays.Since its bottom in late April, Tesla stock has rallied some 70% vs. an 8% rise for the S&amp;P 500.Goldman cut the shares to Neutral from buy, although analysts there still raised the price target to $248 per share from the prior $185, reflecting increased EPS estimates and a higher target multiple. It elaborated:Overall we believe our view that Tesla is well positioned for long-term growth, given its leading position in the EV and clean energy markets (which we attribute in part to its ability to offer full solutions including charging, storage, software/FSD and services with a direct sales model), is now better reflected in the stock.While the downgrade move was mostly driven by valuation, Goldman also highlighted a “difficult pricing environment for new vehicles,” which it believes will hurt Tesla’s non-GAAP gross margin in 2023.Overall, Goldman remains “positive on EV adoption, and we continue to see the most investing opportunities among our broader set of suppliers, especially those with higher content to enable the shift to EVs and electrification.”Barclays, for its part, downgraded the shares to Equal Weight from Overweight, saying it believes the recent sharp run-up in shares is ignoring questions on near-term fundamentals.While Tesla stock movements tend to be driven by more than fundamentals sometimes, Barclays analysts say they are cautious to jump on the bandwagon. They believe the rally is mostly driven by investors’ renewed love for tech stocks, as well as by the excitement over recent announcements that Tesla will open its Supercharger network to other brands:The relative disregard of challenges to near-term TSLA fundamentals amid the sharp rally is our key concern on the stock, and at the core of our downgrade to an EW rating. We see a number of underlying weak points in the near-term TSLA narrative.It added, though, that it remains bullish in the longer term:To be clear, we see significant long-term opportunity for TSLA - a view which underpinned our prior Overweight rating.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the topic, head directly to 5 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees. Using cannabis can affect attention, memory, and learning, same as alcohol. It is understandable that employers prefer workers to be lucid during work, be it drugs or alcohol. However, workplace drug testing can only detect recent cannabis or drug use, and it does not necessarily determine potential safety problems in the future. Other substances like opioids, antidepressants, and medically prescribed marijuana can also cause impairment. If an employee offers a valid prescription, the employer has to legally accept their use of these medications. Similarly, with recreational drugs, unless employees come to work visibly stoned or with their mental faculties impaired, should it really matter to employers what they do on their own time? CBD products that don’t cause a high in users may also contain elements that trigger a positive response on a drug screening test. While many states approve of pre-employment drug testing, some instruct employers to inform applicants beforehand. An SHRM report highlighted that courts have decreed that pre-employment drug testing is not the same as medical examinations as per the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission demands that these drug tests be carried out after employees receive a conditional job acceptance. This is because the employer may need to make further medical inquiries to applicants based on the test results. Employers should also take into consideration local regulations. For example, conducting random drug tests is prohibited unless mandated by federal law in San Francisco. In California, the state constitution allows individuals the right to privacy, which means drug screenings without proper basis, such as random tests, are permitted in very exceptional circumstances. Similarly, employers must submit a written request to the labor commissioner in Connecticut, stating the reasons for performing random drug screenings, and get approval for the process.Story continuesDon't Miss: 15 States With the Biggest Drug Problems in 2023Moreover, the legalization of adult-use cannabis across a majority of states is also disrupting the “Just Say No” era when it comes to employment. One significant factor behind the decision to relax drug testing policies is the lack of young blood in the aging workforce. This extends to the federal government and military as well. Per a New York Times report, the US military has allowed 3,400 candidates who failed to meet the drug screening criteria to try for recruitment again over the last five years. Similarly, the FBI and CIA are also relaxing their drug policies and allowing the use of marijuana among job applicants. Moreover, the Biden Administration is aiming to be more lenient when it comes to security clearances, given that over half of the American population has indulged in recreational or medicinal cannabis, and most believe that it should be completely legal. According to Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin: “We don’t want to be disqualifying half of the population, tens of millions of people, for having done something that most of our recent presidents have done. You’re taking huge numbers of people off the field.”Similarly, multiple changes have been made to drug testing policies by government agencies. The CIA, beginning from April 2022, reduced the marijuana abstinence period for new candidates to just 90 days, down from one year. The FBI also lowered its marijuana abstention requirement for potential candidates from three years to one year in 2021. In December 2021, Avril D. Haines, the Director of National Intelligence, announced that past recreational marijuana use should be considered ""relevant"" but not the sole factor in determining an individual's suitability for sensitive national security positions.In this article, we discuss 25 big companies that don’t drug test employees. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Our Methodology For this article, we selected the most prominent firms whose websites don’t explicitly state the need for pre-employment drug screening or random drug testing for employees. For companies whose websites were unclear, we researched on LinkedIn, Indeed, Reddit, and Zippia, and relied on majority consensus to shortlist firms that don’t drug test employees. It is important to note that most companies reserve the right to perform drug tests on employees who are involved in workplace accidents which could normally be prevented, or individuals who show up to work with their mental faculties very clearly impaired.  25 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test EmployeesCopyright: antonioguillem / 123RF Stock PhotoBig Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees25.

The company reported system-wide same-store sales increased 8.2%, raised estimates for growth in net income, and authorized another large share repurchase. Membership grew to an all-time record, now fully recovered from the pandemic lows. New gym openings are somewhat constrained by availability of HVAC units, but we envision the pace of growth will accelerate and that the base of gyms can still double over time from 2,000 to 4,000. We believe that EBITDA can grow at a mid-teens rate long term on a declining share count and that the trading multiple can modestly expand, which will drive continued good stock performance.”15.

Alphabet’s price-to-earnings multiple continues to contract due to concerns about the potential for revenue to be more economically sensitive than it has been historically, given the vast size of the business today. At Amazon, cost pressures and slowing AWS growth weighed on its share price. The regulatory status of Intercontinental Exchange’s pending acquisition offer for Black Knight remains a concern, while in the interim, business conditions have deteriorated given the slowdown in the mortgage market.

(NYSE:DKS) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. was the first stock Michael recommended to us shortly after he joined Baron Capital in 2003. Dick’s share price has since increased about nine-fold. Unfortunately, we sold our investment in Dick’s about six years ago and, although it was a successful investment, we did not realize the full benefit of Michael’s recommendation. We sold too soon because I was concerned that competition from internet retailers would have a permanent negative impact on Dick’s stores’ profitability. I was wrong. Dick’s stock price so far has about doubled after we sold…and its prospects have brightened!We sold even though we considered Ed Stack, Dick’s Chairm”n and CEO, a terrific retailer, a great entrepreneur and a special person. Ed had built Dick’s from three bait and tackle stores his dad started into a uniquely positioned, nationwide chain of 730 sporting goods stores. In fact, Dick’s is now the largest nationwide sporting goods chain. Ed had purchased the three bait and tackle stores, the foundation of Dick’s business, from his dad. Ed’s mother loaned him the money to buy his dad’s stores! I’m not exactly sure what that signifies. But it may have something to do with Carl Icahn’s proclamation that “everything I have is for sale except my children…and maybe my wife.”Ed and his newly appointed CEO Lauren Hobart visited us last month. Ed asked for the meeting to introduce us to Lauren, as well as to discuss the prospects for Dick’s new, large format stores with attached outdoor, student athletic fields. Lauren then described how well its new format stores were doing in two smaller communities. We also spoke about the successes of Dick’s omni-channel retailing efforts and how desirable Dick’s stores have become to shopping centers trying to lure shoppers to return to their malls.”13.

(NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”12.

Same store sales were positive with better-than-expected margins resulting in earnings for the quarter ahead of expectations. At the same time, Target provided guidance for 2023 that was below expectations, which sets them up to meet or exceed expectations after a difficult 2022. Target expects same store sales for 2023 to range from a low single digit decline to a low single digit increase, with operating margins in the 4.5% to 5% range. We continue to view Target as well positioned for long-term growth with its strong owned brand strategy and omnichannel offerings.”11. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc.

Despite needing to raise prices by double digit rates to offset inflation in food prices and higher labor costs, the company has seen resilient customer demand. While digital orders have fallen from peak COVID levels, digital sales stabilized in the fourth quarter at approximately 40% of all orders or twice the volume seen pre-COVID. The company has remained busy opening new locations with a focus on those that can support a Chipotlane, the company’s drive through concept that leverages customers’ ability to order ahead on their phones to make pick up times very short.

Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”9.

While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses.

But it's been a pretty ho-hum year for the rest of the index, which has been dominated by some big-name laggards.""Part of it, in our view, is the average stocks better reflect some of the broader macroeconomic uncertainty and significant increase in the Fed funds rates over the past year,"" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner tells Yahoo Finance.Powered mostly by hype around new generative AI technology, seven stocks have fueled most of the S&amp;P 500's 15% year-to-date advance, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.Another view from Goldman Sachs (chart below): 15 of the biggest companies have driven 86% of the S&amp;P 500's return year-to-date.Nvidia (AI hype) and Meta (cost-cutting and AI hype) have led the charge for the S&amp;P 500 with respective gains of 180% and 133%. Tesla shares are up 109% (AI hype and strong EV demand).Apple is up 46% on optimism around some pricey new VR goggles. Amazon is oddly up 52% despite not announcing anything on the AI front and continuing to have poor quarters. And Microsoft and Alphabet have traded blows on AI developments, in the process driving respective stock price gains of 39% and 34%.""These stocks have benefited from coming into the year in an oversold position, the excitement around AI, and earnings revision trends that have turned higher,"" Lerner says. ""Also, even if the economy slows as we expect, it’s likely that companies will continue to spend on tech, or fear of being left behind. That should be good for tech earnings on a relative basis.""But non-tech companies haven't fared quite as well. CVS Health is down 26%, Moderna is off 34% and VF Corp is down 31%.Will the rest of the S&amp;P 500 finally draw more interest from investors in the second half of the year? Pros like Lerner and BMO's Brian Belski expect a modest broadening out of the market's rally as investors seek out bargains and bet on no rate hikes in 2024.Story continues""The bogeyman of narrow market breadth has started to broaden out and is a trend we expect will continue,"" says Belski.Here are three relative laggards from the S&amp;P 500 this year that could gain favor on the Street.BUY #1: AT&amp;TYear to Date Performance: -13%AT&amp;T (T) has had a challenging first half of the year as declining subscriber growth, softer-than-expected sales and disappointing free cash flow levels kept investors away from the telecom giant.But despite those headwinds, David Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar, told Yahoo Finance that AT&amp;T is a top pick.""AT&amp;T is at the intersection of being a deep value play,"" Sekera said. ""Fundamentally, it’s in a relatively strong position. We rate the company with a narrow economic moat, which means it has long-term structural cost advantages.""Added positive: AT&amp;T's CFO Pascal Desroches told Yahoo Finance Live that key parts of the business have begun to turn the corner.BUY #2: OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUMYear to Date Performance: -8%Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the Houston-based oil company backed by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, has surprisingly been left in the dust.Shares are off more than 8% year to date amid lingering worries of softening oil demand against a backdrop of sluggish global economic growth. And the oil producer is not alone. The S&amp;P 500's Energy Select Sector (XLE) is down 10% year to date following the sector's massive 57.6% gain last year.Occidental’s largest shareholder, Buffett has protected the stock from the worst of this year's energy sector sell-off. He boosted his stake in the company to above 25% after buying 2.1 million more shares worth about $123 million.So, as Warren Buffett doubles down on Occidental, Portfolio Wealth Advisors CEO Lee Munson sees an opportunity to bet on the ‘beaten up’ stock too.""Back in 2019 they bought Anadarko – which means they own half the Permian Basin,"" Munson told Yahoo Finance Live. ""The Permian is the crown jewel. It’s cheap to extract, and once you pump it all out you can frack it to draw blood from a stone – printing money… I love that they have cheap production.""BUY #3: CISCOYear to Date Performance: +7%A challenging macroeconomic environment has left Cisco (CSCO) shares far behind its tech peers and the broader S&amp;P 500.The stock's 7% gain so far this year pales in comparison to the Nasdaq 100 Index’s (^NDX) 36% surge.

100,505b46d5-8094-3880-beaa-9d0d4b4cea5f,OXY,2023-07-03,A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY),Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/look-intrinsic-value-occidental-petroleum-140015232.html,1688306415,STORY,['OXY'],"[Key InsightsUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Occidental Petroleum fair value estimate is US$67.52Occidental Petroleum's US$58.80 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate The US$68.00 analyst price target for OXYis comparable to our estimate of fair value.In this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY) by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. Anyone interested in learning a bit more about intrinsic value should have a read of the Simply Wall St analysis model. See our latest analysis for Occidental Petroleum Is Occidental Petroleum Fairly Valued?We're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast2024202520262027202820292030203120322033 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$6.22bUS$5.09bUS$5.37bUS$5.33bUS$5.33bUS$5.37bUS$5.43bUS$5.51bUS$5.60bUS$5.70bGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x8Analyst x5Analyst x3Analyst x3Est @ 0.13%Est @ 0.72%Est @ 1.14%Est @ 1.43%Est @ 1.63%Est @ 1.78% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$5.6kUS$4.2kUS$4.0kUS$3.6kUS$3.3kUS$3.0kUS$2.7kUS$2.5kUS$2.3kUS$2.1k(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$33bStory continuesAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$5.7b× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$71bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$71b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$27bThe total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$60b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$58.8, the company appears about fair value at a 13% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfThe AssumptionsNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Occidental Petroleum as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.375. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Occidental PetroleumStrengthEarnings growth over the past year exceeded its 5-year average.Debt is well covered by earnings and cashflows.Dividends are covered by earnings and cash flows.WeaknessEarnings growth over the past year underperformed the Oil and Gas industry.Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Oil and Gas market.OpportunityCurrent share price is below our estimate of fair value.ThreatAnnual earnings are forecast to decline for the next 3 years.Moving On:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation.

As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Specifically, we decided to study Textron's  ROE in this article.Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital. See our latest analysis for Textron How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Textron is:12% = US$860m ÷ US$7.0b (Based on the trailing twelve months to April 2023).The 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.12 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.Textron's Earnings Growth And 12% ROETo start with, Textron's ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE is similar to the industry average of 12%. Despite this, Textron's five year net income growth was quite flat over the past five years. So, there could be some other aspects that could potentially be preventing the company from growing. For example, it could be that the company has a high payout ratio or the business has allocated capital poorly, for instance.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that the industry grew its earnings by 5.7% over the last few years.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. What is TXT worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether TXT is currently mispriced by the market.Is Textron Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?Textron's low three-year median payout ratio of 2.4% (implying that the company keeps98% of its income) should mean that the company is retaining most of its earnings to fuel its growth and this should be reflected in its growth number, but that's not the case.Additionally, Textron has paid dividends over a period of at least ten years, which means that the company's management is determined to pay dividends even if it means little to no earnings growth. Existing analyst estimates suggest that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 1.4% over the next three years. The fact that the company's ROE is expected to rise to 15% over the same period is explained by the drop in the payout ratio.ConclusionOverall, we feel that Textron certainly does have some positive factors to consider. Although, we are disappointed to see a lack of growth in earnings even in spite of a high ROE and and a high reinvestment rate. We believe that there might be some outside factors that could be having a negative impact on the business. That being so, the latest industry analyst forecasts show that the analysts are expecting to see a huge improvement in the company's earnings growth rate.

And the truth is, you can make significant gains if you buy good quality businesses at the right price. For example, long term UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (NYSE:UNH) shareholders have enjoyed a 89% share price rise over the last half decade, well in excess of the market return of around 52% (not including dividends).Let's take a look at the underlying fundamentals over the longer term, and see if they've been consistent with shareholders returns. See our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group To quote Buffett, 'Ships will sail around the world but the Flat Earth Society will flourish. There will continue to be wide discrepancies between price and value in the marketplace...' One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.During five years of share price growth, UnitedHealth Group achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 14% per year. This EPS growth is remarkably close to the 14% average annual increase in the share price. Therefore one could conclude that sentiment towards the shares hasn't morphed very much. Rather, the share price has approximately tracked EPS growth.You can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values).earnings-per-share-growthWe know that UnitedHealth Group has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? You could check out this free report showing analyst revenue forecasts.What About Dividends?When looking at investment returns, it is important to consider the difference between total shareholder return (TSR) and share price return. Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. As it happens, UnitedHealth Group's TSR for the last 5 years was 104%, which exceeds the share price return mentioned earlier. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveUnitedHealth Group shareholders are down 5.8% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 16%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. On the bright side, long term shareholders have made money, with a gain of 15% per year over half a decade. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Even so, be aware that  UnitedHealth Group is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about...Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere.

When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We can see that The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. (NYSE:EL) does use debt in its business. But the real question is whether this debt is making the company risky.When Is Debt A Problem?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Estée Lauder Companies What Is Estée Lauder Companies's Net Debt?The image below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that at March 2023 Estée Lauder Companies had debt of US$7.51b, up from US$5.53b in one year. However, because it has a cash reserve of US$5.53b, its net debt is less, at about US$1.98b.debt-equity-history-analysisA Look At Estée Lauder Companies' LiabilitiesZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Estée Lauder Companies had liabilities of US$7.70b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$8.32b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$5.53b in cash and US$1.90b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$8.58b.Of course, Estée Lauder Companies has a titanic market capitalization of US$70.2b, so these liabilities are probably manageable. However, we do think it is worth keeping an eye on its balance sheet strength, as it may change over time.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).Estée Lauder Companies has a low net debt to EBITDA ratio of only 0.74. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 17.9 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. It is just as well that Estée Lauder Companies's load is not too heavy, because its EBIT was down 47% over the last year. Falling earnings (if the trend continues) could eventually make even modest debt quite risky. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Estée Lauder Companies's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts.Finally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. So we clearly need to look at whether that EBIT is leading to corresponding free cash flow. Over the most recent three years, Estée Lauder Companies recorded free cash flow worth 68% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This cold hard cash means it can reduce its debt when it wants to.Our ViewEstée Lauder Companies's EBIT growth rate was a real negative on this analysis, although the other factors we considered were considerably better. There's no doubt that its ability to to cover its interest expense with its EBIT is pretty flash. Considering this range of data points, we think Estée Lauder Companies is in a good position to manage its debt levels. Having said that, the load is sufficiently heavy that we would recommend any shareholders keep a close eye on it. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it.

107,2adf0100-05d2-3757-986f-1035bd546de5,EL,2023-07-03,The 3 Best Beauty Stocks to Buy for the Back-to-Office Boom,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-best-beauty-stocks-buy-205637568.html,1687812997,STORY,"['ULTA', 'EL']","[While the concept of best beauty stocks might not arouse any particularly strong emotion, the basis for the current bullish thesis might. Yes, I’m talking about the dreaded return to the office. Peruse public forums and various social media channels and you’ll be inundated with self-proclaimed stories about increased productivity. Certainly, remote workers are not sleeping on the job and working two (or more) full-time jobs simultaneously.Unfortunately, despite no remote workers taking advantage of their employers, companies are skeptical. It might have something to do with a July 2015 Forbes article describing employees wasting time as an “epidemic.” Or an April 2019 post by the American Management Association that revealed the average worker wastes more than two hours a day on the clock. Whatever the case, beauty stocks for the back-to-office trend should blossom.Look, I know that all my fellow Americans are 100% trustworthy and will never buy mouse jigglers to pretend that they’re working. It’s absurd because remote workers are so productive that they don’t have time to pretend to work. Sadly, these mouse jigglers are stupid, irrelevant products that never made any money.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsStill, the boss wants you in the office, boding well for these top beauty stocks to buy.Ulta Beauty (ULTA)Orange Ulta Beauty (ULTA) logo on storefrontSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comBased in Bolingbrook, Illinois, Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) is the largest U.S. beauty retailer, according to its corporate profile. The company represents the premier beauty destination for cosmetics, fragrances, skincare products, hair care products, and salon services. So far this year, the print hasn’t looked great, with ULTA slipping nearly 4%. Still, it could rank among the best beauty stocks for the back-to-office trend.According to a Dec. 2020 op-ed by The Washington Post, the Covid-19 year became America’s pajama moment. Rather than going through the traditional ritual of preparing for a full day at the office, folks can just do their work in their sweatsuit. While that might have been the norm during the Covid days, the return to the office should make ULTA one of the top beauty stocks to buy.Story continuesFinancially, Ulta arguably benefits the most from its sold operational stats, particularly its revenue and EBITDA growth trends. Also, it’s consistently profitable, featuring a trailing-year net margin of 12%, beating out nearly 90% of the competition. Finally, analysts peg ULTA as a moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $541.29, implying over 19% upside potential.Estee Lauder (EL)An Estee Lauder retail store at Elements Shopping Mall in Hong Kong.Source: Sorbis / Shutterstock.comBy performance stats, Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) might not seem a compelling argument for the best beauty stocks. Sure, the company represents one of the world’s leading manufacturers and marketers of quality skincare, makeup, fragrance, and hair care products. However, the market doesn’t seem to care at the moment. Since the Jan. opener, EL staggered to a loss of more than 24%.Nevertheless, if you want to invest in beauty stocks based on the return-to-office pivot, EL could be very intriguing. Almost surely, an increasing number of companies will be raising the alarm about alleged productivity gains. Early this year, a story out of Canada revealed that an accountant lied about how many hours she worked while remote.Lack of accountability tempts people to cheat? I am shocked, I tell you, shocked.Now, EL may be a little bit pricey based on commonly gauged metrics. However, it’s a consistently profitable enterprise. Combined with the likely pivot back to the office, EL should be one of the best beauty industry stocks. Lastly, analysts love it, pegging EL as a moderate buy with an average price target of $238.12. That’s 24% higher than the time-of-writing price.Beauty Health (SKIN)An image of a street sign post with directions labeled ""Buy"", ""Hold"", and ""Sell""Source: PX Media / ShutterstockFundamentally the riskiest idea on this list of best beauty stocks for the back-to-office trend due to lesser brand recognition, Beauty Health (NASDAQ:SKIN) nevertheless deserves consideration among contrarian investors. Specializing in the manufacturing and selling of serum-based hydra dermabrasion systems and aesthetic products, Beauty Health could take a significant leadership role in a burgeoning market segment.As well, everybody else that’s ignoring SKIN – and that’s a lot of folks considering how shares lost almost 16% of value since the Jan. opener – doesn’t appreciate the return-to-office pivot. In Feb. of this year, a New York legal firm sued one of its attorneys. It’s a familiar story by now, with the firm accusing the employee of using remote work to “quiet quit” while she devoted herself to a new venture.It’s almost as if employers don’t quite trust self-proclaimed productivity assertions because of personal biases. That’s so weird because everybody is trustworthy. I don’t even know why we have highway patrol officers because everybody obeys the speed limit. Anyways, Beauty Health is all about growth and not so much about profitability (for now). However, analysts do peg SKIN as a moderate buy. Also, their average price target stands at $18.83, implying over 142% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

(NYSE:AMP) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. When analyzing insider transactions, it is usually more valuable to know whether insiders are buying versus knowing if they are selling, as the latter sends an ambiguous message. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether. Check out our latest analysis for Ameriprise Financial Ameriprise Financial Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Chairman &amp; CEO, James Cracchiolo, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$14m worth of shares at a price of US$353 each. So what is clear is that an insider saw fit to sell at around the current price of US$332. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. We note that this sale took place at around the current price, so it isn't a major concern, though it's hardly a good sign.Ameriprise Financial insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year.

I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Ameriprise Financial insiders own 0.3% of the company, currently worth about US$110m based on the recent share price. Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Ameriprise Financial Tell Us?There haven't been any insider transactions in the last three months -- that doesn't mean much. It's great to see high levels of insider ownership, but looking back over the last year, we don't gain confidence from the Ameriprise Financial insiders selling. In addition to knowing about insider transactions going on, it's beneficial to identify the risks facing Ameriprise Financial.

If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the topic, head directly to 5 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees. Using cannabis can affect attention, memory, and learning, same as alcohol. It is understandable that employers prefer workers to be lucid during work, be it drugs or alcohol. However, workplace drug testing can only detect recent cannabis or drug use, and it does not necessarily determine potential safety problems in the future. Other substances like opioids, antidepressants, and medically prescribed marijuana can also cause impairment. If an employee offers a valid prescription, the employer has to legally accept their use of these medications. Similarly, with recreational drugs, unless employees come to work visibly stoned or with their mental faculties impaired, should it really matter to employers what they do on their own time? CBD products that don’t cause a high in users may also contain elements that trigger a positive response on a drug screening test. While many states approve of pre-employment drug testing, some instruct employers to inform applicants beforehand. An SHRM report highlighted that courts have decreed that pre-employment drug testing is not the same as medical examinations as per the Americans with Disabilities Act. However, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission demands that these drug tests be carried out after employees receive a conditional job acceptance. This is because the employer may need to make further medical inquiries to applicants based on the test results. Employers should also take into consideration local regulations. For example, conducting random drug tests is prohibited unless mandated by federal law in San Francisco. In California, the state constitution allows individuals the right to privacy, which means drug screenings without proper basis, such as random tests, are permitted in very exceptional circumstances. Similarly, employers must submit a written request to the labor commissioner in Connecticut, stating the reasons for performing random drug screenings, and get approval for the process.Story continuesDon't Miss: 15 States With the Biggest Drug Problems in 2023Moreover, the legalization of adult-use cannabis across a majority of states is also disrupting the “Just Say No” era when it comes to employment. One significant factor behind the decision to relax drug testing policies is the lack of young blood in the aging workforce. This extends to the federal government and military as well. Per a New York Times report, the US military has allowed 3,400 candidates who failed to meet the drug screening criteria to try for recruitment again over the last five years. Similarly, the FBI and CIA are also relaxing their drug policies and allowing the use of marijuana among job applicants. Moreover, the Biden Administration is aiming to be more lenient when it comes to security clearances, given that over half of the American population has indulged in recreational or medicinal cannabis, and most believe that it should be completely legal. According to Maryland Democrat Jamie Raskin: “We don’t want to be disqualifying half of the population, tens of millions of people, for having done something that most of our recent presidents have done. You’re taking huge numbers of people off the field.”Similarly, multiple changes have been made to drug testing policies by government agencies. The CIA, beginning from April 2022, reduced the marijuana abstinence period for new candidates to just 90 days, down from one year. The FBI also lowered its marijuana abstention requirement for potential candidates from three years to one year in 2021. In December 2021, Avril D. Haines, the Director of National Intelligence, announced that past recreational marijuana use should be considered ""relevant"" but not the sole factor in determining an individual's suitability for sensitive national security positions.In this article, we discuss 25 big companies that don’t drug test employees. These include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Our Methodology For this article, we selected the most prominent firms whose websites don’t explicitly state the need for pre-employment drug screening or random drug testing for employees. For companies whose websites were unclear, we researched on LinkedIn, Indeed, Reddit, and Zippia, and relied on majority consensus to shortlist firms that don’t drug test employees. It is important to note that most companies reserve the right to perform drug tests on employees who are involved in workplace accidents which could normally be prevented, or individuals who show up to work with their mental faculties very clearly impaired.  25 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test EmployeesCopyright: antonioguillem / 123RF Stock PhotoBig Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees25. TwitterTwitter, an American social media company, is against drug testing for its employees. This especially became a norm during COVID-19, when remote work was encouraged. Twitter also implemented a remote work structure after the pandemic restrictions were lifted, which meant that drug testing was not necessary at all for employees. However, ever since Elon Musk took over the company on October 27, 2022, the future of the company and its policies – including drug testing – remain uncertain. In addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Netflix, Inc.

Strong investor sentiment for consumer staples helped bolster Sprouts’s stock price to a level we believe reflected the fair value of the company, and we exited the position to capture the positive returns on the stock.”17. The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 25The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) is an American apparel retailer that sells its clothes, accessories, and personal care products under the Old Navy, Gap, Banana Republic, and Athleta brands. The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) is one of the biggest companies that believe in equal opportunity employment and therefore does not drug test its employees. On May 25, The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS) reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $0.01, outperforming Wall Street consensus by $0.17. The revenue of $3.28 billion was in-line with market estimates. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 25 hedge funds were bullish on The Gap, Inc. (NYSE:GPS), compared to 28 funds in the earlier quarter. Richard S. Pzena’s Pzena Investment Management is the largest position holder in the company. 16. Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 35Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT) was founded in 1992 and is headquartered in Hampton, New Hampshire. The company owns, manages, and franchises fitness centers under the Planet Fitness brand. It is one of the top companies that do not believe in employee drug testing. Planet Fitness, Inc.

(NYSE:PLNT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Shares of Planet Fitness, Inc. (NYSE:PLNT), the leading franchiser and operator of low-cost fitness centers, rose after reporting strong results. The company reported system-wide same-store sales increased 8.2%, raised estimates for growth in net income, and authorized another large share repurchase. Membership grew to an all-time record, now fully recovered from the pandemic lows. New gym openings are somewhat constrained by availability of HVAC units, but we envision the pace of growth will accelerate and that the base of gyms can still double over time from 2,000 to 4,000. We believe that EBITDA can grow at a mid-teens rate long term on a declining share count and that the trading multiple can modestly expand, which will drive continued good stock performance.”15. Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 38Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) operates discount retail stores throughout the United States and Canada. Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) does not engage in employee drug tests. On May 25, the company reported a Q1 non-GAAP EPS of $1.47, missing Wall Street estimates by $0.07.

Paul Hilal’s Mantle Ridge LP is the largest position holder in the company, with 11.3 million shares worth $1.6 billion. Madison Funds made the following comment about Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR) in its fourth-quarter 2022 investor letter:“Our largest individual detractors were Brookfield Corporation, Alphabet, Amazon, Black Knight, and Dollar Tree, Inc. (NASDAQ:DLTR). Alphabet’s price-to-earnings multiple continues to contract due to concerns about the potential for revenue to be more economically sensitive than it has been historically, given the vast size of the business today. At Amazon, cost pressures and slowing AWS growth weighed on its share price. The regulatory status of Intercontinental Exchange’s pending acquisition offer for Black Knight remains a concern, while in the interim, business conditions have deteriorated given the slowdown in the mortgage market. Lastly, Dollar Tree’s margin outlook disappointed as management is investing to drive traffic to their stores and improve Family Dollar operations.”14. DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE:DKS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43DICK'S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE:DKS) operates as a sporting goods retailer in the United States.

(NYSE:DKS), compared to 40 funds in the prior quarter. Stephen Mandel’s Lone Pine Capital is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $647.8 million. Here is what Baron Fund has to say about DICK’S Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE:DKS) in its Q1 2022 investor letter:“Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. was the first stock Michael recommended to us shortly after he joined Baron Capital in 2003. Dick’s share price has since increased about nine-fold. Unfortunately, we sold our investment in Dick’s about six years ago and, although it was a successful investment, we did not realize the full benefit of Michael’s recommendation. We sold too soon because I was concerned that competition from internet retailers would have a permanent negative impact on Dick’s stores’ profitability. I was wrong. Dick’s stock price so far has about doubled after we sold…and its prospects have brightened!We sold even though we considered Ed Stack, Dick’s Chairm”n and CEO, a terrific retailer, a great entrepreneur and a special person. Ed had built Dick’s from three bait and tackle stores his dad started into a uniquely positioned, nationwide chain of 730 sporting goods stores. In fact, Dick’s is now the largest nationwide sporting goods chain. Ed had purchased the three bait and tackle stores, the foundation of Dick’s business, from his dad. Ed’s mother loaned him the money to buy his dad’s stores! I’m not exactly sure what that signifies. But it may have something to do with Carl Icahn’s proclamation that “everything I have is for sale except my children…and maybe my wife.”Ed and his newly appointed CEO Lauren Hobart visited us last month. Ed asked for the meeting to introduce us to Lauren, as well as to discuss the prospects for Dick’s new, large format stores with attached outdoor, student athletic fields. Lauren then described how well its new format stores were doing in two smaller communities. We also spoke about the successes of Dick’s omni-channel retailing efforts and how desirable Dick’s stores have become to shopping centers trying to lure shoppers to return to their malls.”13. The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 43The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) is a food and drug retailer in the United States. It is one of the big companies that don’t drug test employees. On June 22, The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) declared a $0.29 per share quarterly dividend, an 11.5% increase from its prior dividend of $0.26. The dividend is payable on September 1, to shareholders of record on August 15. According to Insider Monkey’s first quarter database, 43 hedge funds were bullish on The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR), compared to 42 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 50 million shares worth $2.46 billion. Oakmark Fund made the following comment about The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons has the potential to drive accelerated earnings growth and further scale advantages.

Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies.

While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses. In short, we think there are better risk-reward opportunities.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees.  Suggested articles:Top 20 Countries With Highest Drug Consumption20 Most Commonly Used Recreational Drugs in America15 Most Profitable Drugs In The World Disclosure: None. 25 Big Companies That Don't Drug Test Employees is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

But it's been a pretty ho-hum year for the rest of the index, which has been dominated by some big-name laggards.""Part of it, in our view, is the average stocks better reflect some of the broader macroeconomic uncertainty and significant increase in the Fed funds rates over the past year,"" Truist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner tells Yahoo Finance.Powered mostly by hype around new generative AI technology, seven stocks have fueled most of the S&amp;P 500's 15% year-to-date advance, according to data from Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&amp;P Dow Jones Indices.Another view from Goldman Sachs (chart below): 15 of the biggest companies have driven 86% of the S&amp;P 500's return year-to-date.Nvidia (AI hype) and Meta (cost-cutting and AI hype) have led the charge for the S&amp;P 500 with respective gains of 180% and 133%. Tesla shares are up 109% (AI hype and strong EV demand).Apple is up 46% on optimism around some pricey new VR goggles. Amazon is oddly up 52% despite not announcing anything on the AI front and continuing to have poor quarters. And Microsoft and Alphabet have traded blows on AI developments, in the process driving respective stock price gains of 39% and 34%.""These stocks have benefited from coming into the year in an oversold position, the excitement around AI, and earnings revision trends that have turned higher,"" Lerner says. ""Also, even if the economy slows as we expect, it’s likely that companies will continue to spend on tech, or fear of being left behind. That should be good for tech earnings on a relative basis.""But non-tech companies haven't fared quite as well. CVS Health is down 26%, Moderna is off 34% and VF Corp is down 31%.Will the rest of the S&amp;P 500 finally draw more interest from investors in the second half of the year? Pros like Lerner and BMO's Brian Belski expect a modest broadening out of the market's rally as investors seek out bargains and bet on no rate hikes in 2024.Story continues""The bogeyman of narrow market breadth has started to broaden out and is a trend we expect will continue,"" says Belski.Here are three relative laggards from the S&amp;P 500 this year that could gain favor on the Street.BUY #1: AT&amp;TYear to Date Performance: -13%AT&amp;T (T) has had a challenging first half of the year as declining subscriber growth, softer-than-expected sales and disappointing free cash flow levels kept investors away from the telecom giant.But despite those headwinds, David Sekera, chief US market strategist at Morningstar, told Yahoo Finance that AT&amp;T is a top pick.""AT&amp;T is at the intersection of being a deep value play,"" Sekera said. ""Fundamentally, it’s in a relatively strong position. We rate the company with a narrow economic moat, which means it has long-term structural cost advantages.""Added positive: AT&amp;T's CFO Pascal Desroches told Yahoo Finance Live that key parts of the business have begun to turn the corner.BUY #2: OCCIDENTAL PETROLEUMYear to Date Performance: -8%Occidental Petroleum (OXY), the Houston-based oil company backed by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, has surprisingly been left in the dust.Shares are off more than 8% year to date amid lingering worries of softening oil demand against a backdrop of sluggish global economic growth. And the oil producer is not alone. The S&amp;P 500's Energy Select Sector (XLE) is down 10% year to date following the sector's massive 57.6% gain last year.Occidental’s largest shareholder, Buffett has protected the stock from the worst of this year's energy sector sell-off. He boosted his stake in the company to above 25% after buying 2.1 million more shares worth about $123 million.So, as Warren Buffett doubles down on Occidental, Portfolio Wealth Advisors CEO Lee Munson sees an opportunity to bet on the ‘beaten up’ stock too.""Back in 2019 they bought Anadarko – which means they own half the Permian Basin,"" Munson told Yahoo Finance Live. ""The Permian is the crown jewel. It’s cheap to extract, and once you pump it all out you can frack it to draw blood from a stone – printing money… I love that they have cheap production.""BUY #3: CISCOYear to Date Performance: +7%A challenging macroeconomic environment has left Cisco (CSCO) shares far behind its tech peers and the broader S&amp;P 500.The stock's 7% gain so far this year pales in comparison to the Nasdaq 100 Index’s (^NDX) 36% surge. Investors have overlooked the maker of computer networking equipment amid concern clients are cutting back on IT spending. Orders declined 23% in its most recent quarter.New Constructs CEO David Trainer told Yahoo Finance he sees the recent underperformance of Cisco as a buying opportunity, given ""terrific fundamentals with a return on invested capital (ROIC) at 15%.""Trainer added: ""The stock also boasts an attractive valuation that implies just 4% profit growth over the next decade. We think the company will do closer to 9% or 10% growth in profits.""Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor. Follow Sozzi on Twitter @BrianSozzi and on LinkedIn.
