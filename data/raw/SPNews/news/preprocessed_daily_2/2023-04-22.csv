If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Stocks Jim Cramer and Hedge Funds Have in Common.""These Uninformed Sellers, They Make Way For The Well Informed Buyers""On April 20, Jim Cramer weighed in on the recent market volatility we have been experiencing. Cramer has spotted a pattern that the market has been exhibiting recently and noted that while the market opens low, it recovers throughout the day as ""buyers come in and scoop up stocks"". According to Cramer, ""uninformed sellers make way for the well informed buyers"".Cramer attributes the morning weakness of the market to a variety of factors, firstly negative news from Europe. Cramer noted that currently, Europe is not performing well in comparison to the United States since inflation is still running high in the region and that is calling for higher interest rates from the ECB.Another reason that is currently causing market volatility, according to Jim Cramer, is negative macroeconomic speculation. Cramer noted that before the opening bell, economists and strategists speculate negatively about rate hikes from the Fed and this results in the market opening low.Thirdly, Cramer thinks that geopolitical tensions are another major factor contributing to the morning weakness of the markets. Here is what he said:""Hardly a day goes by without a negative story on one of these fronts. Overnight, nothing good is ever gonna happen in China right. Then you gotta pray their government doesn't make any comments about the need to retake Taiwan. You won't hear anything particularly good about Ukraine either, and you certainly can't expect anything good to come out of Washington, especially when it comes to debt ceiling negotiations.""Finally, the Mad Money host talked about ""a negative bias"" that results from analyst downgrades, and results in short sellers making ""stocks look real ugly"". Cramer noted that short sellers engage in aggressive short selling and this causes investors to panic and exit their positions as well. However, short sellers create opportunities for ""people who do their homework"". Cramer noted that intelligent investors allow for ""this big batch of sellers to give them better prices"" and then they buy and take stocks higher.Story continuesTo conclude, Cramer thinks that ""well informed buyers"" can profit in the current market. He simplified the behavior of the market by explaining how we have ""a negative bias every morning emanating from Europe, coupled with a gloomy group of money managers who simply don't believe that bear market has ended"".

Additionally, investors are anticipating that the company’s fixed income products will experience growth in 2023.

(NYSE:UNH), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).7. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of Cramer's ""favorites for all of 2023"".

Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Jim Cramer has mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) multiple times in recent days and has been bullish on the stock. Most recently, Cramer spoke about how sentiment around The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) has been negative, but the company disproved the bears after releasing earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2023. Cramer said ""this may be the worst time to invest. But when a good company can see its stock fall by 30%, when there was nothing really wrong, worst time to invest, but invest"". Shares of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) have gone down by 34%, as of April 20, and the stock is trading at a PE multiple of 14x.On April 17, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) announced earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The company generated a revenue of $5.12 billion, up 9.50% year over year, and reported an EPS of $0.93, ahead of EPS estimates by $0.03. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is one of Jim Cramer's top stock picks that are popular among elite hedge funds.At the close of the fourth quarter of 2022, 74 hedge funds were eager on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) and held collective positions worth $8.1 billion in the company. Of those, GQG Partners was the most prominent shareholder and held a stake worth $1.4 billion.Madison Investments made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We bought shares in The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) as they declined meaningfully in March. Schwab is the premier asset-gathering franchise in the brokerage industry, with particular strength in the advisory market. As one of the top two players in the retail side of the market, it has the scale economies to be a low-cost provider and compete with newcomers intent on industry disruption. In the advisory segment, where it serves independent advisors, it delivers the gold standard in service and product breadth. We believe its moat is wide, and it should grow at a healthy pace for the foreseeable future.As part of its brokerage model, Schwab operates a meaningfully sized bank, where its brokerage clients maintain deposits as part of their cash management. With over $300 billion in deposits and $500 billion in assets, if it were an independent bank, it would be one of the largest in the country. As interest rates have risen, many clients have been moving cash from low-yield bank accounts to higher-yielding alternatives, such as money-market funds. The industry calls this process cash “sorting.” For Schwab, cash sorting began about 18 months ago, and a large part of its recent stock price drop can be attributed to investor concerns that this process may accelerate. The difference for Schwab, compared to all other banks, is that when depositors pull money out, they are mostly just moving it over to other parts of Schwab! Thus, unlike traditional banks, Schwab doesn’t lose assets in the sorting dynamic. In fact, like U.S. Bancorp, Schwab appears to be a net beneficiary from the recent mini-panic in that new asset inflows have picked up as individuals flee to safety.This dynamic does cause some disruption at the bank entity, though, as client cash remains within Schwab’s total but is no longer available as deposits to fund the bank’s securities portfolio. We think Schwab has more than sufficient liquidity to deal with this. The realistic worst-case outcome is that total earnings are moderately suppressed for a period as funding costs go up, and Schwab earns less profit for every dollar invested in deposit alternatives, as compared to what it earns per dollar deposited in the bank. Despite this headwind, we believe that as long as Schwab can grow total investment assets under its umbrella over time, its earning power should also grow.”In addition to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), other stocks that both Jim Cramer and hedge funds have in common include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), UnitedHealth Group Inc.

He said that the crisis is worsening at a rapid pace. He also lauded Greta Thunberg’s recent actions to prevent the expansion of coal mines in Germany. Here are some comments from the environmentalist:“There are a lot of words and there are some meaningful commitments, but we are still failing badly. We need to have a supermajority process instead of unanimity in the COP. We cannot let oil companies, gas companies, and petro-states tell us what is permissible.”In May 2022, GIM launched a $1.7 billion Sustainable Solutions Fund IV, which focuses on investing in high-growth companies that are leaders in sustainability, with a particular focus on those that are driving positive environmental and social impact.

These stakes have a total value of over $3.78 billion. Davis Advisers mentioned Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in its annual 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“If Berkshire represents “growing value” then Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) might be said to represent “undervalued growth.” Founded more than a half century ago, Applied Materials has grown to be the largest supplier of manufacturing tools, services and software to the semiconductor industry. Holding more than 15,000 patents, Applied has become the irreplaceable supplier to the critical global growth industry, semiconductors. Because this company’s earnings can be uneven, short-sighted investors often label this company as “cyclical” and assign it a relatively low valuation.We disagree and, having perused more than 50 years of data, conclude that Applied is unquestionably a growth company trading at a value price. Figure 8 shows the two sustainable drivers of this growth. The green bars indicate that semiconductor manufacturers have grown industry revenue at 7.5% over the last decade, more than three times the growth of the U.S. economy over this same decade. The orange line indicates that the percentage of this revenue that the industry commits to capital spending has gradually risen from roughly 20% to 30%. Putting these two trends together, it should come as no surprise that Applied has grown revenue at a rate of 11%, and operating income at more than 19% over this same time period.In the near term, the impact of the chip industry’s post-pandemic inventory correction, which could reduce equipment demand, may more than offset the benefit of recent supply chain issues that limited Applied Materials’ ability to meet customer demand. Longer term, geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. are driving investment in potentially redundant chip production globally, while at the same time the U.S. and her allies are restricting export of leading edge production tools into China. Even though the near term is frustratingly veiled in uncertainty, the recent shortages and trade restrictions have firmly established that access to chip-production technology is essential to every major industrial economy. Given this, we see more opportunity than risk and estimate that Applied Materials could sell at about 10 times what the company could be earning three-to-five years from now.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Environmental Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Al Gore. Suggested articles:Cathie Wood’s Stock Portfolio: 2023 Stock Picks12 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates10 Eyecare Stocks with Upside PotentialDisclosure.

Clearly, Nucor did much better than STLD, but we’ll get to that in a bit.Before that, let’s take a look at the secular drivers that management of both companies talked about. In the words of Nucor management: “for now, the fundamentals driving nonresidential construction and infrastructure projects appear to be quite healthy. Three pieces of legislation: the Infrastructure Investment Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, and the CHIPS Act, provide a combined $975 billion of funding or tax incentives, which will have a multiplier effect on the actual amount of capital deployed. Taken together, we believe that these three programs have the potential to generate up to 8 million tons of incremental steel demand per year over the balance of this decade. According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, an estimated 5 million tons of steel is needed for every $100 billion in infrastructure spending. On top of that, we expect IRA will drive significant investment in clean energy, adding approximately 2 million tons to 3 million tons of annual steel demand for wind, solar, and transmission projects. There also have been more than 30 announced semiconductor plants or expansions in response to the CHIPS Act. These are massive steel-intensive factories that take billions of dollars and years to build.”STLD management agreed that ”continued onshoring of manufacturing, coupled with the robust U.S. infrastructure program and industrial build-outs, supports strong demand for 2023 and beyond.” Additionally, the auto market is also strong for STLD.As a result, Steel Dynamics, has its construction backlog swelling and extending into the fourth quarter. Record steel volume and increased metals recycling prices (due to increased demand in the domestic market) are driving its results.Story continuesNucor, which has sizable exposure to the non-residential construction space, said that both infrastructure and manufacturing investment were driving results. The company’s steel mill utilization rate increased 10% from the December quarter to touch 80%. Management is optimistic about the long-term outlook and feels confident that its flexible operating model and variable cost structure will ensure continued profitability. Its significant domestic production capabilities and low-carbon footprint set it apart from other players.Neither dwelt on macro concerns, other than to say that they would get through them smoothly. Steel Dynamics is however seeing some supply chain, labor and construction materials constraints that led to some orders getting pushed out. Nucor has a track record of operating profitably through downturns and emerging from them even stronger. The long-term investments in its conservative capital structures are designed to withstand all economic cycles, and this time is no different, management says.Given the solid outlook for the industry and the strong showing by these companies, this may be a good time to buy some other steel stocks before they report.ArcelorMittal MT for instance has a Zacks Rank #1 and earnings Expected Surprise Prediction (ESP) of 0.0%, which indicates that it too will beat estimates when it reports on May 4. Its estimates have already risen substantially in the last 30 days.Olympic Steel ZEUS, which shares the same rank as the others and ESP of 0.0% also looks headed in the same direction. It too reports on May 4.Zacks #1 ranked Ryerson RYI reports on May 1 but we don’t have an ESP indicator for this stock.Another stock worth buying is Zacks #1 ranked U.S. Steel X, which reports April 27. There is notable increase in its estimates in the last seven days.Year-to-Date Price PerformanceZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of value and dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Undervalued Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. Undervalued stocks trade at a price lower than their intrinsic or true value. These stocks can potentially be a good investment option for investors who are looking to purchase stocks at a discount and hold them for the long term. If an investor can identify a stock that is undervalued due to temporary factors, such as a downturn in the industry or a negative news event, they may be able to purchase the stock at a lower price and benefit from the potential upside when the temporary factors subside.Growth stocks have outperformed value equities in the past as they offer the potential for higher returns and capital appreciation. However, the consistent changes in monetary policies and growing inflation have turned investors’ attention toward value stocks. According to a report by UBS, value stocks surpassed growth equities by 18 percentage points in the first 10 months of 2022. The report mentioned that inflation above 3% has generally fared well for value stocks historically. In addition to this, tight monetary policies also favor value stocks relative to their growth counterparts. The UBS report revealed that value has historically outperformed growth by an average of 4 percentage points, in the 12 months following the bank’s last rate hike in a cycle.Readers can also have a look at 11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy to know more about value investing.Investors consider value stocks because of their solid long-term returns. This has been proven over the years as value has delivered strong returns to shareholders when compared with growth stocks. Since 1926, value investing returned 1,344,600%, compared with a 626,000% return for growth stocks, as reported by Bank of America. However, growth stocks reasserted their dominance in the recent past when interest rates were low. Investors are often advised to maintain a diversified portfolio, with both value and growth stocks, as it can help them manage risk and achieve their investment goals over the long term.Story continuesIn addition to value stocks, dividend stocks are also becoming popular among investors this year. The Coca-Cola Company (NYSE:KO), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) are some of the best dividend stocks as they have decades-long dividend growth streaks.11 Best Undervalued Dividend Stocks to Buy NowImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from PixabayOur Methodology:For this list, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of the fourth quarter of 2022 and selected at least 25 stocks that have raised their dividends for at least 10 years and have P/E ratios below 20, as of April 17.

The company also is perceived to be somewhat recession-resilient given its strong financial performance during and after the 2008 financial crisis.

Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.Since 2018, EPD’s dividend yield has gone from 6.5% to 8% with the annual per share payout growing from $1.72 to $1.96, +14%. The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow per share (what could be paid to us if management wanted to) has increased 22%, from $2.73 to $3.33, while leverage has come down a little over ½ a turn. So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio. We’ll continue to own this company unless the shares become meaningfully overvalued, and if it gets cheaper, we would be very comfortable owning more.”8. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.

It would do so with a view to supply Samsung Display with high-purity industrial gases. The expansion project will support Samsung Display’s multi-billion-dollar investment plan to transform its current LCD production line to OLED. Smartphones, virtual reality headsets and laptops are just a few products that make use of OLEDs.Linde's cutting-edge SPECTRA facility is expected to produce more than 2,000 tons of high purity nitrogen every day. This nitrogen will be used in cooling and purging procedures at Samsung Display's manufacturing units.The new facility will increase the size of Linde's present Tangjeong complex, which currently provides Samsung Display with industrial gases. The complex presently consists of four air separation units, along with associated pipeline network and infrastructure. The new plant will supply crude rare gases to Linde's new purification facility in neighboring Hyungok, in addition to supplying Samsung Display and the local merchant market. Linde is expected to invest approximately $100 million in this project, which is scheduled to begin operations toward the end of 2024.According to B.S. Sung, general manager South Korea, Linde, the company has been supplying various gases to Samsung Display for 20 years. He added that with this additional capacity in Tangjeong, Linde will be able to increase its network density in the region.

NUE surpassed resistance at the 20-day moving average, suggesting a short-term bullish trend.The 20-day simple moving average is a well-liked trading tool because it provides a look back at a stock's price over a 20-day period. Additionally, short-term traders find this SMA very beneficial, as it smooths out short-term price trends and shows more trend reversal signals than longer-term moving averages.Like other SMAs, if a stock's price is moving above the 20-day, the trend is considered positive. When the price falls below the moving average, it can signal a downward trend.NUE could be on the verge of another rally after moving 5.2% higher over the last four weeks. Plus, the company is currently a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stock.The bullish case solidifies once investors consider NUE's positive earnings estimate revisions. No estimate has gone lower in the past two months for the current fiscal year, compared to 4 higher, while the consensus estimate has increased too.With a winning combination of earnings estimate revisions and hitting a key technical level, investors should keep their eye on NUE for more gains in the near future.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

This change outpaced the S&amp;P 500's 0.09% gain on the day. At the same time, the Dow added 0.07%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq gained 0.98%.Heading into today, shares of the maker of scientific instrument and laboratory supplies had gained 1.93% over the past month, lagging the Medical sector's gain of 4.5% and the S&amp;P 500's gain of 4.59% in that time.Thermo Fisher Scientific will be looking to display strength as it nears its next earnings release, which is expected to be April 26, 2023. In that report, analysts expect Thermo Fisher Scientific to post earnings of $4.95 per share. This would mark a year-over-year decline of 31.72%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $10.57 billion, down 10.58% from the year-ago period.Looking at the full year, our Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $23.72 per share and revenue of $45.34 billion. These totals would mark changes of +2.07% and +0.95%, respectively, from last year.Investors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Thermo Fisher Scientific. These revisions help to show the ever-changing nature of near-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.The Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate remained stagnant. Thermo Fisher Scientific is holding a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now.Story continuesInvestors should also note Thermo Fisher Scientific's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 23.86. This valuation marks a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 25.22.Meanwhile, TMO's PEG ratio is currently 1.91. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Medical - Instruments was holding an average PEG ratio of 1.97 at yesterday's closing price.The Medical - Instruments industry is part of the Medical sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 97, putting it in the top 39% of all 250+ industries.The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

But even the best stock picker will only win with some selections. So we wouldn't blame long term U.S. Bancorp (NYSE:USB) shareholders for doubting their decision to hold, with the stock down 35% over a half decade. And it's not just long term holders hurting, because the stock is down 34% in the last year. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 28% in the last 90 days. We note that the company has reported results fairly recently; and the market is hardly delighted. You can check out the latest numbers in our company report.With the stock having lost 4.1% in the past week, it's worth taking a look at business performance and seeing if there's any red flags. See our latest analysis for U.S. Bancorp While markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).Looking back five years, both U.S. Bancorp's share price and EPS declined; the latter at a rate of 0.004% per year. This reduction in EPS is less than the 8% annual reduction in the share price. This implies that the market was previously too optimistic about the stock. The less favorable sentiment is reflected in its current P/E ratio of 9.12.The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers).earnings-per-share-growthDive deeper into U.S. Bancorp's key metrics by checking this interactive graph of U.S. Bancorp's earnings, revenue and cash flow.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR incorporates the value of any spin-offs or discounted capital raisings, along with any dividends, based on the assumption that the dividends are reinvested. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of U.S. Bancorp, it has a TSR of -22% for the last 5 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWe regret to report that U.S. Bancorp shareholders are down 31% for the year (even including dividends). Unfortunately, that's worse than the broader market decline of 3.6%. Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 4% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Take risks, for example - U.S. Bancorp has   1 warning sign   we think you should be aware of.For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Please note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.Have feedback on this article?

""While I am incredibly passionate about the work I do at U.S. Bank, I am equally dedicated to giving back to other women in the industry and in my local community. I know how important it is to share our knowledge and experience with one another.""That dedication motivates her to serve as an active member of the Women in Payments board and support its mission to connect, inspire and champion women in the payments industry.

""I give my time and energy now because I can. I know that any one of us may, at some point, need to receive assistance. We all need to recognize that giving and accepting help is part of our dedication to each other and our communities.""""If someone is just starting out in volunteer work, it's fine to start small but it's important to be consistent,"" Lyons said. ""Twenty years ago, I began dedicating time to acts of service to show my daughter the important role each of us has in supporting our community.

Please go ahead, sir.Story continuesJohn BrunoThank you, Elliot, and good morning, everyone. Once again, this is John Bruno. We appreciate your continued interest in PPG and welcome you to our First Quarter 2023 Financial Results Conference Call. Joining me on the call from PPG are Tim Knavish, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Vince Morales, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Our comments relate to the financial information released after U.S. equity markets closed on Thursday, April 20, 2023. We have posted detailed commentary and accompanying presentation slides on the Investor Center of our website, ppg.com. The slides are also available on the webcast site for this call to provide additional support for brief opening comments Tim will make shortly.

This presentation also contains certain non-GAAP financial measures. The company has provided in the appendix of the presentation materials, which are available on our website, reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. For additional information, please refer to PPG's filings with the SEC. Now let me introduce PPG President and CEO, Tim Knavish.Timothy M. KnavishThank you, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to welcome you to our First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I will keep my comments brief, providing a few highlights on our first quarter financial performance and on our outlook. Our first quarter sales were a record $4.4 billion and were achieved despite the backdrop of macro challenges, including soft global industrial activity, elevated cost inflation, continued geopolitical issues and weakening demand in U.S. construction-related end use markets. We delivered adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.82, which is 33% higher than the first quarter of 2022. Our operating segment margin recovery accelerated, improving 380 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2022 as we work back toward our historical profile. The first quarter was aided by incremental 2023 selling price increases in the Performance Coatings reporting segment and in total company-wide. We have now fully offset all cumulative cost inflation incurred since early 2021. As I highlight some of the key drivers that drove the strong first quarter performance, an overriding theme is around the benefits we are deriving from our diverse portfolio. For example, PPG has the largest and most diversified aerospace business in the coatings industry. We are well positioned to serve our customers in the aerospace aftermarket, and our backlogs expanded once again this quarter following the reopening in China as customers need to replenish their stock with PPG's technologically advantaged products, including sealants and transparencies. We expect this business to continue to grow for the remainder of 2023 and beyond. Also, PPG has the largest architectural coatings business in Mexico, where current economic conditions remain robust and among the best in the world. The PPG Comex business continued their strong execution and delivered an 11th consecutive quarter of record sales. We are laser-focused on driving organic growth. During the quarter, we benefited from several customer wins that included becoming the primary paint supplier at Walmart's 3,800 locations that carry paint products. The expansion of our well-recognized Glidden DIY brand at Walmart and in our independent dealer channel will support further growth opportunities. The automotive refinish business has now installed 1,400 global MOONWALK machines, recently gaining traction in the U.S. with additional rollouts planned globally. About 1/3 of these installations are new body shop wins. While overall demand conditions in Europe remain difficult, our leading position in automotive OEM in the region allowed us to support our customers during a sharp rise in automotive builds in the region, albeit off a historically low base. Our OEM sales volumes in the region were up mid-teen percentage for the quarter and we expect additional growth throughout 2023. The first quarter is typically a negative cash generation quarter due to our business seasonality. However, our strong earnings contributed to us generating positive operating cash flow in the first quarter for the first time in 7 years as our operating cash generated was about $400 million higher than the first quarter of 2022. Our financial results were better than our preliminary first quarter update on April 3. This was mostly attributable to stronger sales at the end of the month, a richer sales mix and lower costs than we predicted. A quick update to our very important ESG initiatives. We are prioritizing and delivering sustainably advantaged products and services to our customers and view this as a key lever for organic growth. Last year, we increased our sales from sustainably advantaged products to 39% of our total sales and continue to better define our product sustainability priorities to enable the sustainability ambitions of our customers. We look forward to sharing our new 2030 targets once our emissions reduction goals are validated by the Science-Based Targets Initiative. We will also be launching our 2022 ESG report in late May, which will include our progress against current environmental goals as well as our previously communicated diversity, equity and inclusion targets. Moving to our outlook. It is evident that challenges remain to the demand environment, and in some cases, such as U.S. housing and construction, they're weakening. Despite these anticipated headwinds, we remain confident that our margin recovery momentum will continue. We're executing against the shopping list of opportunities which we expect to contribute to strong year-over-year earnings growth in the second quarter and for the rest of 2023. This includes supporting our aerospace customers as they fulfill their strong order books, and we expect a second straight quarter of more than 10% sales volume growth year-over-year in this business. Also, as availability of raw materials returns to prepandemic levels, we expect our earnings to start benefiting from moderate deflation from recent historic inflation highs. As a reminder, aggregate raw material inflation since early 2021 remains at historically high levels. Additionally, our manufacturing is beginning to improve for multiyear production disruptions, and we expect this will generate efficiencies that will provide another earnings growth lever in the coming quarters. With respect to Europe, we are seeing coatings demand stabilize, albeit at lower levels, which will enable further year-over-year earnings growth, aided by the actioning against our restructuring program. PPG has leading architectural coatings positions in several countries in Europe. Once the economy begins to improve, this will provide an additional earnings growth lever. I'm also pleased with the growth prospects for our auto refinish, protective coatings and traffic solutions businesses. These end-use markets have proven to be more demand-resilient than in prior economic downturns, and a couple of these are positioned for further growth to support infrastructure investment in the United States. In China, we expect moderate and continuous sequential quarterly improvement in domestic demand as the year progresses. This will be more evident on a year-over-year basis given the pandemic-related restrictions in China last year during the second and fourth quarters. In summary, for the past few quarters, we have been conveying our strong conviction that various earnings growth catalysts would be activated. I am pleased that we have reached this inflection point and continue to have strong conviction, as reflected in our full year earnings guidance, that year-over-year earnings growth will continue, 2023. In addition, in this challenging macroeconomic period, you can also count on PPG's legacy of being highly focused on controlling the controllables, including managing our entire cost structure and optimizing our working capital. As I've begun my new role as CEO, I've challenged our team to focus on our advantages, prioritizing investments that will differentiate us and move the needle for our customers and our business. This includes advancing our digital capabilities throughout our businesses to improve our customers' productivity and further enhance our internal efficiencies. Our team is committed to accelerating earnings growth while preserving the strengths of PPG's legacy. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And Elliot, would you please open the line for questions?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs.Patrick Duffy FischerCongrats on a nice quarter. My question is mostly around the sequential EPS and how that relates to history. So if you stripped out 2020 and 2021 and looked at the 6 years before that and last year, Q1 to Q2 has averaged up about $0.48 with all of those years being above $0.40. And at the midpoint of your guide, you're only up $0.28 this year. So how do you match those 2? And then a similar question for first half versus second half. If you just use the midpoint of your guide, your second half is down $0.80 versus the first half. But in those same 7 years, if you look historically, it's averaged down about $0.30. So could be conservatism, could be something different in the seasonality, maybe something around the loading of Walmart. But can you just kind of walk through why we should expect a lower -- or why we shouldn't expect kind of the higher number of history to prevail?Timothy M. KnavishSure, Duffy. First of all, let me give you a few high-level comments, and I'll let Vince fill in the gaps. On the Q1 to Q2 step up, we definitely had some onetimers in Q1. Notably, the Walmart load-in, we had some insurance settlements related to past storms. We have a promotion for Comex Easter sales every year, more of those sales were pulled into Q1 than normal. And that's a big piece of the Q1 to Q2, and I'm sure Vince can give you more details. As for the rest of the year, we are cautious on volume for a number of reasons. Slower China opening of manufacturing. We're cautious on U.S. housing for the second half of the year. We're cautious on global industrial. So those are some of the few high levels. And Vince, do you want to add a few details?Vincent J. MoralesNo. I think we quantified the Walmart business. The load-in for us in Q1 was about $40 million. Again, just a little more color. The Comex business has a very large Easter campaign. The Easter campaign was split last year between Q1 and Q2. This year, most of the load occurred in Q1, so we're not going to have that traditional step up. And we did see really good activity in Europe auto. And again, our prediction is, while that's still going to be a very strong business, Q1 was a very strong European auto.OperatorOur next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird.Ghansham PanjabiCongrats on all the progress to start the year. I guess, first off on auto refinish and your outlook for directional improvement in 2Q. Is that just a function of comparability from the year-ago period and the China reopening? And also going back to some of the volume weakness in Europe and North America for auto refinish in the first quarter. Can you just give us some more color on the customer order pattern timing that you called out?Timothy M. KnavishYes. Sure. Thanks for the question, Ghansham. Let me start off by saying I have full confidence -- high confidence in our auto refinish business globally going forward as well as over the last several quarters because our key-to-key value proposition is best in class.What you see in refinish, if you look at Q4, then to Q1, then to what we're saying for Q2, this business, because of the two-step distribution, you really need to look at it over a multi-quarter basis just because it's hard sometimes to project the order pattern of our independent distribution. So I would look at Q1 in that light and rather look at, instead of an individual quarter, look at it over multiple quarters. But we have strong backlogs across the body shops, and it's really driven by two things other than paint. It's driven by parts shortages and it's driven by labor shortages, so those backlogs remain. And so this actual sellout to the collision industry remains strong. There's just some fluctuation in independent distribution ordering patterns.OperatorOur next question comes from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Stephen V. ByrneI'd like to drill in a little bit on your commercial strategy in U.S. architectural. It seems like you have a similar offering now at the independent hardware stores and Walmarts with this Glidden platform. And between those and The Home Depot arrangement and your own stores, it seems like it could be nearly 10,000 locations. My question for you is how would you split your sales in architectural paint in the U.S. between those various buckets? And where do you think that could go in the next few years? And could this cannibalize sales in your own stores?Timothy M. KnavishThanks, Steve. Great question. So we don't expect cannibalization. Let me explain a little bit about what we're doing. Glidden is by far our strongest and best-known DIY brand in the U.S. And historically, despite that strong brand strength, we lacked distribution. So obviously, we partner with The Home Depot with Glidden. We're now partnering with Walmart with Glidden. And we've always partnered with our independent dealers with Glidden. One of your points. Typically, we don't carry Glidden at our own company stores. So think about it as big box home improvement plus Walmart plus private dealers. The type of customer that buys paint at Walmart is very different than the type of customer that buys paint at The Home Depot. And so what we're really doing with these recent moves is expanding distribution and providing access to the strong DIY brand across multiple different types of consumers, multiple different price points of consumers and expanded geography. So that's really what we're doing here, and there's very little conflict between those 3 pieces and certainly very little cannibalism.OperatorOur next question comes from John McNulty from BMO.John Patrick McNultyTim, your first quarter margins, I don't think we've seen them this high other than maybe twice in the last 15 years, and that's even with adding traffic solutions, which I think should be dragging it down in 1Q. So I guess, one, where can we see margins go this year for PPG? And then what are some of the big factors? Is it all price versus raws? How should we think about mix, some of the efficiency measures you were speaking to? I guess can you help us to frame that a bit?Timothy M. KnavishWell, we're on -- as you've heard me say, John, we are on a margin recovery journey. And as happy as we are with the 380 basis point improvement, we're pleased with that progress, but we are not satisfied with where we are. We are not back to historical levels. We've still got more work to do, and we're confident that we will continue to see improvement. This, frankly, is our second straight quarter of year-over-year margin improvement. We expect Q2 to be the third straight quarter of year-over-year margin improvement. But we've got more work to do here. And it's both on the value capture side and getting paid for the products and services that we deliver. It's mix driven. And certainly, we've begun to see some moderation on the cost side.Vincent J. MoralesJohn, this is Vince. Just to get some more numeric guidance here. We're down still 150, 200 basis points versus our prior high-water marks, which we hit several times and -- several times in the past 10 years in the first quarter. So we have other levers. Tim mentioned one in the opening comments. We're still not back to where we want to be on manufacturing. Our volumes on a multiyear basis are still down. And again, cost control, which is a legacy here, we feel we could do better. So we still have multiple levers to get back to prior high-water marks and then eventually hoping to exceed those.OperatorOur next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho.Christopher S. ParkinsonCan you just offer a little bit more color about what's embedded in both your aerospace and refinish guidance levels? Just how you're thinking about it for the year? Does aerospace include Boeing's further build rates? 737 MAX in China? Widebody? Some color on that. And then on the refinish side, just any color about how you think the body shop world, specifically in the U.S., is still dealing with labor constraints and so on and so forth. You had some pretty optimistic -- or actually, bullish comments for the second quarter. It'd just be great to know what's underscoring that in particular versus '19 levels.Timothy M. KnavishSure. Thanks, Chris. So on the aero side, you mentioned a number of things there, and the answer would be yes to all of them. We have a number of positive catalysts there. The China reopening, even though China -- international China widebody is still well below 2019 levels, domestic travel alone drives a lot of MRO activity for us. So that, we expect to continue to grow. You mentioned one of our big OEM customers. You've seen their 2023 output so far is much better. So that certainly helps. We've got -- the backlog continues to grow on both OEM and aftermarket, particularly on the MRO side. So -- or I'm sorry, on the transparency side. So we've got some catch-up of that backlog built into our planning. And the military segment remains very strong. So a lot of what we've got built in is the underlying demand strength, but also our ability to continue to increase our output because right now, in many parts of our business in aerospace, we can sell whatever we can produce. On the refinish side. Again, you have to take out these quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. Fundamentally, the collision business is still very strong. And so if the body shops are able to get more cars through because they're able to improve supply on parts, improve labor, we're in a much better supply situation because most of our supply dynamics are behind us. So we're really poised to capture whatever throughput output -- I'm sorry, throughput increase they're able to achieve, which they're highly motivated to do because their backlogs are so strong.Vincent J. MoralesJust to put some numbers to the -- this is Vince. Just to put some numbers to the China aerospace opportunity. International flights to and from China are down about 70% versus prepandemic still. Domestic travel in China is down about 20% versus prepandemic. Big -- obviously big market for all the aerospace players. And again, for us, that's all opportunity in both OEM and our aftermarket business.OperatorOur next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.David L. BegleiterTim, just on raw materials. What's embedded in your second half guidance in terms of declines year-over-year? And just on pricing, where are you still implementing price increases?Timothy M. KnavishSure. Thanks, David. On raw materials, well, let's start with -- the high-level statement is we expect to continue to see moderation as we move through the year. And what we actually realized in Q1 was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. We expect Q2 to be about low single digits down on a year-over-year basis. And beyond that, we expect continued further moderation, but hard to quantify the scale of that at this point because there's still so many moving parts. But that's what I would say on the raw material side.On the pricing side, we did achieve more pricing in Q1. We were up 8% in total. About 70% of that is carryover. We were able to achieve some additional pricing in the quarter on an incremental basis. The vast majority of that being in the Performance Coatings segment. So I think as we move forward on price, we'll comp -- we'll start to comp higher increases as we move through the year from last year, so the increments will be smaller. But we are highly confident that for Q2, Q3, Q4, we will print positive price numbers.Vincent J. MoralesAnd just a reminder, we're still at a 40-year high inflation rates in our sector, even with this moderation.OperatorOur next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.Jeffrey John ZekauskasTwo-part question. So first, when you look at your auto OEM prices in the quarter, were they comparable to the industrial segment in general? That is, industrial was up, I don't know, maybe 8%? Is that what auto OEM prices did? Or were they higher or were they lower? Can you calibrate that? And second...Vincent J. MoralesJeff, they were certainly in line. Sorry, go ahead.Jeffrey John ZekauskasYes. I'm puzzled that your raw materials were flat year-over-year in that oil was $100 a barrel in the first quarter of '22 and propylene was $0.60 a pound. And I believe that maybe your raw materials probably peaked in the second quarter of 2022 and then came down. So like where is the inflation coming from? Or there must be something -- it seems to be unusual about your raw material basket in that it should be lower than where it was in the first quarter of last year, at least from an outside perspective.Timothy M. KnavishJeff, I'm going to take the auto question. So yes, auto OEM was consistent with segment pricing, which was about that 8%. And again, I want to remind you, the vast majority of that is carryover, especially in that business. And the new pricing there, much of that was actually negotiated last year. And part of the part of the process in negotiations with auto OEMs is magnitude and timing of implementation. So that's the answers to your first question. Vince, do you want to take raws?Vincent J. MoralesYes. Jeff, I think when you look at our raw materials, one of the things we've talked about the last several quarters was pulling that through our inventory. And if you look, we ended the year -- we talked about this in the back half of last year. We ended Q3 and Q4 with abnormally high inventory balances. We were buying raw materials where we -- when we can get them. So we have to work that inventory down. If you look at our inventory balance actually in Q1, it's still elevated relative to what our expectations are. So it's really a matter of how we're pulling those prior purchases through our inventory and into our cost of sales. We still have some, again, inventory to work down as we get into the peak season here in Q2. And we'll see some more realized benefit once we are able to work through that inventory.Timothy M. KnavishYes. Jeff, to your basket question, our raw material basket is largely what it's always been. But there are parts of that raw material basket that we're still seeing year-over-year inflation in. Pigments, additives, extenders, inorganics, a number of items where we're still seeing year-over-year increase.OperatorOur next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.Vincent Stephen AndrewsI'm wondering if you could just help us better understand how March went. It sounds like, obviously, it was stronger than you expected, particularly in the back half of the quarter. In which particular areas of your business did that strength came in? And if there was any particular driving force for it and whether it's continued into April so far? To the extent you have data you can share.Timothy M. KnavishSure. Sure, Vincent. The parts of our business that were very strong as we moved through March, I would say, our aerospace business; our auto business, particularly Europe auto; and as Vince alluded to earlier, our Comex business was stronger than we had expected as we saw more pull-forward of the Easter campaign.Vincent J. MoralesAnd just a reminder, when we said this in January, March is typically 40%, 50% of the quarter in terms of the size of the quarter financially. So again, when we have a strong March, it's very helpful.OperatorOur next question comes from Josh Spector from UBS.Joshua David SpectorSo I just want to poke on the guidance again for the year. So if I think about some of the onetimers in 1Q, if I say they're maybe $0.20 in EPS, seasonally adjust first half, implies the year's kind of at the midpoint of your guidance for the year about, $7.10. No incremental benefit from raw materials. And the areas where you talk about volume weakness, China housing, industrial, maybe we're talking about 20%, 25% of your sales, but you're optimistic on auto OEM, refinish, aero, which more than offsets that. So I mean, is it a fair take to look at this and say, there's really minimal benefit of raw materials in the second half, similar benefit of pricing, and you're just like pushing on where volumes are today? Or is that an entirely wrong way to look at it?Timothy M. KnavishWell, on our second half guide, first thing I'll say is it's still 10% EPS growth Y-o-Y in an extremely challenging environment. And so I just want to lead with that. And most of the concern for second half is more volume focused. We're continued slowdown, U.S. housing. We've got uncertainty on the general industrial side. And really, uncertainty on the pace of recovery of industrial/manufacturing in China. So those are really the key drivers to the second half.Vincent J. MoralesYes, this is Vince, I'll just add. Again, it's still cloudy when we look at the economy. We do know that most countries are raising interest rates. There's typically a delay between interest rate increases and consumer effect. We're seeing that in different parts of our portfolio around the world. So we just remain somewhat cautious on the delayed effect on that interest rate increase environment.As Tim mentioned, I'll echo, we're not sure about the pace of recovery in China. We do feel it's going to be -- our guide includes a moderate recovery, a continuing, elongated recovery. That's beneficial from our perspective because we don't see that creating more commodity inflation, but that -- the pace of that recovery is still uncertain at this time.OperatorOur next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from [KeyCorp].Aleksey V. YefremovIn architectural in the U.S., can you share any data or sentiment from Pro paint contractors? How is the backlog changing here?Timothy M. KnavishYes. Backlogs have remained surprisingly robust despite everything you see in the news and despite what's happening in construction, driven by labor shortages primarily. So the backlogs remain strong. And for our Pro business, the omnichannel of our Pro business was up almost 10% for the quarter. So we are seeing continued good activity in the Pro space in architectural United States.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo.Michael Joseph SisonNice start to the year. Tim, just curious, in terms of the second half with the 10% EPS growth, I apologize if I missed this, but what do you expect for volumes? What's sort of the range of outcomes for the company? Is it down, flat, maybe even up on easy comps? Just curious.John BrunoMike, this is John. I'll take that one. So as Tim pointed, there's a few factors that we're considering in the volumes forecast that's in the guide. I would say that it's down slightly in our second half guidance, Mike, overall, based on all the feedback that Tim provided.OperatorOur next question comes from Peter Clark from Societe Generale.Peter Anthony John ClarkJust looking at your #1 priority of getting your margin back, and particularly on the Industrial Coatings, because obviously, you were peaking at over 18%. I know there's been mix changes. You bought in lower-margin acquisitions that you're working on. But if I play with your full year guidance, you're sort of inferring this margin recovering to about 14%, ex-amortization. So you're still 400 basis points adrift. I understand it's challenging, volumes are still not great, but is there anything structurally that stops you getting back to that sort of level in the next few years that you were achieving back in '16 and '17 level?Timothy M. KnavishYes. Thanks for the question. There's nothing structurally preventing us from getting back to those levels. The big driver for us, I would say 2 things. Number one, volume. Volume is still down significantly from the time periods that you referenced, and so just the leverage from that. And then the other one is operating efficiencies. All of the supply chain disruptions that we've had over the last couple of years, our manufacturing costs have not been at benchmark. And you heard that we did see some improvement in that in Q1, and we're expecting further improvement as we move forward. So there's nothing structurally preventing us from getting back to peak margins in that segment.OperatorOur next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC.Arun Shankar ViswanathanJust a couple of questions around margins. It looks like your margins were up at around 13% level for EBIT in the first quarter. Do you see continued growth there? And what kind of volume growth would you expect to get that back into the mid-teens to high-teens level?Timothy M. KnavishWell, we absolutely expect to see continued margin growth. Arun, as I mentioned earlier, we're confident that the next couple of quarters will show continued year-over-year margin improvement. The volume question, as John mentioned, we're going to have volume challenges likely. Potentials for upside. But our base case is that it will be a tougher-volume second half.Vincent J. MoralesYes, Arun, this is Vince. If you look at some of the nearer-term levers we have, the rich mix we benefited from in Q1, we expect to continue against some of our key technology businesses, aerospace, automotive. Tim mentioned about the strength of the Mexican economy. We have leading positions in Mexico in several of our businesses, including Comex. And as Tim mentioned, we're starting to see early signs of manufacturing optimization. Still a long -- we still have a long way to go there, but that's something internally we're managing. And as I mentioned earlier, we have laser focus on our costs, especially with the volume outlook and the concern around consumer spending that I talked about earlier.OperatorOur next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from VRP.Kevin William McCarthyA few questions on your auto OEM coatings business. What are you baking in for global builds in terms of your annual EPS guide? And would you also comment on any meaningful share shifts by region? And how the EV penetration is playing out for PPG.Timothy M. KnavishSure. Thanks, Kevin. Our base case on auto OEM for the year on builds is low single digits with potential for upside, depending what happens with a whole number of things around affordability in China. But our base case is low single digits. We have not seen a huge amount of share shift. We did see some in China. As we were executing our margin recovery strategy, we did lose some of the lower-margin business. But what's historically happened there, Kevin, is they ultimately come back for a number of reasons. And third part of your question was around the EVs. What I could say on EVs is we're extremely pleased with our progress there. We're winning on EVs where EVs are winning, which is China. So we're doing well with the #1 China EV player, and they're doing well. If you look at builds now of EVs, they were up. Over 10% of global builds now are EVs. And in China, which is where we're having most of our success, over 20% now of all vehicles sold in China are EVs. So we like what we're seeing from a penetration standpoint, and we're pleased with our progress, but still a lot more to do there.Vincent J. MoralesJust to add. Again, we came into the year with a low to mid-single-digit projection on global builds for the year. Q1 was -- for the industry was 5%. So Q1 outperformed the initial projections for the industry.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Leithead with Barclays.Michael James LeitheadReal briefly, just on North American architectural, there's obviously a few moving pieces with all the wins you flagged. So I guess, high level, what do you assume or you think the industry is growing at this year versus what do you think PPG is going to be able to grow at?Timothy M. KnavishI think it's -- the reality is these three in totality is going to be soft, driven by what's happened on 2 fronts. Number one, housing. And number two, you still have some post-COVID hangover from the DIY side due to what everybody did, painting their houses during that period. So industry-wide, that's what we're seeing. For PPG, we've got a number of programs, as you say, with obviously our Walmart win, the launch of The Home Depot Pro program. Our mix, we're not as big on new build as we are on construction and maintenance. So we're thinking about it a little bit better than the rest of the industry. But driven by housing and driven by DIY, we expect this overall to be a challenging year in architectural U.S.Vincent J. MoralesYes. And Mike, just another reminder here. We're -- paint is typically the last part of the cycle. So as housing starts have come down the past several quarters, we're still working off those backlogs from a paint perspective. If you look at the mixture of housing starts, roughly 60% are single-family. Those have come down already. I'm not sure if they bottomed yet or not. There's some positive signs that they at least flattened. If you look at multifamily, multifamily is a still a very high record. And those will be delivered late this year or maybe early next year. And we do think there's an air pocket after that due to the credit liquidity, et cetera. Again, 60% single-family, 40% multifamily. So we haven't seen the negative effects yet in multifamily.OperatorOur next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.Laurence AlexanderCould you just briefly flesh out your outlook for U.S. infrastructure? And particularly kind of sort of your assumptions for the back half of the year. And the landscape for -- or the pipeline for potential bolt-on M&amp;A. And particularly, like how you're thinking about opportunities in the emerging market.Timothy M. KnavishYes. Sure, Laurence. On the outlook for infrastructure, we're quite positive on that as the infrastructure spending is starting and there's a lot more projects in the queue. And we have a number of portfolio positions that should help us there. Our Protective Coatings business, some of our Industrial Coatings business and certainly, our traffic solutions business. So we're positive on that ramping up as we move through not only this year but into the future.Vincent J. MoralesYes, Laurence, on the M&amp;A environment. Yes, I'd still say it's somewhat active, not consistent. Historically, it's been more active. There's certainly some deals or some files that are percolating of the small kind of vintage. So there's still an issue, if you're a buyer or a seller, coming up with a price based on the past 12-month financials. Again, we said many times, we would expect a few deals to get done in our space each year, and that's our same expectation this year.OperatorOur next question comes from Laurent Favre from Exane BNP Paribas.Laurent Guy FavreTwo very quick questions, please. The first one is on manufacturing. Can you size that opportunity for us? And is it just about China where you see the COVID issues in the early part of Q1? Or do you also see an opportunity in Europe and U.S.? And the second question was just on marine and protective. It sounds like that was a bit a surprise for you in Q1. You thought it would be down, was up. I'm just wondering if you can share a few thoughts there.John BrunoLaurent, this is John. I'll start with the manufacturing one, and Tim will take the second part. So if you go back to January of '22, we talked about significant manufacturing challenges we had due to supply disruptions in the fourth quarter of '21. We quoted about a $0.20 EPS impact. That was the height of the impacts. And every quarter since, we've had some type of negativity. Now this quarter, the first quarter of 2023, we were close to being breakeven on a year-over-year basis, and we expect that to get better as we go forward. So the objective is for us to claw back all of the inefficiencies that we've had in the last 5 quarters.Timothy M. KnavishYes, I'll take the protective and marine side. The way I think about this business right now is it's well positioned for infrastructure, near-shoring, energy, a lot of the investments that are happening around those areas. And also in marine, where we have really pivoted our focus to marine aftermarket, which is doing well. So when you add those all together, we were up high single digits in Q1, and we expect to be up mid-single digits again in Q2. So that's one of the businesses that we're pretty bullish on.OperatorOur next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research.Frank Joseph MitschCongrats on the start to the year. Vince, you took a $144 million charge due to the pension benefit obligation. I'm curious as to what sort of future cost benefit might we expect from that action? And Tim, obviously, very impressive progress on price. And your expectation is that you're going to have positive price for the balance of the year. But as we see deflation from record raws, any concerns on potential price givebacks in any of your businesses?Vincent J. MoralesThanks, Frank. This is Vince. Yes, just a reminder, we do have a step up in 2023, a noncash step-up as it relates to pension expense, fairly significant, $10 million to $15 million a quarter. We did annuitize a portion of our pension plan. The benefit from that from an expense perspective is fairly minimal. It's about $1 million or $2 million a quarter. So nothing sizable relative to the step-up we've had coming into the year.Timothy M. KnavishYes. And Frank, on price, so on protective, we expect very little, if any, any price givebacks as we -- I'm sorry. I said protective, I meant performance. On performance in total, we expect very little giveback as we move through the year. On industrial, I'll remind, about 30% of our industrial segment business, the pricing is based on index arrangements. So if there is raw material deflation, those indexes will kick in, but there's a delay of multiple quarters depending on the contract. So that's more of a '24 issue for us. And beyond that, more generally, I'd say, we -- obviously, we watch this very closely every day. And churn would be our primary indicator if there's something we need to act upon. Our competitors are facing the same basic cost structure and cost inputs that we are. And we watch our churn. And to date, we've seen very little churn, as I mentioned earlier, other than a little bit in Asia.OperatorOur next question comes from John Roberts from Credit Suisse.John Ezekiel E. RobertsWhere within the performance segment were you able to get additional price? Or was that mix with the aerospace business just improving in the mix?Timothy M. KnavishWell, they were both factors. The mix element part of it was our aerospace business, no doubt. As the first part on where we're able to get price, we got incremental price in almost all parts of our performance segment, so architectural, refinish. And I'd just remind that, while we are seeing moderation in some raw material inflation, we're still seeing inflation in wages and indirects and some raw material categories. So I'd say that incremental price was largely in response to incremental inflation.Vincent J. MoralesYes, John, this is Vince. Just for clarity, we -- as we break out these numbers for you guys externally, we have price separate. We put in business mix, regional mix, product mix. We combine that with volume. And if you look at both our original guide and our updated guide or updated final numbers, we benefited from incremental pricing, stand-alone pricing, so invoice pricing. Secondarily and separately, we benefited from regional mix. Tim mentioned some of our business, including Latin America, were higher than our expectations. We benefited from business mix. Some of our higher technology businesses were higher than our expectation, as we called out in both of our releases. And we benefited within business from product mix. So we hit, I think, the 3 big categories for us.OperatorOur final question today comes from Jaideep Pandya from On Field Research.Jaideep Mukesh PandyaFirst one, to go back to the EV point. Could you just give us some color on what is the content per vehicle for ICE versus EV? And in your top EV customers, are they all sort of the top 5 Chinese companies? That's my first question. And the second question is on the Industrial Coatings, where you alluded to weakness in the U.S. Have you seen sort of the destocking coming to an end in Q1? Or are you expecting further destocking or weaker volumes from the coil extrusion categories in the U.S., especially in Q2 and Q3?Timothy M. KnavishThanks, Jaideep. I'm going to go backwards with how you asked them. Just destocking, the -- our industrial segment businesses, there's not a tremendous amount of inventory held at our customers. And so any significant destocking, whether it's -- frankly, whether it's industrial or performance, is largely behind us. But the softening that we mentioned in general industrial and in particular here in the U.S. is across a couple of key segments. One of them you already mentioned, and that's coil because that's largely tied to construction. But we've also seen softness in some consumer-facing areas, electronic materials, kitchen and bakeware appliance. Fortunately, there's some positives offsetting some of that as well on HD -- heavy-duty equipment, transportation, powder. But in general, those were the segments that were a bit soft. On your EV question. So the content per vehicle, unfortunately, there's not a simple one-number answer to do that because it depends upon the different technologies that are adopted by each of the OEMs. But what I will tell you is that the potential content per vehicle for functional and specialty protective coatings is significant and in the same scale as the content per vehicle of conventional layering systems, which can -- that can range between $90 to $125 a vehicle. You had a question embedded in there about who are we working with, who are we successful with in China. Generally speaking, we're working with all of the OEMs, whether it's Chinese or non-Chinese. But we have had most of our commercial success thus far with the #1 player in EVs in China.Vincent J. MoralesJaideep, this is Vince. I want to go back to your industrial question and maybe broaden it a little bit. If you think about PPG, 2022 was a difficult year. We had significant exposure in Europe, where we saw the geopolitical items really affect our volumes. As everybody is fully aware, China had multiple months of shutdowns in 2022. And the U.S. was one of our most stable businesses. And Mexico and Latin America continued to grow. If you fast forward into 2023, we feel Europe stabilized, and we're able to then put our cost stewardship on that. We feel China and Asia is going to grow. So 2 big pieces of our portfolio pointing in the right direction as it compared to last year. And we still feel very strong about Latin America and grow, and we're seeing some softness in the U.S. in industrial, certainly in the construction markets. But we're offsetting the majority of that with aerospace and automotive, protective, as Tim mentioned. So again, I think for us, we had a difficult 2022, and we're lapping some of that in 2023. The only thing we see softening is really those pockets in the U.S.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to John Bruno.John BrunoThank you, Elliot. We appreciate everyone's continued interest and confidence in PPG. This concludes our First Quarter Earnings Call.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.]"

Nick Green, Thrive Market co-founder and CEO, told Yahoo Finance offering less selection on its website helps keep prices low.""Instead of going into a grocery store and having 40,000 non-perishable SKUs [stock keeping units], we've got about 5,000 or 6,000, which gives us more purchasing power...despite the inflation, we've been able to be pretty resilient in keeping our prices low, certainly relative to competitors,"" Green told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).In March, the cost of groceries went up 8.3% compared to a year prior. And although grocery inflation is down from the 13.5% peak seen in August 2022, higher grocery prices still weigh on consumer budgets and keep them looking for value.In 2022, Thrive Market brought in nearly $500 million in revenue. Thrive Market has approximately 1.2 million paid members and a valuation of more than $1 billion, based on the company's latest funding round.An annual $60 annual subscription fee for members helps to drive prices lower too, Green said. ""By getting our margin from membership, it actually gives us a lot of flexibility to push our price as low as we possibly can.""Another strategy to keep prices low is asking members to spend at least $49 to qualify for free shipping.Green said this minimum encourages customers to add more to their order and said the threshold is ""less about cost and a lot more about our mission"" to make healthy, sustainable living affordable and accessible to all.Typically, a Thrive Market order has more than 15 items and more than $90 worth of products.""The impact of that is good for the business. It means we can actually offer more savings because we don't have as much cost in shipping and packaging and that's really good for the environment where we can use ground shipping,"" Green said. ""So we're able to get to more than half our members in one day or less on shipping. We're able to get to 95% in two days or less.""Story continues(Courtesy: Thrive Market) (Elisha Knight | Thrive Market)While Thrive Market competes with the growing online grocery space, which is expected reach $235.86 billion in sales by 2026, Green said the company's ""profits and the purpose go hand in hand.""On Wednesday, the company converted to a Public Benefit Corporation.Green said many outsiders assume a mission to serve people, purpose, and the planet will come at the expense of profits. ""We really found the exact opposite to be the case,"" Green said, because the ""mission resonates with people"" and leads to customer loyalty, renewal rates, and referrals.Onesies and twosiesMore packages and day-of deliveries means more problems for the planet, Green said.Once consumers learn about that impact, he said they decide to turn away from mega companies known for that like Amazon (AMZN).""People order on Amazon for those onesy, twosies because they can,"" Green said. ""Once you tell people what the impact of that is on the environment, a lot of them do want to change their purchasing behaviors.""In a typical day, Amazon ships approximately 1.6 million packages, per the Amazon seller software tool LandingCube. That means 66,000 orders are delivered every hour.Green explained the impact: ""If you're trying to deliver day-of, your carbon footprint is going to be a lot higher.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, you can directly visit Analysts Are Upgrading These 5 Stocks.Although the equity markets have been buoyed by the expectation of lower interest rates this year, we may likely see an increase in volatility as earnings estimates are revised downward. This week, we expect a pickup in U.S. first-quarter earnings results. Some major banks have already reported, beating market expectations for profits. However, according to FactSet data, first-quarter earnings are expected to experience the largest decline in three years, marking the second consecutive quarter of such declines. Amid this doom and gloom situation, analysts are upgrading stocks such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), among many others.The market experienced a quiet evening and morning with little news to report on April 20. Stocks in the US and Europe remained steady, while Europe's composite reading saw a jump thanks to service strength, despite softness in manufacturing. Japan's core CPI exceeded the St consensus, but the BOJ isn't expected to take any policy actions at the next meeting. Chinese stocks fell, with the media citing ""Biden's investment curbs,"" but the curbs have been anticipated for some time. Bloomberg reports that the PBOC will scale back pandemic-era stimulus measures, but China's domestic macro story remains strong. While there were no significant developments in earnings reports since the US close, several large industrial firms have expressed optimism about the global growth outlook.Chuck Grom, an analyst at Gordon Haskett, upgraded Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) rating from Accumulate to Buy. At the same time, UBS analyst John Hodulik upgraded Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) from Neutral to Buy. Meanwhile, notable stocks, including Coterra Energy Inc.

UDR, a premier multifamily real estate investment trust (REIT), is set to announce its first-quarter 2023 earnings results on Apr 26 after market close. The company, known for owning, operating, acquiring and developing high-quality apartment communities across the United States, has been a strong choice for investors seeking exposure to the flourishing multifamily real estate sector.In this preview, we will discuss UDR's recent performance, the resurgence in the U.S. apartment market, and what investors can expect from UDR's first-quarter 2023 earnings.Q4 2022 RecapIn the last reported quarter, this Denver, CO-based residential REIT came up with funds from operations (FFO) as adjusted per share of 61 cents, in line with the consensus mark. The quarterly results reflected a year-over-year rise in revenues, driven by healthy operating trends and past accretive external growth investments. However, higher same-store expenses were a headwind.In the last four quarters, UDR’s FFO as adjusted per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on one occasion and met the same on the other three, the average surprise being 0.42%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. price-eps-surprise | United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteU.S. Apartment Market ReboundFirst-quarter data from RealPage Market Analytics shows that the U.S. apartment market has experienced a rebound in net apartment demand, ending a streak of three consecutive quarters of negative absorption. The market added 19,243 net new renters in the quarter, signaling a return to positive territory. Occupancy rates continued to slide but at a much lesser degree than before, coming in at 94.7% in March, matching the pre-pandemic decade average.In March, same-store effective asking rents for new lease signers increased 0.3%, with effective asking rents up 3.9% year over year, marking the first time below 4% since April 2021. These trends suggest that somewhat normal seasonality is returning to the market after a three-year absence due to the pandemic.Story continuesQ1 2023 Expectations for UDRWith the resurgence in the U.S. apartment market, it's likely that UDR will capitalize on positive trends to deliver a strong performance in the first quarter of 2023. The rebound in net apartment demand is likely to have resulted in healthy occupancy rates and rental growth, driving revenues for the multifamily REIT.Per its first-quarter 2023 Investor Presentation, UDR’s blended lease rate growth accelerated from December to February. This supported its first-quarter 2023 blended lease rate growth expectation of 3.3% to 3.9%. We estimate same-store physical occupancy at 96.7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is currently pegged at $404.46 million. This indicates a 13.2% year-over-year rise. This growth is anticipated to be fueled by the recovering demand for rental housing, high occupancy rates and rent growth.Additionally, UDR enjoys a decent balance sheet position and banks on technological moves and process enhancements to fuel growth. This residential REIT focuses on enhancing cost control through its Next Generation Operating Platform. UDR projected first-quarter 2023 FFO as adjusted per share in the range of 59-61 cents.Before the first-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO as adjusted per share has remained unchanged at 61 cents in the past month. However, this suggests year-over-year growth of 10.9%.Potential Risks and ChallengesDespite the optimistic outlook, UDR faces certain risks and challenges that could impact its first-quarter 2023 performance. These include potential headwinds from interest rate hikes, which could increase borrowing costs and affect the company's ability to refinance existing debt.We expect interest expenses to grow 17.1% year over year in the first quarter. Furthermore, the multifamily real estate sector could face oversupply concerns, leading to increased competition and lower rent growth.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for UDR this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.UDR currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -1.46%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.However, our model shows that Equity Residential EQR and Independence Realty Trust, Inc. IRT have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.Equity Residential is slated to report quarterly numbers on Apr 25. EQR has an Earnings ESP of +0.31% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3 presently.Independence Realty Trust, scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Apr 26, has an Earnings ESP of +4.82% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.ConclusionInvestors will closely monitor UDR's first-quarter 2023 earnings results to evaluate the company's ability to capitalize on favorable market conditions and maintain its growth trajectory. With a strategic focus on high-demand markets, strong demographics and a robust balance sheet, UDR seems well-positioned to deliver solid results in the first quarter of 2023, benefiting from the rebound in the U.S. apartment market. However, investors should remain mindful of potential risks, such as interest rate increases and oversupply, which may impact the multifamily real estate sector.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of Al Gore's sustainable investing, and go directly to read 5 Best Environmental Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Al Gore. Al Gore is an American politician, investor, environmentalist, and advocate for climate action. In addition to his political career, Al Gore is widely known for his work in raising awareness about climate change and promoting environmental activism. He is the founder and chairman of The Climate Reality Project, a non-profit organization focused on climate education and advocacy. He co-founded Generation Investment Management (GIM) in 2004, which follows a peculiar investment approach. The hedge fund employs a variety of strategies to identify and invest in sustainable companies, including analyzing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, engaging with company management to encourage sustainable practices, and seeking out companies that are leaders in their industries in terms of sustainability.Earlier this year, Gore spoke about climate change at an annual meeting of the World Economic Forum’s session at Davos. He said that the crisis is worsening at a rapid pace. He also lauded Greta Thunberg’s recent actions to prevent the expansion of coal mines in Germany. Here are some comments from the environmentalist:“There are a lot of words and there are some meaningful commitments, but we are still failing badly. We need to have a supermajority process instead of unanimity in the COP.

These stakes have a total value of over $3.78 billion. Davis Advisers mentioned Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in its annual 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“If Berkshire represents “growing value” then Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) might be said to represent “undervalued growth.” Founded more than a half century ago, Applied Materials has grown to be the largest supplier of manufacturing tools, services and software to the semiconductor industry. Holding more than 15,000 patents, Applied has become the irreplaceable supplier to the critical global growth industry, semiconductors. Because this company’s earnings can be uneven, short-sighted investors often label this company as “cyclical” and assign it a relatively low valuation.We disagree and, having perused more than 50 years of data, conclude that Applied is unquestionably a growth company trading at a value price. Figure 8 shows the two sustainable drivers of this growth. The green bars indicate that semiconductor manufacturers have grown industry revenue at 7.5% over the last decade, more than three times the growth of the U.S. economy over this same decade. The orange line indicates that the percentage of this revenue that the industry commits to capital spending has gradually risen from roughly 20% to 30%. Putting these two trends together, it should come as no surprise that Applied has grown revenue at a rate of 11%, and operating income at more than 19% over this same time period.In the near term, the impact of the chip industry’s post-pandemic inventory correction, which could reduce equipment demand, may more than offset the benefit of recent supply chain issues that limited Applied Materials’ ability to meet customer demand. Longer term, geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. are driving investment in potentially redundant chip production globally, while at the same time the U.S. and her allies are restricting export of leading edge production tools into China. Even though the near term is frustratingly veiled in uncertainty, the recent shortages and trade restrictions have firmly established that access to chip-production technology is essential to every major industrial economy. Given this, we see more opportunity than risk and estimate that Applied Materials could sell at about 10 times what the company could be earning three-to-five years from now.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Environmental Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Al Gore. Suggested articles:Cathie Wood’s Stock Portfolio: 2023 Stock Picks12 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates10 Eyecare Stocks with Upside PotentialDisclosure.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 largest coal mining companies in USA.One of the most controversial industries of our time, the U.S. coal industry has been the target of climate change activists for a while now, but regardless, still enjoyed a bumper 2022. Before we discuss 2022, let's discuss some of the trends in the past several years, going back to two decades, which have had a huge impact on what was once one of the biggest industries in the country.After climate change started to be taken seriously by most governments in developed countries, laws and regulations aiming to incentivize renewable energy companies and discourage fossil fuel consumption started to be passed, which is also why the most advanced countries in renewable energy are dominated by developed nations. In 2019, coal production had fallen 40% from the peak achieved in 2008, while in the last century, coal employees have fallen from nearly 900,000 to just 43,000. Because of these regulations, several coal giants, including some corporations which were among the largest coal mining companies in USA, had to file for bankruptcy. In 2015 alone, four listed coal companies filed for bankruptcy, including the fourth-largest such company at the time in Alpha Natural Resources. By 2016 alone, around a quarter of all coal companies had filed for bankruptcy or were in the bankruptcy process as mining downturn hit the industry severely. Between 2011 to 2016, the price of coal had fallen by 50% and the industry overall was heavily in debt to the tune of billions of dollars.12 largest mining companies in USACopyright: vyacheslavsvetlichnyy / 123RF Stock PhotoIn the U.S., coal production is heavily focused in a few states, with Wyoming being the biggest coal producer in the country by a mile, accounting for over 41% of total production, while Wyoming, Pennsylvania and West Virginia combined account for over 60% of the company's total coal production. One of the main reasons behind the decline of coal has been the focus on alternative sources, both renewable and non-renewable. While the biggest growth is easily witnessed by some of the largest renewable energy companies by market cap, even natural gas electricity production increased to 38% of the country's total electricity production in 2022, 1% up from 2021 and will then fall back to 36% in 2023. Meanwhile, coal electricity production fell from 23% in 2021 to 20% in 2022 while the decline will continue in 2023, falling to 19%.Story continuesWhile the last several years have not been very positive for the coal mining industry, 2022 was a bumper year for the industry overall, after oil prices increased significantly and an energy crisis gripped Europe due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia is among the biggest oil and gas exporters in the world, and after its war with Ukraine, sanctions were imposed by Western nations and European nations looked elsewhere for energy supplies, all of which was a boon to the coal industry. According to the International Energy Agency, global coal consumption reached a new high in 2022 even though the increase has been expected to be temporary. Global coal consumption in 2022 exceeded 8 billion tonnes in 2022, which was a boon to some of the largest coal mining companies in USA. Hallador Energy Company (NASDAQ:HNRG) saw 1 year returns of 72.2%, CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE:CEIX) saw a one year share price increase of 31% and Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ:ARLP) saw a return of 30.7% in the same time period, just to give a few examples of how coal companies profited in 2022.As mentioned earlier, this boon is expected to be temporary, and the World Bank has stated that coal prices are expected to decline in the medium term but prices are still much higher than the 2017 - 2021 average. China and India led record global consumption while exports were increased by Colombia and South Africa. Meanwhile, in Australia and South Africa, benchmark coal prices fell by around 50% from peaks earned in September 2022 and April 2022 respectively. Coal future prices have also declined considerably in 2023 as compared to 2022 but if gas prices rise further in 2023, this could create more demand for coal and hence, lead to a price increase there. Further risks to the coal industry include global growth falling below forecasts and China's economic revitalization after its abandonment of the nation's zero-Covid policy fails to materialize. One of the largest coal mining companies in the USA, Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) mentioned in its Q4 2022 earnings call ""So for 2023, we have a solid sales book, as we stated. We are completely sold out both in the PRB and our other U.S. thermal mines. So we have a really strong hand there. And so far, the shipments have been going. The nominations have been there and the demand has been there. Our customers, particularly our PRB customers are still short of their target inventories even though they're burning less coal are still short of their inventory. So the demand is there. The challenge we're having is with rail service in the PRB, which was a challenge we had last year and has continued into the start of this year, still with crew shortages, but also there's been some tough weather in the PRB. We are expecting to see that turn around here in the coming months, both railroads have additional crews coming on in February this month. So we're expecting to see some improvements in the rail performance. And at the moment, that really, Lucas, is nothing that I would say that we're seeing from the customer side. It's more of a transportation issue, which is a carryover from last year.""The top two largest coal mining companies in the USA alone account for over 30% of all production in the country. To calculate our ranking, we have considered their coal production in 2021 based on data from the International Energy Agency, and market cap as at 20th April 2023, with data taken from Yahoo Finance.

(O) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this real estate investment trust have returned +4.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks REIT and Equity Trust - Retail industry, to which Realty Income Corp. belongs, has gained 2.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Realty Income Corp. is expected to post earnings of $1.01 per share, indicating a change of +3.1% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.7% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.10 points to a change of +4.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.26 indicates a change of +3.8% from what Realty Income Corp. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Realty Income Corp.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for O _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Realty Income Corp. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $899.87 million indicates a year-over-year change of +11.5%. For the current and next fiscal years, $3.68 billion and $3.9 billion estimates indicate +10.1% and +6.1% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryRealty Income Corp. reported revenues of $888.65 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +29.7%. EPS of $0.36 for the same period compares with $0.94 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $853.29 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.14%. The EPS surprise was +2.04%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Realty Income Corp. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Realty Income Corp. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

For the week, WTI was down 5.5%, snapping a four-week rally heightened by this month's production maneuver by OPEC+ that had brought a net gain of 24%.London-traded Brent, the global benchmark for crude, was up 53 cents, or 0.7%, to $81.63 by 14:40 ET (18:40 GMT). For the week, Brent was also down 5.5% like WTI. Its prior four-week rally had contributed a cumulative gain of 18%.The dollar’s rebound earlier this week from the one-year lows hit last week was the catalyst to the change in the fortunes of those long oil. A higher dollar weighs on overseas demand for commodities priced in the currency. Higher U.S. Treasury yields sap the appeal of risk-heavy assets, while also limiting flows of foreign capital.Then news of job layoffs by major corporations operating in the United States reinforced fears of business slowdowns and an impending recession.Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) said it intended to retrench 4,000 workers by June despite a sterling first quarter. Big Four accounting firms announced their own layoffs, with Ernst&amp;Young saying it will shed 5% of its U.S. workforce while Deloitte said it will cut 1.5%.On the media front, Buzzfeed said the online publication would be shut down while Insider Inc — formerly known as Business Insider — announced it would begin cutting an estimated 10% of its staff in an effort to stay “healthy and competitive”.Riding over those job cuts were worries that the Federal Reserve will agree on another quarter point increase at its May 3rd rate decision which will bring U.S. interest rates to a peak of 5.25% — versus the pandemic-era rate of just 0.25%.A mixed weekly picture for U.S. oil demand also weighed on the market.Story continuesThe crude balance  in storage fell by 4.581 million barrels during the week ended April 14, EIA reported. In the previous week to April 7, crude stockpiles rose by 0.597M barrels. Industry analysts tracked by Investing.comhad expected the EIA to report a crude balance decline of just 1.088M barrels for last week.But on gasoline inventory front, the EIA cited a build of 1.3M barrels versus the forecast drop of 1.267M barrels, and against the previous weekly decline of 0.331M. Automotive fuel gasoline is the No. 1 U.S. fuel product.In terms of product supplied to the market — a clear indicator of end-user demand — finished motor gasoline filled 8.519M barrels last week, down 416,000 barrels from the April 14 tally of 8.936M.With distillate stockpiles, the EIA reported a 0.356M barrel draw, against expectations for a drop of 0.927M barrels and versus the prior week's consumption of 0.606M. Distillates are refined into heating oil, diesel for trucks, buses, trains and ships, and fuel for jets.Just a week ago, oil prices hit their highest levels since November, with WTI reaching $83.53 and Brent rallying to $87.49, extending a run-up that began on April 3 after a production maneuver by OPEC+ to lift a market that had hit 15-month lows in March on global financial worries.OPEC+, which groups the 13-member Saudi-led Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with 10 independent oil producers, including Russia, said it will cut a further 1.7M barrels from its daily output, adding to an earlier pledge from November to take off 2.0M barrels per day.OPEC+, however, has a history of over-promising and under-delivering on production cuts. While the group achieved over-compliance on promised cuts in the aftermath of the 2020 coronavirus breakout, experts say that was more a result of battered demand that led to minimal production, rather than a will to cut barrels as pledged.“OPEC+ pre-emptive action may have been taken on accurate assumptions on the economy and demand and will not propel the price back above $100,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at online trading platform OANDA.Related ArticlesOil down 5% on week as U.S. rate hike fears, job cuts defy OPEC+Oil rises but set for weekly loss as economic uncertainty weighsGold below $2,000 in second straight weekly loss]"

An upward trend in earnings estimates -- one of the most powerful forces impacting stock prices -- has triggered this rating change.The Zacks rating relies solely on a company's changing earnings picture. It tracks EPS estimates for the current and following years from the sell-side analysts covering the stock through a consensus measure -- the Zacks Consensus Estimate.The power of a changing earnings picture in determining near-term stock price movements makes the Zacks rating system highly useful for individual investors, since it can be difficult to make decisions based on rating upgrades by Wall Street analysts. These are mostly driven by subjective factors that are hard to see and measure in real time.Therefore, the Zacks rating upgrade for Omnicom basically reflects positivity about its earnings outlook that could translate into buying pressure and an increase in its stock price.Most Powerful Force Impacting Stock PricesThe change in a company's future earnings potential, as reflected in earnings estimate revisions, and the near-term price movement of its stock are proven to be strongly correlated. The influence of institutional investors has a partial contribution to this relationship, as these big professionals use earnings and earnings estimates to calculate the fair value of a company's shares. An increase or decrease in earnings estimates in their valuation models simply results in higher or lower fair value for a stock, and institutional investors typically buy or sell it. Their bulk investment action then leads to price movement for the stock.For Omnicom, rising earnings estimates and the consequent rating upgrade fundamentally mean an improvement in the company's underlying business. And investors' appreciation of this improving business trend should push the stock higher.Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate RevisionsEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock movements, so it could be truly rewarding if such revisions are tracked for making an investment decision. Here is where the tried-and-tested Zacks Rank stock-rating system plays an important role, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions.Story continuesThe Zacks Rank stock-rating system, which uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive externally-audited track record, with Zacks Rank #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

Over the past three months, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company has increased 16.5%.Bottom LineUnlike the overly optimistic Wall Street analysts whose rating systems tend to be weighted toward favorable recommendations, the Zacks rating system maintains an equal proportion of 'buy' and 'sell' ratings for its entire universe of more than 4000 stocks at any point in time. Irrespective of market conditions, only the top 5% of the Zacks-covered stocks get a 'Strong Buy' rating and the next 15% get a 'Buy' rating.

39,2af78a3a-d50b-3cbc-801d-272f66574186,FE,2023-04-22,How the Clean Air Act lets closed coal plants keep polluting for years,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-clean-air-act-lets-110921519.html,1682161761,STORY,['FE'],"[By Tim McLaughlin(Reuters) - Hatfield’s Ferry Power Station, a Pennsylvania coal-fired power plant, stopped producing electricity in 2013. Its closure came in a wave of coal-plant shutdowns triggered by competition from cheaper, cleaner natural gas and incentives in the U.S. Clean Air Act.But the facility’s legacy of smog pollution continued long after it closed.That’s because a loophole in clean-air regulations allowed Hatfield’s Ferry to collect emissions allowances under a cap-and-trade program for five years after it shut down. The plant’s owner then sold those credits to other plants, which can use them to stay in compliance when they exceed their own regulatory budget of allowances. Among the beneficiaries: the biggest emitter of smog-causing gas in America’s power sector.Under the federal program, states distribute a certain number of allowances to power plants annually. Each one permits one ton of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. NOx contributes to smog, which causes respiratory problems and premature death.If a plant doesn’t use all of its allowances, it can sell them to other plants. The credits are valuable because they can provide plants a cheaper alternative to buying and operating hugely expensive pollution-control equipment.The provision grants closing plants a credit windfall: They can sell all of their allowances because they are no longer generating smog themselves.A Reuters review of federal data shows the owner of Hatfield’s Ferry, FirstEnergy Corp, sold most of the credits it received after closing the plant or transferred them to other FirstEnergy-owned facilities. One batch, worth an estimated $1.2 million, helped Missouri’s New Madrid Power Plant in 2021 comply with emission regulations while generating the most smog-producing NOx in the nation. Reuters found dozens of other examples of coal plants using credits from closed facilities to help comply with pollution rules over the past five years.Story continuesFirstEnergy Corp declined to comment.As the climate-change fight intensifies, governments worldwide have struggled to phase-out coal, among the dirtiest fossil fuels, without harming reliability and affordability of electricity. That issue and other environmental challenges are getting heightened attention today, April 22, on International Earth Day.The issue highlights an unintended consequence of the U.S. EPA’s latest revision of the Cross-State Pollution Rule (CSAPR), first enacted in 2011 as a provision of the Clean Air Act. The measure is aimed at cutting air pollution from upwind states that harms air quality in downwind states.The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) last month moved to reduce the impact of closed-plant allowances by reducing the number of years a retired facility can collect them from five to two. But the previous policy had already injected the market with a huge volume of credits that will take years to work their way through the system: Between 2017 and 2020, for instance, the ratio of allowances available to comply with NOx-pollution regulations during the peak ozone season surged. In 2020, there were 2.5 allowances available for every ton of NOx pollution emitted by plants in the cap-and-trade program, compared to 1.5 allowances per ton in 2017, EPA disclosures show.Retired-plant allowances fueled the liquidity. In 2020, about 20% of the 585,000 allowances available to cover 232,000 tons of emissions were from power plants that had retired at least one coal-fired unit in the past decade, federal data show.The power sector lobbied last year to keep the closed-plant credits flowing, according to letters sent to the EPA by utilities and electric cooperatives.Associated Electric Cooperative Inc (AECI), the New Madrid plant’s owner, said in a statement that it was cheaper to buy allowances than run the facility’s pollution controls. “This is the EPA’s cap-and-trade allowance program working as designed,” AECI said.CREDIT ‘GLUT’But the program wasn’t working as the EPA intended. In 2021, the agency reduced allowances for power plants in 12 states to curb an oversupply in the NOx-credit market, according to rule changes published by the EPA.The EPA took several more steps last month to reduce what it has described as a credit “glut,” the agency explained in a document detailing the changes. The problem: The oversupply depressed credit prices, encouraging plant owners to idle their pollution controls and use cheap credits for compliance, according to the document.In response to questions from Reuters, the EPA said the credits for closed plants had no effect on the total number of credits given to all U.S. plants or the nation’s overall coal pollution. Overall pollution is capped, the agency said, by “the total volume of available allowances each ozone season and other design components.”The EPA did not answer questions about why it continues to grant retired-facility allowances at all and why it chose to shorten the time frame.The agency, however, said in disclosures explaining this year’s policy changes that the cheap-credit glut contributed to a surge in emissions at coal plants that have advanced pollution controls between 2017 and 2020. Constellation Energy Corp, which generates electricity from renewable sources and oil-fired power plants, blamed allocations to retired plants in a June 2022 letter to the EPA: “Continuing to allocate allowances to a retired unit inappropriately saturates the allowance market, deterring emissions reductions.”The issue persisted last year, EPA data show, when a third of the 121 coal plants with the most advanced pollution controls produced NOx above what the agency calls an optimal level.The EPA has long maintained that the retired-plant credits incentivize owners to close inefficient facilities. But now, with abundant government and market incentives to produce renewable energy, the extra credits will have minimal influence on shutdown decisions, the EPA said in its finalized March rule.Elena Krieger, who oversees scientific research at PSE Healthy Energy, a California-based policy institute, was shocked when she learned about the retired-plant credits. She fears that trading of these allowances enables active plants to boost NOx emissions, harming public health in nearby and downwind communities.“I was unaware of the practice and am somewhat horrified,” Krieger said.DIRTY DEALSIn its 2021 deal, Hatfield’s Ferry traded more than 5,000 allowances to New Madrid’s owner, AECI, according to EPA transaction data. The sale terms were not disclosed, but NOx allowances traded at about $225 per ton at the time, according to S&amp;P Global’s Market Intelligence.That’s a bargain for coal plants with the most advanced pollution controls, which would otherwise spend $900 to $1,600 to remove a ton of NOx with their equipment, according to EPA estimates.New Madrid cut back its pollution controls and chuffed out NOx at a high rate during that period, using credits to maintain compliance. During the 2021 ozone season, New Madrid’s pollution was five times higher than average among coal plants participating in the NOx-reduction program, EPA data show. Over the past five years, New Madrid has produced more NOx than any other U.S. power plant.AECI said advanced NOx-pollution controls such as selective catalytic reduction (SCR) can limit a plant’s electricity production. The cooperative acknowledged it has taken New Madrid’s SCR offline to boost output, which it argues improves grid stability.The New Madrid plant appears to be taking steps to reduce pollution. AECI agreed with Missouri regulators in October 2022 to operate its SCR pollution controls at least 95% of the time during the peak-ozone season, extending from May 1 to Sept. 30. The EPA is reviewing the agreement for approval.Still, AECI contends federal regulators are moving too fast in the renewable-energy transition. The company told Reuters the hurried transition comes “at the expense of stable and reliable electricity” with potentially “very serious consequences” during severe-weather power outages.RED-STATE PROTESTSUtilities and lawmakers in Republican-controlled states have pushed hard against curbs on coal pollution, including the EPA’s latest NOx-reduction regulations.“We remain concerned the rule will cause a large number of premature coal retirements that will increase the risk of electricity shortages,” said Michelle Bloodworth, CEO of America’s Power, a coal-industry trade group.Ken Ivory, a Republican state lawmaker in Utah, told Reuters: “It really is just mind-numbing that the biggest obstacle to reliable electricity in our state is our federal government.”The EPA’s latest update to cross-state emissions regulations, dubbed the Good Neighbor rule, caps the annual percentage of allowances that can be banked for future use in each state at 21%, another measure aimed at gutting the pollution-credit glut.That and other policy changes have sparked a massive increase in allowance prices, which are now running at about $10,000 apiece, according to Roman Kramarchuk, head of future energy outlooks at S&amp;P Global Commodity Insights.But even at that price, NOx allowances will find buyers among coal plants, including those that operate at high pollution rates. When natural gas and wholesale power prices spike, some plants can still make money with allowance prices above $30,000, according to S&amp;P.(Reporting by Tim McLaughlin; editing by Richard Valdmanis and Brian Thevenot)]"

42,a63afefc-508b-3e0c-8ca2-92e73dc686b7,CRM,2023-04-22,Top 15 Cloud Computing Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-15-cloud-computing-companies-202451124.html,1682108691,STORY,"['AMZN', 'CRM', 'DBX', 'NVDA', 'WDAY', 'IOT', 'IBM', 'NOW', 'SPLK', 'ADSK', 'VMW', 'VEEV', 'ADP', 'TEAM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the top 15 cloud computing companies in the world. For more companies head on over to Top 5 Cloud Computing Companies in the World. The growth of technology has created new markets and changed the manner in which people live their lives and businesses run their operations. While the computer and the microprocessor on their own have enabled users to compute billions of instructions in the blink of an eye, the true disruption from technology takes place in tandem with the rise of the Internet. Data from the popular internet speed testing firm Ookla, global internet speeds have grown from 0.5 megabits per second (Mbps) to 107 Mbps as of July 2021.This high speed connectivity has generated growth in a relatively nascent industry called cloud computing. The Internet's role in cloud computing growth is clear from the fact that these technologies have been present since the 1970s when computers were first linked together to allow for resource sharing. This also led to a growth in enterprise resource computing and firms such as SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) which enable companies to manage their production and other resources efficiently. However, things only took a head at the turn of the millennia, with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) allowing its customers to 'rent out' cloud computing resources and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) delivering software over the Internet. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) joined in soon as it provided a system for developers to develop applications over the Internet, and even the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) pitched in by providing the world's first open source software for creating private and semi private cloud computing networks.These days, cloud computing is used far and wide in both the enterprise sector and by the general consumer. One of the most well known examples of cloud computing is Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX)'s online platform that enables users to remotely share their documents and other resources. While on the surface Dropbox being a cloud computing firm might sound counterintuitive due to the term 'computing', in fact, cloud computing is defined by three distinct yet interrelated services. These are platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). Out of these, Dropbox is a SaaS company since it provides people with access to a virtual platform located on its hardware through an easily accessible interface.Story continuesOn the corporate side of things, cloud computing is quite prevalent as well. These uses are spread across a variety of industries, from sectors ranging from hospitality and restaurants to biotechnology, banking, and production and logistics optimization. According to the consulting firm McKinsey, the coronavirus pandemic was a massive stimulant for the cloud computing sector. It outlines that prior to the devastating global pandemic, companies planned to spend less than half of their information technology budgets on cloud computing by 2021. However, the pandemic led to this spending growing to 80% of the budget by 2024. A large motivating factor behind this spending is the cost benefits offered by cloud computing, as according to McKinsey, the segment can generate an additional $1 trillion in operating income. For the uninitiated, operating income is the income of a firm after direct and indirect costs are accounted for but taxes and interest payments are not subtracted. On a side note, cloud computing was also central in Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s fight against the coronavirus, as the firm built its messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) research platform on a public cloud, which enabled it to scale up research of, and rapidly design, the Spikevax coronavirus vaccine.As a whole, the global cloud computing market was worth $484 billion in 2022 and should grow to $619 billion by the end of this year according to a report from Grand View Research. From then until 2030, the sector is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1% and sit at a final value of $1.5 trillion by the end of the forecast period.Looking at the situation on the ground, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s chief financial officer Mr. Brian Olsavsky commented on the firm's AWS cloud computing division during Amazon's Q4 2022 earnings call conference where he highlighted:Net sales increased $21.4 billion in Q4, up 20% year-over-year and now representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Starting back in the middle of the third quarter of 2022, we saw our year-over-year growth rates slow as enterprises of all sizes evaluated ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to the tough macroeconomic conditions.As expected, these optimization efforts continued into the fourth quarter. Some of the key benefits of being in the cloud compared to managing your own data center are the ability to handle large demand swings and to optimize costs relatively quickly, especially during times of economic uncertainty. Our customers are looking for ways to save money, and we spend a lot of our time trying to help them do so. This customer focus is in our DNA and informs how we think about our customer relationships and how we will partner with them for the long term. As we look ahead, we expect these optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters. So far in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-teens.That said, stepping back, our new customer pipeline remains healthy and robust, and there are many customers continuing to put plans in place to migrate to the cloud and commit to AWS over the long term.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the top cloud computing companies in the world, with the top ones being Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL).Top 15 Cloud Computing Companies in the WorldAI Generated ImageOur Methodology To find the top cloud computing companies in the world, we started by listing down all publicly traded firms that provide cloud computing products and services.

The technology-laden Nasdaq index has gained 17% year to date. With a recovery underway, now looks like an opportune time for investors to wade back into high-growth stocks, while also looking for companies with attractive valuations.There happen to be many high-growth stocks that can be purchased right now at attractive prices and valuations. Indeed, I think the majority of gains for many of these high-growth stocks could be in the coming years.That’s partially due to investor positioning favoring defensive stocks right now. Should investors rotate back into a more balanced investment mix, these high-growth stocks could really take off in the next bull market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, without further ado, here are seven high-growth stocks that could make you a fortune, if you get in now.CMGChipotle Mexican Grill$1,800AIC3.AI$20.06INTUIntuit$446.40RACEFerrari$278.03CRMSalesforce$199.03METAMeta Platforms$212.89MSFTMicrosoft$285.76Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG)a pedestrian walks past a ChipotleSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comShares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) continue to outperform. In 2023, CMG stock has increased 30%. Since the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020, the company’s share price has nearly tripled. Indeed, No matter what headwinds crop up, Chipotle seems ready and able to weather the storm and come out stronger on the other side. The company’s growth has continued unabated, with Chipotle’s management team recently announcing plans to open 285 new locations and hire 15,000 workers this year.While many restaurant chains have struggled to win back customers coming out of the pandemic, Chipotle hasn’t missed a beat. The company’s strong performance has led to a number of analyst upgrades and bullish predictions about CMG stock. U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently labeled CMG stock a “strong buy,” saying in a note to clients that “We continue to view Chipotle as one of the most compelling growth stocks.”Story continuesC3.ai (AI)AI stocks an intelligent robot figure representing ai stocks, investing for the next decadeSource: ShutterstockWhen it comes to technology, artificial intelligence is the hot sector this year. And among AI stocks, none is hotter right now than C3.ai (NYSE:AI).So far this year, AI stock is up 105%, driven almost entirely by the hype surrounding generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT. The good news for investors is that despite the big year-to-date run, C3.ai’s stock still trades for less than $25 per share, making it affordable for most investors.To be fair, the short interest in AI stock has grown dramatically in recent months, with a quarter (25%) of the company’s stock now sold short. There are rumblings on message boards such as r/WallStreetBets that a major short squeeze is brewing for the stock.That said, there’s also a fundamental thesis supporting this rise. C3.ai has reported strong quarterly earnings and its stock has continued to rise despite a growing chorus of naysayers predicting it will decline.In my view, long-term buy and hold investors might want to get in on the ground floor with this stock.Intuit (INTU)Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU), the software company behind TurboTax, QuickBooks, and Credit Karma, has been on a roll this year, with its stock gaining 13% since the first trading day in January. Over the past five years, INTU stock has risen nearly 150%.Businesses and consumers alike are fans of Intuit’s products, which help them with their finances. This has made the company’s stock a winning investment. Helping matters, Intuit has consistently reported better-than-expected earnings.While Intuit isn’t as well-known or widely-covered as other tech companies or software developers, it has provided great returns to investors who have stuck with it over the years. Despite being around since 1983, Intuit continues to boast impressive growth. In its most recent quarter, Intuit reported that its earnings per share grew 42% from a year earlier. Analysts, on average, forecast that Intuit’s earnings per share will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% over the next five years.Ferrari (RACE)A photo of the Ferrari logo on a red bannerSource: ShutterstockShares of Italian luxury racecar manufacturer Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) look ready to shift into overdrive. Since the start of the year, RACE stock has sped ahead by 30%. This at a time when more traditional automakers such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (ETR:VOW3) are limping along with their stock up only about 5% on the year. The keys to Ferrari’s success have been robust sales and strong margins.Ferrari reported record earnings in 2022, and a strong backlog of orders indicates that the luxury automaker may do even better this year. Additionally, Ferrari is embracing fully electric and hybrid model sports cars, promising that they will comprise 80% of its annual sales by 2030.Despite the transition to EVs, Ferrari is assuring investors that it will remain in growth mode, forecasting that its earnings will grow by a compound annual growth rate of 9% through decade’s end.Salesforce (CRM)The entrance sign of Salesforce Tower, at the American cloud-based software company Salesforce's (CRM stock) Headquarters campus in San Francisco, California.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comThings are looking up for Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). Among the world’s largest cloud computing companies, Salesforce has seen its stock rise 47% this year, making it a top performer in 2023. The gain is welcome news for shareholders who have had to watch Salesforce, which specializes in customer relationship management software, struggle over the last year with a number of problems that led to a cratering share price.Specifically, Salesforce was targeted by several activist investors and saw the departure of multiple top executives. The turmoil pushed CRM stock down 60% between November 2021 and December 2022.Fortunately, the company is now on the mend, with its stock jumping 16% in one day after it delivered better-than-expected earnings and issued strong forward guidance. Salesforce also announced that it is doubling its stock buyback program to $20 billion from $10 billion previously. Music to investors’ ears.Meta Platforms (META)Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.Source: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.comSpeaking of tech stocks that are rebounding, how about Facebook parent company Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)?This year, META stock has risen 75%. The share price is now back above $200 and a new 52-week high looks close at hand. Sentiment towards the company run by Mark Zuckerberg has improved dramatically since the company scaled back its investments in the metaverse and undertook company-wide cost cutting initiatives.Meta Platforms has managed to win back investors’ trust with aggressive spending cuts that have included laying off more than 20,000 employees. Zuckerberg has labeled 2023 the “year of efficiency.” Meta Platforms has also announced a $40 billion stock buyback program, which has helped to lift its share price. Additionally, META stock is also benefitting from the company’s forays into A.I. and government threats to ban Chinese social media app TikTok.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a lot going for it right now. The company is arguably the biggest winner so far in the artificial intelligence race. Executives at the tech giant had the foresight to invest $10 billion into privately held OpenAI,  a move that has enabled Microsoft to integrate the powerful ChatGPT AI system into its Bing search engine. Now, recent headlines have piqued investor interest in the stock once again, as Samsung is reportedly considering making Bing the default web browser on its smartphones, laptops and other electronic devices, replacing Google.If that weren’t enough, Microsoft is nearing the finish line on its $68 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), which seems increasingly-likely to be approved by regulators in the coming months. The Activision purchase will bolster Microsoft’s already impressive library of exclusive game titles that includes Halo and Forza Motorsport. The company is now talking about the potential of AI to enhance its video game offerings. MSFT stock has gained 20% since January.On the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in GM and MSFT.

IDXX is set to release first-quarter 2023 results on May 2 before the opening bell.The company posted adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $2.05 in the last reported quarter, which surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 6.77%. IDEXX Laboratories beat earnings estimates in all the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 3.59%.Let’s look at how things have shaped up before this announcement.Factors at PlayThe Companion Animal Group (“CAG”) business of IDEXX is expected to have gained from consistent organic growth in CAG Diagnostics’ recurring revenues, backed by growth in clinical service demand and the expanded utilization of diagnostic products and services across geographies.The benefits of IDEXX’s key execution drivers, including the expansion of the CAG premium instrument base, sustained high customer retention levels and the expansion of diagnostics revenues per visit supported by higher price realization, are likely to have generated substantial CAG Diagnostics’ recurring revenues in the first quarter.IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIDEXX Laboratories, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseIDEXX Laboratories, Inc. price-eps-surprise | IDEXX Laboratories, Inc. QuoteIn the prior quarter, consumable gains were supported by solid year-over-year growth in IDEXX’s global premium instrument installed base. This reflected double-digit gains across the Catalyst, Premium Hematology and SediVue platforms.The company placed more than 5000 CAG premium instruments in the fourth quarter of 2022. Strong customer interests in IDEXX’s premium hematology analyzer, ProCyte One, and global expansion efforts in premium hematology placements are likely to have benefited the company’s CAG arm in the first quarter.Revenues from veterinary software and diagnostic imaging systems, including the benefits of the ezyVet acquisition, are likely to have been advantageous for the business in the to-be-reported quarter. IDEXX’s veterinary software is also expected to report strong growth in the first quarter, supported by gains from recurring software and continued strong momentum in cloud-based software placements.Story continuesRecently, IDEXX Laboratories made a significant development. In January 2023, IDEXX added a canine cancer screening test to its advanced preventive care solutions, to help veterinary professionals in the early detection of life-threatening diseases and improve patient outcomes. We expect that this development is likely to have aided the company’s top line in the first quarter.In February, IDXX announced a first-of-its-kind empirical study featuring 786 participants, aimed to discover effective actions veterinary practices can take to increase productivity. The publication titled “Finding the Time: Empowering Veterinary Teams to Get the Most Out of Every Day” provided strategies for creating additional capacity amid staffing constraints, depending on where a practice falls on IDEXX’s Practice Productivity Index.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for CAG revenues is pegged at $804 million, suggesting an improvement of 7.3% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Meanwhile, IDEXX’s Water business is likely to have delivered an impressive revenue performance on price improvements and solid volume gains for compliance and non-compliance testing. The business is expected to have benefited from a continued increase in water testing demand worldwide as economies gradually recover from the severity of the pandemic.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Water revenues is pegged at $38.9 million, suggesting a fall of 0.8% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Within the Livestock, Poultry and Dairy (“LPD”) arm, we expect first-quarter revenues to have been positively impacted by increasing herd health screening and improved performance in China compared to the normalized levels of African Swine Fever and core Swine testing.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LPD revenues is pegged at $31.0 million, implying a drop of 6.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Q1 EstimatesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for IDEXX Laboratories’ first-quarter 2023 revenues is pegged at $888 million, suggesting an increase of 6.2% from the year-ago reported figure.The consensus estimate for its first-quarter 2023 EPS of $2.39 indicates a 5.3% rise from the year-ago reported figure.What Our Model SuggestsPer our proven model, a stock with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold), along with a positive Earnings ESP, has a higher chance of beating estimates.

Next week will be the first big week of this reporting cycle as more than 1,000 companies are slated to announce their financial numbers. Five U.S. corporate giants with a favorable Zacks Rank are poised to beat on earnings next week.Early-Stage Q1 ResultsMarket participants will try to analyze this reporting cycle against the backdrop of a possible recession later this year. Therefore, this season, management guidance and the near-term business outlook will get more importance than actual results. In addition to earnings and revenues, margins will get more attention from financial researchers.As of Apr 19, 53 companies on the S&amp;P 500 Index have reported their quarterly financial numbers. Total earnings of these companies are up 2.9% year over year on 9.3% higher revenues. Moreover, 83% of companies have surpassed earnings estimates while 71.7% have beaten revenue estimates.Better-Than-Expected Start to Q1 EarningsAs of Apr 19, our projection has shown that total earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index are set to decline 8.8% year over year on 2.1% higher revenues compared with a 10% year-over-year decline in earnings on 1.7% higher revenues, estimated at the beginning of the reporting cycle. This will follow a 5.4% year-over-year decline in earnings of the S&amp;P 500 Index on 5.9% higher revenues in fourth-quarter 2022.This earnings season is likely to witness the fifth consecutive quarter of a year-over-year decline in net margins of the S&amp;P 500 Index. The aggregate net margin is likely to decline 1.47% in the first quarter. If this happens, it will mark the biggest quarterly decline since the 1.38% year-over-year net margin decline in fourth-quarter 2022.Our Top PicksWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate bigwigs that are set to report first-quarter 2023 earnings results next week. Each of these stocks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and has a positive Earnings ESP.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Juniper Networks has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Motorola has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that JNPR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.JNPR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.63, while MSI has a forward P/E of 25.73. We also note that JNPR has a PEG ratio of 1.96. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. MSI currently has a PEG ratio of 2.86.Another notable valuation metric for JNPR is its P/B ratio of 2.24. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MSI has a P/B of 367.23.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to JNPR's Value grade of B and MSI's Value grade of C.JNPR stands above MSI thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that JNPR is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Those three things are essentially called metadata.Yahoo Finance’s Brad Smith explains when metadata actually comes into play for social media companies and what they do with your data.Video Transcript- Siri, what is metadata?BRAD SMITH: So you want to know about metadata? Of course you do. It's come up in a lot of conversations, especially around some of the social media hearings that have taken place on Capitol Hill.So what is metadata? Metadata is essentially the data about data. And to break that down even further, say you post a picture. That picture, even when you've taken it, already has the location that that picture was taken at, the date that it was taken, the type of camera that you were probably using. Those three things and more amass the metadata.But here's where it comes into play for some of the social media companies, is because when you post that image, you are essentially giving that metadata over to the social media companies. And you're allowing them to then catalog some of that metadata and create an advertising profile on you that they can then index and be able to resell to other advertisers. So for social media companies, that metadata is incredibly important.There's some data that you volunteer when you sign up for a profile. But there's other data that you're giving them, not even knowing it. And that is how you get advertised to on such a granular level and why some of those ads are so relevant.

Wall Street might not remain calm with Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon all reporting during the week of April 24. The question now is should investors buy these resurgent mega-cap tech stocks heading into earnings, or wait?Tesla’s 10% fall on Thursday seemed like it could have sparked a bigger move, but the S&amp;P 500 only managed to drop 0.6% after buyers came in late in the session. Prior to the tiny drop, the market remained nearly stagnant during the early part of the week as Wall Street simply sits on its hands, which is what it did Friday. The calmness amid the first busy week of earnings could mean that investors are far more focused on the next few inflation reports and what the Fed does. It is also possible that Wall Street is waiting for something exceedingly spooky or very bullish from a few key reports in order to make a move.Thankfully, Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, and many other heavyweights all report next week and should help investors understand if the subdued trading will remain until the next Fed meeting on May 2 &amp; 3 and the April CPI report on May 10.It is worth constantly remembering that the Nasdaq and the S&amp;P 500 have both moved roughly sideways over the last few months, while remaining well above both their 50-day and 200-day moving averages. Investors now need to ask themselves if the worst is already priced into big tech.Microsoft (MSFT) is set to report its Q3 FY23 results on Tuesday, April 25. MSFT has mounted a comeback off its lows, but it remains about 18% below its highs as investors assess how long its slowing growth will last. Microsoft is coming off five-straight years of booming sales and earnings growth, driven by cloud computing.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMSFT’s near-term outlook still calls for growth, followed by a big rebound in FY24 as it proves its diversified portfolio, from cloud to business software, is too mission-critical to the economy to be held down for too long. Microsoft is diving headfirst into generative AI and it is a cash cow with nearly $100 billion in cash and equivalents. MSFT, which lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now, is up around 20% YTD and trades not too far off its five-year median at 27.5X forward 12-month earnings.Story continuesMeta Platforms, Inc. (META) reports its Q1 FY23 results on Wednesday, April 26. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp reaches 2.96 billion people daily and 3.74 billion monthly, which is something advertisers and marketers simply cannot ignore even though Apple’s privacy changes have hurt the entire industry. Meta shares have rocketed over 130% since early November as it commits to cutting costs, profitably, and its core businesses instead of the metaverse.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchZacks estimates call for Meta’s 2023 revenue to climb 5% and pop 11% in FY24 to $135 billion. Meanwhile, Meta’s adjusted earnings are projected to jump 4% in FY23 and 21% FY24. Meta’s surging earnings revisions help it land a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Despite its 135% climb off its lows it still trades almost 45% beneath its peaks. And Meta is trading at discount to the Zacks Tech sector’s 22.8X at 19.4X forward 12-month earnings.Amazon (AMZN) reports its first quarter FY23 results on Thursday, April 27. Amazon’s fall was almost as brutal as Meta’s as the e-commerce and cloud giant got hammered on concerns about profitability and slowing growth. CEO Andy Jassy is in the midst of trying to tame rampant spending and cutting costs, while still investing in its own generative AI models and other key efforts. Amazon’s growth is no doubt slowing, but it’s still projected to post 8% sales growth in 2023 and 13% in 2024 and boost its bottom line by 90% and 60%, respectively.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAmazon lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now and it trades roughly 40% below its highs and around where it was directly prior to the initial covid selloff. Its valuations levels are still far from cheap, but they should continue to improve as it focuses on running its business like a more stable firm and not a growth-at-all-costs upstart.

To see more such stocks click 5 Best Humane Stocks to Buy Now.There isn't a clear definition of the concept of humane business, primarily because it is an emerging theme in corporate culture. However, the concept can be understood as a way of doing business that cares for humanity (i.e., respects human freedom, well-being, and dignity) and has concern for the Earth (i.e., focuses on environmental conservation).In a prior piece, we delved deeply into ESG investing and its potential to enable investors to make a positive impact on the world. However, there is another angle of human business activity that one can argue is a subset of ESG — it involves companies that do not test on animals.The inhumane practice of animal testing for diverse reasons is widespread in the global corporate culture. We noted that cosmetics and medical research companies are the worst offenders. In fact, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), a nonprofit, tax-exempt 501(c)(3) corporation, lists more than 200 companies that do tests on animals. Interestingly, an overwhelming majority are beauty and fashion and pharmaceutical companies.According to a PwC report, ESG investing – investing activity that focuses on environmental, social and governance factors – is growing exponentially in global markets. The report estimates that ESG investing will reach $33.9 trillion by 2026. In other words, 21.5% of total assets under management in 2026 will be invested in ESG-focused businesses.ESG investing involves seeking out humane companies that do not conduct animal testing. Thankfully, PETA also lists the companies that do not test on animals, making it easy for investors to make the right choice. In addition, many other publicly traded corporations are strong defenders of animal rights, making them humane by association. For example, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is not only on the PETA ‘safe list’ but is also actively involved in animal welfare advocacy. Accenture Plc (NYSE:ACN) is another major corporation that does well regarding ESG. In this regard, this article intends to provide investors with a list of 10 best humane stocks to buy now.Story continuesPhoto by Karlo Tottoc on UnsplashOur MethodologyFor this article we focused more on companies that avoid any tests on animals, are working to reduce carbon footprint and have ethical practices and standards. Our research started with a thorough analysis of the PETA ‘safe list’ – these are the companies that have been ascertained to not be involved in any form of animal cruelty. To ensure the list provides a more accurate representation of humane stocks in the US, we expanded our research to The Food Service Industry Protein Sustainability Scorecard, an index maintained by The Humane Society of the United States. We also read social media posts and forum discussions extensively to ensure we select the best humane companies. From the long list of companies we got after our research, we narrowed down to 10 companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors.Best Humane Stocks to Buy Now10.

(NASDAQ:INGN), a medical device company that manufactures portable oxygen concentrators for patients with breathing issues, is a market leader, but like Advanced Energy, is constrained by chip supply, so it is dramatically under-earning versus the demand it is seeing for its products. We believe Inogen is trading at only 16 times next year's adjusted cash flow (at lower-than-normal margins), and it is trading at only 2 times our out year cash flow estimates. Again, this is a potential multi-bagger investment over our longer-term investment horizon.Another reason we are excited about the portfolio going forward is that we have been taking advantage of the current market dislocation to upgrade the quality of the portfolio. During the past two quarters, we have been able to purchase quality companies that were previously out of our reach due to market capitalization limitations. Because the whole market sold off to such a great extent, there were some high-quality “babies” that got thrown out with the “bathwater.” Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Humane Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested articles: 10 Best Music Stocks to Buy Now12 Best Energy Stocks To Invest In According to Analysts10 Best Edge Computing Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure: None. 10 Best Humane Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

The index is up around 7.5% year-to-date.Whether that rally continues could depend on companies beating already-lowered first-quarter estimates. Technology earnings are seen falling 14.4%. Communication services companies, including Meta Platforms Inc and Alphabet Inc, are expected to post declines of 12%, according to Refinitiv data.After steep declines in 2022, ""this is a group that was an underweight for a number of people and now you're seeing some of the momentum take off,"" said Jason Draho, head of asset allocation Americas at UBS. Earnings will show ""whether this is really a safe haven if you are worried about recession.""Alphabet and Microsoft are expected to report their results on April 25, followed by Apple on May 4. Amazon, part of the consumer discretionary sector, is expected to announce results on April 27. Tesla shares fell nearly 10% after missing earnings estimates on April 19.GRAPHIC: US tech stocks regain some lost ground https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GLOBAL-MARKETS/THEMES/znvnbjybgvl/chart.pngStory continuesCompanies will likely use earnings reports over the next several weeks to announce further plans for layoffs, which could bolster margins ahead of a recession and make their shares more attractive, said Robert Stimpson, co-chief investment officer and portfolio manager for Oak Associates Funds.Alphabet in January announced 12,000 job cuts, followed by Amazon in March with 9,000 cuts, and others that bring the total to 27,000 layoffs over recent months.""Tech corrected very hard last year and it's already discounted for some sort of recession, given that it has accepted that it has to cut headcount and retrench a little bit,"" said Stimpson. ""It's an industry that is accepting its medicine.""Stimpson is overweight technology and cutting back on his energy exposure in anticipation of a recession.However, signs of improving profitability could power ""another leg up"" in the rally, said Tom Plumb, portfolio manager of the Plumb Funds, who has large positions in Nvidia Corp and Apple. Nvidia shares are up more than 90% this year. ""We paid the penalty for holding on to a number of these stocks last year,"" Plumb said. ""In today's market growth is something that people think will be a challenge and if you can identify growth you'll be rewarded."" Still, gains could fizzle if the Fed does not cut interest rates this year, as widely expected. While the central bank has projected borrowing costs will stay around current levels until year end, investors are pricing rate cuts after the summer.Elevated rates would likely weigh heavily on technology valuations, which have soared since the year began, said Max Wasserman, senior portfolio manager at Miramar Capital. Growth stocks are especially vulnerable to high borrowing costs, which threaten to erode the value of their longer-term cash flows.Apple is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 26.5, while Microsoft's ratio is 27.4, compared to 18 for the S&amp;P 500. ""You're seeing extremely high multiples in a rising interest rates environment because the market is betting the Fed will reverse its policies,"" he said. ""We think it's a faulty assumption and the risk-reward is not in your favor.""(Reporting by David Randall; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Richard Chang)]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the pharmaceutical sector and its outlook this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2023. The pharmaceutical industry in the US is one of the largest in the world, representing roughly 50% of the global pharmaceutical sales revenue, as of 2020. The industry consists of a wide range of players, including large multinational corporations, mid-sized and small companies, and biotech startups. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry, as some companies dealing in vaccines or treatments for the virus experienced increased demand for their products. The trend of spending on Covid-related drugs continued through 2022. Some of the biggest pharma companies, like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), among others, are estimated to have generated approximately $100 billion in revenues in 2022, according to a report by Reuters.The current inflationary period has brought defensive stocks into the limelight as these stocks do not get affected by economic cycles. Pharmaceutical companies are often considered to be defensive as they deal in products that are considered essential for the maintenance of health and the treatment of illnesses, and demand for these products may remain relatively stable even during a recession. The sector also delivered positive returns to shareholders last year, when the S&amp;P 500 recorded its worst annual performance since 2008. The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index gained 4.91% from December 2021 to December 2022, compared with a 19.4% decline in the S&amp;P 500 during the same period. The index returned 3.71% in the past 12 months.Though pharma stocks delivered solid returns in 2022, the sector had a comparatively slow year pertaining to merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) deals compared with the previous years. One of the main reasons for this slowdown was that drugmakers acquired companies with authorized and tested drugs and products, instead of companies with products in clinical trials. Moreover, the economic headwinds from inflation and higher interest rates also hindered the deals last year. The deal value in the biopharma sector fell 42% in 2022, compared with 2021, as reported by Ernst &amp; Young. It was not the case in the past as large-cap pharma companies closed 178 deals from 2016 to 2020 with a total value of over $452.3 billion. However, analysts are positive about the activity gaining momentum this year. PwC expects the total M&amp;A deals to value between $225 billion and $275 billion across all sectors in 2023.

We are simply betting that the future might not be as bad as the price suggests.”Consensus FY22 and FY23 EPS estimates at the time were around $17 – $18 per share.

The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo. At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”6.

Vltava Fund mentioned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years. We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt. This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2023. Suggested articles:10 Best FAANG Stocks To Buy Now10 Best Telecom Dividend Stocks To Buy for 202310 Undervalued Lithium Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

What we care about is avoiding the permanent loss of capital.' When we think about how risky a company is, we always like to look at its use of debt, since debt overload can lead to ruin. We note that Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBA) does have debt on its balance sheet. But should shareholders be worried about its use of debt?What Risk Does Debt Bring?Debt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Having said that, the most common situation is where a company manages its debt reasonably well - and to its own advantage. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together. See our latest analysis for Walgreens Boots Alliance What Is Walgreens Boots Alliance's Net Debt?The chart below, which you can click on for greater detail, shows that Walgreens Boots Alliance had US$13.0b in debt in February 2023; about the same as the year before. On the flip side, it has US$1.84b in cash leading to net debt of about US$11.2b.debt-equity-history-analysisHow Healthy Is Walgreens Boots Alliance's Balance Sheet?We can see from the most recent balance sheet that Walgreens Boots Alliance had liabilities of US$28.2b falling due within a year, and liabilities of US$42.7b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$1.84b in cash and US$5.73b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$63.3b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.The deficiency here weighs heavily on the US$30.5b company itself, as if a child were struggling under the weight of an enormous back-pack full of books, his sports gear, and a trumpet. So we'd watch its balance sheet closely, without a doubt. After all, Walgreens Boots Alliance would likely require a major re-capitalisation if it had to pay its creditors today.Story continuesWe measure a company's debt load relative to its earnings power by looking at its net debt divided by its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) and by calculating how easily its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) cover its interest expense (interest cover). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it.Walgreens Boots Alliance's debt is 3.6 times its EBITDA, and its EBIT cover its interest expense 3.1 times over. This suggests that while the debt levels are significant, we'd stop short of calling them problematic. Worse, Walgreens Boots Alliance's EBIT was down 67% over the last year. If earnings continue to follow that trajectory, paying off that debt load will be harder than convincing us to run a marathon in the rain. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Walgreens Boots Alliance's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.Finally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. So we always check how much of that EBIT is translated into free cash flow. Happily for any shareholders, Walgreens Boots Alliance actually produced more free cash flow than EBIT over the last three years. That sort of strong cash generation warms our hearts like a puppy in a bumblebee suit.Our ViewOn the face of it, Walgreens Boots Alliance's EBIT growth rate left us tentative about the stock, and its level of total liabilities was no more enticing than the one empty restaurant on the busiest night of the year. But at least it's pretty decent at converting EBIT to free cash flow; that's encouraging. We're quite clear that we consider Walgreens Boots Alliance to be really rather risky, as a result of its balance sheet health. For this reason we're pretty cautious about the stock, and we think shareholders should keep a close eye on its liquidity. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.""Trendlines Over Headlines""On April 12 Piper Sandler's chief market technician, Craig Johnson, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the current market situation and his market outlook. According to Johnson, the market is going to undergo 3 phases: ""a hop, and drop, and a pop"", and right now we are in a ""hop"" phase. According to Johnson, the S&amp;P 500 has the potential to trade up to anywhere between 4,200 and 4,300 during the ""hop"" phase. As for the ""drop"" phase, Johnson expects the market to decline when the Fed decides to cut interest rates, which he expects will happen in the middle of 2023 or possibly in the third quarter of 2023.Craig Johnson noted that ""great downturn reversals have already occurred"" over the past 24 months on the Dow, the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ, the Russell 2000, and the Dow Jones Transportation Average as well. According to Craig Johnson, we have had ""a series of higher highs and higher lows"" and when we look at the lows that were made in September and October 2022, we observe that at that point in time the market was extremely oversold. Here are some comments from Craig Johnson:""If you come back and you look at history, all the way back to 1929, when you look at the fact that we haven't seen in the first quarter (of 2023) a break back below the December lows of last year (2022). That has historically been a pretty bullish sign for the market. In fact, when you look back in time, the market is typically 83% of the time higher, with about 13.7% annual return, when you don't break back below those December lows in the first quarter of the new year. And that's exactly what we are seeing happen this year.""Story continuesWhile the markets may undergo a correction, according to Craig Johnson, investors should focus on the long term for 2023. Craig Johnson expects the S&amp;P 500 to move up to 4,625 by the end of the year. Here is what Craig Johnson of Piper Sandler said:""If you look at some of the underlying indices, clearly, it is trendlines over headlines at this point in time... All the negativity out there at this point in time, stocks aren't going down. They're starting to trend higher and we really need to pay attention to that fact.""Craig Johnson thinks that the National Bureau of Economic Research will officially declare a recession in the back half of 2023. He noted that once a recession is official, ""history shows that you typically backdate that recession's start date by about 7.6 months"". Out of all the recessions since 1929, it was only in 2002 that the market did not bottom, said Johnson, and he thinks that after the market bottoms the S&amp;P 500 will ""pop"" back to 4,625.Craig Johnson further noted that he sees the Fed starting to cut interest rates in July 2023, or possibly after that, and this will lead to a ""quick drop"" in the markets. Craig Johnson talked about investor positioning right now and said:""We're at levels right now that we have seen only at the lows of the market in 2020, 2011, and 2007. The world is already very negatively positioned, and any drop will get bought from our perspective.""While Craig Johnson's market outlook offers valuable insights into the broader market, investors can also consider the individual stocks recommended by Fast Money traders to identify potential near-term opportunities. Fast Money is a popular TV show on CNBC that offers daily stock picks and market insights from a group of experienced traders.

While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this coffee chain have returned +8.8% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Retail - Restaurants industry, to which Starbucks belongs, has gained 7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Starbucks is expected to post earnings of $0.64 per share, indicating a change of +8.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.42 points to a change of +15.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.3%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.06 indicates a change of +18.7% from what Starbucks is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.7%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Starbucks.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for SBUX _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.In the case of Starbucks, the consensus sales estimate of $8.4 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.1%. The $35.89 billion and $39.88 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11.3% and +11.1%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryStarbucks reported revenues of $8.71 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +8.2%. EPS of $0.75 for the same period compares with $0.72 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $8.81 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -1.04%. The EPS surprise was -2.6%.Over the last four quarters, Starbucks surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates just once over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Starbucks is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Starbucks. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That is, insiders sold more stock than they bought.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, logic dictates you should pay some attention to whether insiders are buying or selling shares. Check out our latest analysis for Sysco Sysco Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Independent Director, Sheila Talton, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$191k worth of shares at a price of US$77.24 each. So we know that an insider sold shares at around the present share price of US$75.56. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. Given that the sale took place at around current prices, it makes us a little cautious but is hardly a major concern. The only individual insider seller over the last year was Sheila Talton.You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction!insider-trading-volumeFor those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.Insiders At Sysco Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Sysco. In total, Independent Director Sheila Talton dumped US$191k worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Does Sysco Boast High Insider Ownership?Another way to test the alignment between the leaders of a company and other shareholders is to look at how many shares they own. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Sysco insiders own about US$66m worth of shares. That equates to 0.2% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Sysco Insiders?An insider hasn't bought Sysco stock in the last three months, but there was some selling. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. On the plus side, Sysco makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. We're in no rush to buy! So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. To help with this, we've discovered 2 warning signs (1 is potentially serious!) that you ought to be aware of before buying any shares in Sysco.But note: Sysco may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

Let’s take a closer look at the performance of each post-split.Monster BeverageOn February 28th, 2023, the energy beverage titan Monster declared a 2-for-1 split; shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis on March 28th, 2023.Since the split, MNST shares have etched in a 2.4% gain, underperforming relative to the S&amp;P 500 by a fair margin.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchMonster sports a solid growth trajectory, with earnings forecasted to climb more than 30% in its current fiscal year (FY23) and a further 17% in FY24.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTeslaIn June of 2022, the mega-popular EV manufacturer announced a three-for-one stock split; shares began trading on a split-adjusted basis on August 25th, 2022.Since the split, Tesla shares have declined by 45% in value, coming nowhere near the general market’s performance.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTesla reported earnings this week; results came in somewhat mixed, with the company posting a 2.4% EPS beat and a negative 1% sales surprise. The market didn’t appreciate the results, with TSLA shares facing selling pressure post-earnings.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchAlphabetThe tech titan Alphabet announced a 20-for-1 split in early 2022.

67,511cdb21-17c6-3971-ae66-7413384db221,PM,2023-04-22,Returns On Capital At Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM) Paint A Concerning Picture,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/returns-capital-philip-morris-international-140021110.html,1682085621,STORY,['PM'],"[Did you know there are some financial metrics that can provide clues of a potential multi-bagger? Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. This shows us that it's a compounding machine, able to continually reinvest its earnings back into the business and generate higher returns. Having said that, while the ROCE is currently high for Philip Morris International (NYSE:PM), we aren't jumping out of our chairs because returns are decreasing.Return On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?For those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. The formula for this calculation on Philip Morris International is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.30 = US$12b ÷ (US$62b - US$23b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).Therefore, Philip Morris International has an ROCE of 30%. That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 16% earned by companies in a similar industry. View our latest analysis for Philip Morris International roceAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Philip Morris International compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Philip Morris International.So How Is Philip Morris International's ROCE Trending?In terms of Philip Morris International's historical ROCE movements, the trend isn't fantastic. To be more specific, while the ROCE is still high, it's fallen from 45% where it was five years ago. However it looks like Philip Morris International might be reinvesting for long term growth because while capital employed has increased, the company's sales haven't changed much in the last 12 months. It's worth keeping an eye on the company's earnings from here on to see if these investments do end up contributing to the bottom line.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTo conclude, we've found that Philip Morris International is reinvesting in the business, but returns have been falling. Since the stock has gained an impressive 57% over the last five years, investors must think there's better things to come. Ultimately, if the underlying trends persist, we wouldn't hold our breath on it being a multi-bagger going forward.One more thing to note, we've identified   2 warning signs  with Philip Morris International and understanding them should be part of your investment process.High returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.Have feedback on this article?

Solid momentum across the Deltek, Vertafore, Aderant, CliniSys and Data Innovations businesses is likely to have aided the Application Software segment. Also, strength in its recurring revenue stream, led by strong customer retention, continued migration to SaaS delivery models, focus on the core utility market and new cloud solution is likely to have driven the segment’s performance.The Network Software &amp; Systems segment is anticipated to have benefited from the strong performance of freight-matching businesses and strength across the Foundry business owing to solid innovation capability in Nuke and Katana. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Network Software &amp; Systems segment’s revenues in the first quarter hints at a 1.1% increase from the sequential quarter’s reported figure.Strength in the Verathon business, driven by single-use Bronchoscopy and Laryngoscopy offerings, is expected to have aided the Technology Enabled Products segment in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the Technology Enabled Products segment’s revenues in the first quarter hints at a 2.6% increase from the sequential quarter’s reported figure.The Frontline buyout is expected to have benefited the company’s bottom line in the to-be-reported quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for ROP’s earnings in the first quarter indicates a 2.1% increase from the year-ago reported number.However, raw material cost inflation and supply-chain constraints are likely to have dented Roper’s performance. The high cost of sales is likely to have weighed on the company’s bottom line. Given Roper’s considerable exposure to overseas markets, adverse foreign currency movements might have impacted the top line.Story continuesRoper Technologies, Inc.

This morning's call is being recorded, and a replay of the call will be available later today. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Sam.Story continuesSamuel N. HazenAll right. Thank you, Frank, and good morning. Thank you for joining our call. The operational momentum we had at the end of the last year continued into the first quarter of 2023. The company produced solid earnings that reflected strong demand for our services and improvement in our operating costs, in particular, contract labor expenses. For the quarter, diluted earnings per share, excluding losses on sales of facilities, grew by almost 20% to $4.93. Adjusted EBITDA grew close to 8%. Same-facility volumes across the company were strong in the first quarter. Admissions grew 4.4% year-over-year. Non-COVID admissions were up 12%. Our inpatient business continued to be supported by strong acuity and a favorable payer mix. Inpatient surgeries increased 3.6%. Same facility equivalent admissions increased 7.5%. This was driven by emergency room visits, which grew 10%, and outpatient surgeries, which grew 5%. Other outpatient categories also grew, including outpatient cardiology procedures, which increased 7%.The demand increase was broad-based across most of the company's footprint and service lines contributing the same facility revenue growth of 5% as compared to the prior year. With respect to our people agenda, we saw continued improvements across virtually all metrics. The improvement in turnover rates accelerated from the fourth quarter, and we ended the quarter close to pre-pandemic levels. Registered nurse hiring also improved in the quarter. Hiring increased almost 19% compared to the previous 4 quarter average. These positive results helped reduce contract labor costs 21% compared to last year. We continue to invest in our people through compensation programs, increased training and innovative care models. We believe these programs advanced our capabilities to provide high-quality care to our patients.Once again, our colleagues demonstrated a remarkable ability to adapt and deliver value across all stakeholder groups. I want to thank them for their dedication, their hard work and their overall effectiveness. During the quarter, we continued to experience periodic capacity constraints that prevented us from fully operating our capacity as compared to the fourth quarter. Instances where we could not accept patients from other hospitals declined 25% and represented 1.5% of total admissions in the quarter, which was down from 2% in the fourth quarter. While we are pleased with this improved trend, it still remains above pre-pandemic levels. Close with this, we remain encouraged by the backdrop of strong demand that we saw in our markets. We intend to maintain our disciplined approach to executing our strategic and capital allocation plans as we push through the rest of this year. And lastly, we believe the investments we are making in our network, our people and our technology will provide us with the necessary resources to improve our services and provide high-quality care to our patients. Given the strong results in the quarter and the favorable factors we expect with demand, you will see that we have increased our guidance for the year. With that, I'll turn the call to Bill for more details.William B. RutherfordGreat. Thank you, Sam, and good morning, everyone. I will provide some additional comments on our performance for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $3.17 billion as compared to $2.94 billion in the prior year. As noted in our release, in the first quarter of this year, we recorded an increase in revenues of $145 million related to resolving certain disputed claims with a commercial payer that covered a 6-year period. In the prior year quarter, we recorded an additional $244 million of revenues and $90 million of expenses that related to the Texas-directed payment program for an earlier period. I will also note, as it relates to prior year comparisons, we still were experiencing high level of COVID volumes in the first quarter of 2022. COVID admissions accounted for 9.7% of admissions last year compared to about 3% this year. In addition, in the prior year quarter, we recognized approximately $190 million of COVID-related support payments versus about $30 million in this year's first quarter. Sam highlighted our positive volume metrics in the quarter, and this was coupled with good payer mix and case mix trends. Same facility managed care and other admissions grew 4.2% during the quarter when compared to the prior year and non-COVID managed care admissions grew 11.3% versus the prior year. Non-COVID case mix improved just under 1% as compared to both prior year and sequentially from the fourth quarter. This contributed to our non-COVID inpatient revenue per admission increasing 2.2% as compared to the first quarter of last year. We remain pleased with our team's management of operating costs even with the backdrop of higher inflation. Our consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.3% in the quarter. Labor costs as a percentage of revenue improved both sequentially and when compared to the prior year, and our supply costs continue to trend favorably as well. We have discussed previously other operating expenses have been subject to some inflationary cost pressures and increased approximately 20 basis points as a percentage of revenue when compared to the prior year. So let me speak to some cash flow and capital allocation metrics as they remain a key part of our long-term growth and value-creation strategies. Our cash flow from operations increased $458 million in the quarter from $1.35 billion in the prior year to $1.8 billion this year. Capital spending was just under $1.2 billion. We paid $175 million in dividends and repurchased just under $850 million of our stock during the quarter. Our debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio remains near the low end of our stated leverage range of 3x to 4x. As noted in our release this morning, we are updating our full year 2023 guidance as follows: we expect revenues to range between $62.5 billion and $64.5 billion. We expect net income attributable to HCA Healthcare to range between $4.75 billion and $5.16 billion. We expect full year adjusted EBITDA at a range between $12.1 billion and $12.7 billion. And we expect full year diluted earnings per share to range between $17.25 and $18.55. And lastly, we expect capital spending to approximate $4.6 billion during the year. I will mention that our updated capital spending guidance is based on opportunities we believe exist to continue to invest growth agenda, and it also considers some land acquisitions we are planning for future development. In addition, we are seeing some inflationary increases in construction costs that we have factored into our guidance as well. Finally, I will mention in early April, we closed on a transaction to increase our ownership interest in the Velasco joint venture with envision. We will consolidate this venture beginning in the second quarter and expect the venture will generate approximately $1 billion of annual revenues with no material impact to adjusted EBITDA. So with that, I'll turn the call over to Frank, and we'll open it up for Q&amp;A. We look forward to your questions.Frank George MorganThank you, Bill. (Operator Instructions) Rob, you may now give instructions to those who would like to ask a question.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions)And your first question comes from the line of A.J. Rice from Credit Suisse.Albert J. William RiceMaybe obviously, there's a lot of positive trends this quarter, both on the volume side as well as what you're seeing, particularly expenses with labor. When you sit here and look at the rest of the year, I know you updated guidance and updated it a little further than just the beat in the quarter. What are the variables that you see could swing either more positive or negative? Are there open questions with respect to how labor trends the rest of the year, how volume trends for the rest of the year? Or maybe some other metric that I'm not highlighting that you see as putting you at different points within the range or offering variability? Can you maybe flesh that out a little further?William B. RutherfordYes. A.J., this is Bill. I'll start and then Sam can add in. I think as we said in our comments, we believe there is momentum that we're seeing in the market. We saw that late '22. We were fortunate that continued into the first quarter. We continue to see good volume expectations in the market. You saw our same-store admissions. Our non-COVID volume was pretty robust, emergency room activity remains busy. So we feel reasonably positive on our volume outlook that we've given. Our revenue per unit, we're pleased with. We're pleased with the payer mix trends and the acuity and case mix. They're stable and maintaining the levels that we anticipated. And then on the cost side, we believe the teams have managed costs very well. We knew that labor improved throughout '22. Obviously, first quarter of last year was a high watermark for us in labor. So we're pleased with where it is today. We hope there's continued improvement to be made, especially around the utilization of contract labor. And so generally, we're feeling pretty good about the cost metrics. There are some inflationary cost trends we're seeing, as I mentioned, in other operating that tends to show itself around our professional fees and some of those fixed cost items that we don't have as much input over. But generally speaking, we think our revised guidance and our outlook reflects our view for the balance of the year.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Whit Mayo from SVB Securities.Benjamin Whitman MayoI was just wondering if you guys could unpack some of the growth that you're seeing in outpatient surgeries between the ASCs and HOPD and maybe comment on any particular pockets of strength or weakness across some of those surgical service lines. And kind of a corollary to this question, too, is just the supply cost look very good even with the surgical growth. So if you could maybe elaborate on that dynamic, Bill, that would be helpful.Samuel N. HazenWhit, this is Sam. Thank you for your question. We had strong activity in both settings. Our surgical volumes and our hospital outpatient units were up actually slightly more than what was inside of our ambulatory surgery centers. Across all service categories within both settings, we saw a really solid volume growth. So it was broad-based, as I mentioned in my comments. We continue to invest in both. We have a more significant investment in our ambulatory surgery center development pipeline with a number of new developments as well as some possible acquisitions that are complementary to the networks that we have across the company. We're really pleased with our surgical activity. We're also very pleased with our inpatient surgical activity as we've seen growth in both our emergency surgeries as a result of our emergency room activity as well as elective surgeries across different disciplines. The only category that was down actually our C-sections, where we didn't have as much obstetric volume as we did in other parts of our business. And so if you normalize for that, dynamic, we were actually up more significantly in the more acute categories of our service lines. So a very solid result for us from a surgical volume standpoint. Our supply costs have continued to perform well. We have a great supply chain capability in our company, and we utilize it to leverage best practices, contracting logistics, inventory management and so forth. And we continue to maintain even with increased acuity, increased surgical activity good metrics around our supply cost.OperatorAnd your next question comes from the line of Justin Lake from Wolfe Research.Justin LakeI wanted to follow up on the labor side. I think you said temp labor costs were down 21% year-over-year. Can you confirm that for me? And then just give us a little color in terms of the percentage of hours, nursing hours that came from temp labor, temp labor as a percentage of SW or -- temp labor as a percentage of SWB dollars and anything else kind of in terms of trends that you're expecting in temp labor through the year that's implied in guidance? Where do you expect to come out of the year on some of those metrics?William B. RutherfordYes. Thanks, Justin. This is Bill. So yes, I'll confirm our contract labor was down about 20% year-over-year, and again, we're continuing to be pleased with the trends in there. It's really rooted in the fact that our recruitment is up and turnover is down. So a lot of effort in that front. For the quarter, our contract labor was about 7.1% of our SWB. That compares to about 9.5% last year, and we were running mid-7s through the last half of '22, so good trends. Contract labor as a percent of ours was about 10.3% where, this time last year, we were 11.5%, almost 11.6%. So again, continued improvement in that area, really just rooted by lot of efforts we have in the recruitment and retention. As we go through the year, we hope we'll continue to see favorable trends in that, hoping we can get in that 6.5% to 7% by the time we finish this year. So a lot of effort continues by the teams to focus on that.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Ben Hendrix from RBC Capital Markets.Benjamin HendrixCould you comment a little further on the same-facility revenue per admission and equivalent admission comps? It looks like maybe lower year-over-year rates in the outpatient volume offset inpatient rate growth. Perhaps you could flesh out the dynamics there for the first quarter and how that could play out for the balance of the year. .William B. RutherfordYes. I'll make a first step, Ben. I think, first, you have to recognize on the year-over-year comparisons, the COVID activity has a significant influence on the year-over-year comparisons. When our COVID admissions went from 9.7% last year to 3%, and COVID revenue per admission runs much higher than our non-COVID, is really influencing the as reported. That's why in my prepared remarks I talked about our non-COVID revenue per admission was 2.2% growth. We've seen sequential improvement in case mix. I think overall, I'd say we're pleased with where the performance is and our acuity in our payer mix and the revenue yield we have when we look at sequentially especially on that. So that was the main thing affecting the as reported, was the COVID volume. When we exclude COVID, we're really pleased with the revenue per unit ramps. Outpatient growth was heavy during the quarter, driven, as we talked about, with the emergency room. So that is influencing the per equivalent admission statistics while we broke down the per admission as well. But again, very pleased with the outpatient growth demand that we're seeing as well as the inpatient. So we're pleased with the top line metrics that we're seeing.Benjamin HendrixJust as a quick follow-up, can you parse out the degree to which your -- the acuity that you're seeing is just kind of normalization in terms of admission patterns versus kind of some of the investments you've made to expand your network capabilities?William B. RutherfordIt's hard to parse it out. I mean it's all inclusive. I mean, obviously, with a good surgical volume that we had, that helped fuel that. We do continue to see recovery of demand in the marketplace. But we continue to invest in growing our service offerings and our higher acuity services. So it's hard to parse out and attribute that from one or the other, but both I think are factors in the trends we're seeing.Samuel N. HazenYes, and Bill, I think it's important to understand that our acuity or case mix index, the composite view of that is holding strong and actually up over 2019 when you consider we've lost a really high case mix component in total joint surgery. So I think that speaks to the underlying acuity mix within our remaining inpatient portfolio. We also had total joint surgery growth when you look at inpatient and outpatient again in the quarter. But nonetheless, those cases are now in the outpatient setting and out of our inpatient mix, but yet we've been able to sustain really strong acuity mix in total. And that's due to, again, program development, as Bill alluded to, specific efforts in certain markets and certain facilities to advance their clinical capabilities, and it's yielding what we hoped.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Gary Taylor from Cowen.Gary Paul TaylorOne of my favorite expressions is when Sam starts talking about EBITDA clearance rates. So I was disappointed not to hear that catch phrase this morning, but otherwise really solid quarter. My question is about commercial rate cycle. I think with all the moving parts with COVID, even when we see the Q, it's going to be hard to sort of tease out what's happening there. So just wanted to see if you could just update us on how you're doing on your commercial rate renewals. Is there any material activity on off-cycle renewals? Does this $145 million settlement say anything about the environment in terms of how you're positioned with the payers? Or is it just completely sort of a one-off?Samuel N. HazenSo Gary, not to disappoint our EBITDA clearance in the quarter was 36%. So that's a really good metric for us, recognizing operating leverage in the face of really inflation. So it sort of proves the model when we can drive activity into our facilities where we have embedded fixed cost, we're able to turn that into earnings in a very productive way. Again, it speaks to our management team's ability to manage their operations effectively. We're pleased with what's going on in our payer contracting cycles. As we said, we're targeting mid-single-digit increases, and we are achieving that in most circumstances. And I think the payers recognize again the pressures in the marketplace for providers and are allowing sort of responsible increases. So we are roughly contracted for 2023. We're 93% of the way there. We're about 2/3 of the way through 2024 and about 1/4 of the way through 2025. And at this particular point in time, we're able to maintain the trend that we feel is necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances. The one payer settlement that we talked about, we have processes in place in our Parallon organization, which we believe is a best-in-class revenue cycle capability. And through their efforts and through our support efforts of other components of our business, we were able to resolve some claims that we felt were underpaid in previous years, and those payments were recognized in this particular quarter. I don't know that it's reflective of anything in the marketplace other than the specifics around that particular circumstance. I will say that we are focused on making sure that we have the right controls in place, the right relationships in place and the right procedures around ensuring that we get the reimbursement that we have earned. And if there are underpayments or denials that we think are not appropriate, then we will make sure that we work our way through those disputes to get to the answer that we think is appropriate for the company. And I wouldn't say that's anything new necessarily, but it continues to be an ongoing opportunity.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Pito Chickering from Deutsche Bank.Philip ChickeringAny color on how full-time nurse wage inflation is tracking so far this year versus your expectations? And are you seeing any competitors increase their wages again in 2023? Or is it pretty stable at this point? And on the non-nursing staff, where is that tracking? And can you reflect us on what you assume for nursing and non-nursing wage inflation for 2023 in your guidance?Samuel N. HazenPito, this is Sam. I think our overall compensation per hour across all aspects of our workforce are trending where we expected them to trend this year. And we're pleased with the progress. And that's in the face of us making some fairly significant increases over the latter part of '22. And we continue to make modest increases in certain market circumstances in '23, responding to new data or new understandings around what's happening from one market to the other. As I mentioned on our call, our turnover was down. Our nursing turnover was approaching pre-pandemic levels. We were running about 15% -- 14.5% to 15% in 2018 and 2019. We're running about 17% when you look at the last 6 months annualized. So a very good trend happening. And we think it's again a factor of the macro trends, some of our specific actions around compensation program, efforts to really increase resourcing and capabilities for our nurses and other caregivers. So we're really encouraged by the efforts of our teams, the recruitment metrics that we're seeing and where we are competitively in the market. Will there be a market here or there that we have to adjust to as we move through the year? Yes. We believe that's factored into our guidance appropriately, and we should be able to manage through those changes as the year progresses.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Joshua Raskin from Nephron Research.Joshua Richard RaskinCould you speak to the increase in CapEx guidance for the year? And I'm curious if you accelerate anything specifically in 1Q as that came in a little bit above where we were thinking? I'm specifically interested in the types of projects that are getting funded and especially the ones that have been -- that weren't contemplated maybe 3 months ago? And then lastly, I heard real estate purchases. I'm assuming those are for new inpatient hospital facilities over time.Samuel N. HazenYes. This is Sam. Thank you for the question. We have a number of communities that we serve where we believe, over time, we're going to need to add to our hospital network, We're obviously adding significantly to our outpatient network. We have approximately 2,500 outpatient facilities that support our 180 or so hospitals across our communities. But we believe that over time, as our communities continue to grow, and we believe that's one of the differentiating attributes of HCA, that are -- we're in great markets that have great growth prospects in and of themselves, before we get to share gain possibilities in those markets, that is going to require us to build out some new hospital facilities. We do have a new hospital opening in -- or under construction in San Antonio -- actually 2 in San Antonio as we speak, but San Antonio is one of those markets where we have uniquely high occupancy. That market, for example, we run approximately 90% occupancy. And we think it's better for us to open up new hospitals as opposed to keep adding on in every circumstance in that particular community. But we do own land in Austin, Texas, for new hospitals, we own land in Dallas for new hospitals. We just recently purchased in the first quarter land for new hospitals in Las Vegas and Salt Lake City. We have land for new hospitals in a number of Florida markets. So that's part of what you're seeing in our capital spending, is that we are acquiring land for future network development. In addition to that, we have significantly advanced our outpatient facility development. That doesn't put too much pressure on our capital spending, but there are some elements of it that are in the increased guidance. And then finally, I think it's important for everybody to understand, we are still in a situation where we have a lot of facilities that have high levels of occupancy. In the first quarter, the company ran approximately 73% to 74% occupancy in its inpatient facilities. And we need to have sufficient capacity as we build up our staffing over time. We need physical capacity to accommodate what we believe to be the demand for healthcare. So the projects are really mixed among those 3 things: land acquisitions for future hospital development, outpatient network development and then relieving capacity constraints on the existing platform of facilities that we have today.William B. RutherfordAnd Josh, this is Bill. I'll add. We obviously can accommodate that increasing capital within the resources we're generating and within our overall capital allocation philosophies that we have. And we also continue to see really strong returns on invested capital. So we have confidence that these investments will continue to generate growth for us into the future.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies.Brian Gil TanquilutBill, maybe just a question on how we should be thinking about the moving pieces or considerations for the second quarter. I know you called out the Envision contribution to revenue and then maybe the New Orleans Hospital. But anything that we should be thinking about sequentially and year-over-year?William B. RutherfordYes. Brian, nothing material. I mean, once we kind of anniversary the high-COVID volume, which is principally first quarter. Second quarter of last year, we began to see the start of normalization. Obviously, we're coming off some continued high labor costs in the first quarter. We saw some improvement in the second quarter and obviously improvement as we went through the balance of the year. So I can't say there's anything material, I can call out, especially one quarter to the next. We typically wouldn't do that. But for the balance of the year, now that we've got the majority of the high COVID behind us in terms of the year-over-year comparisons, things should begin to normalize for the most part.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Andrew Mok from UBS.Andrew MokYou provided some breakeven metrics on Medicaid redeterminations in the past. Hoping you could provide an updated view on how you expect that to play out over the next 18 to 24 months and what sort of impact that could have on near and intermediate-term operating results. .William B. RutherfordYes. Thanks. I mean, obviously, this is an area we continue to pay attention to. We've got a fairly formalized approach inside of the company. We haven't seen any impact yet as those redeterminations are just beginning to occur, but we are keeping very close to state plans. We've also made outreach to our Medicaid patients to help them look at alternative coverage in the event they find themselves displaced to Medicaid. We continue to be encouraged with some of the third-party studies that we read that a relatively high percentage of those individuals potentially qualify for employer-sponsored coverage or through enhanced subsidies coverage within the health insurance marketplace. So we are staying very close to that. We are increasing our efforts to help people identify coverage that are available to them, trying to work with states and other community agencies where necessary to help people land coverage. So too early to be able to quantify what the impact of that may be. But ultimately, I believe when people can find coverage in the exchanges or through their employer. We wouldn't really anticipate any material downside, and hopefully, there could be some upside benefit to that over the long run.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Scott Fidel from Stephens.Scott J. FidelInterested if you could talk about how you're thinking about the sustainability of the surgical growth trends over the balance of the year, both in inpatient and outpatient. And interested if -- was there any catch-up just as COVID really diminished in the first quarter? Or do you see those types of growth trends are sustainable over the course of the year?William B. RutherfordWe're looking -- one, we're pleased with the trends. It's hard to parse exactly the contribution of that. I think overall, we're pleased with the demand and the activity we see in the market. We continue to see -- believe that we're going to return to normal historical volume patterns. And if that does show itself, we should see continued growth in both inpatient and outpatient surgical volume. We continue to invest in our outpatient footprint. That should help drive reasonable outpatient surgical growth. Our program development in the inpatient side should help continue to show good inpatient surgical growth as well. So we'll just have to see that. I think, typically, we would see 1% to 2% type of surgical growth. And as the year goes on, hopefully, we'll continue to see that.Samuel N. HazenYes. And just to add to that, Bill. I think as we continue to increase our staffing capacity, it also affects our surgical capacity because we do have instances where we're not able to open all of our operating rooms as sufficiently as we would prefer also. And so as our labor situation continues to get better, we think that will allow us to open up more surgical capacity, and we believe the demand in the market is still there. So we're encouraged by where we are with our surgical volumes, and we think we have some things that should prop it up, if you will, as we move through the year with our staffing agenda and our human resource strategies.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Lance Wilkes from Bernstein.Lance Arthur WilkesActually, that's a perfect lead into my question. Could you talk a little bit about your outlook for staff growth? And in particular, obviously, you had the shift from temporary to permanent which has been great. Can you talk about how your staff has grown or maybe registered nurse staff or something like that over the last year? And then as you're looking forward, are there any particular impediments to continued levels of growth?Samuel N. HazenWell, our total headcount was up around 2% when you look at this first quarter against last first quarter, and let me make sure that -- actually, it's more like 3% when you factor out the 2-lane divestiture. So we're up 3% quarter-over-quarter, which is obviously solid improvement in the market. As we've mentioned in the third quarter and the fourth quarter of last year, we were starting to see some momentum with our hiring, some momentum with our retention programs and so forth. And that's carried through into the first quarter really well. I think our overall hiring was up 13% or something like that. But in the quarter compared to the running average, it was up 19%, and that's mostly in nursing. I don't know that it will run that hot as we move through the rest of the year nor will we need it to run that hot as we move through the rest of the year. So our efforts with our recruitment, our efforts with retention will continue. We're encouraged by other programs that we have to support our people and put them in the best position to succeed and deliver high-quality care. We have a significant investment we're making in clinical education. Our Galen School of Nursing continues to grow, and we're really encouraged by what those programs will do for our facilities and our people over time. So those things are all part and parcel to a very comprehensive effort to make sure we have the right amount of staff, they're supplied with the right technology and resources to deliver high-quality care and they can be successful in growing our company. So we're pretty encouraged by where we are.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Calvin Sternick from JPMorgan.Calvin Alexander SternickWanted to ask about capacity. I know you said 1.5% for the quarter but still above pre-pandemic levels and labor improving. So just want to get a sense, what are some of the other key variables for getting the declination rate back down to historical levels? And where do you think you can get to by year-end?Samuel N. HazenWell, hopefully, we get back to prepandemic levels. We benchmarked a lot of our metrics against where we were in 2019 so that we can have a comparison of sort of more normalized environment. But obviously, our leverage, and as I just mentioned, is very important to our abilities to open up all of our bed capacity and surgical capacity and so forth. Even our emergency room capacity sometimes can be constrained because of staffing levels and such. I think it will continue to get better. As we went through the first quarter, March was better than January as an example. So that's a positive trend within the quarter. We're hopeful that, that will sustain itself as we move through the balance of the year. And as we look at some of our hiring and the timing of that hiring, that should line up with some continued improvement as we sequentially move through the year. So those are the main things. Some -- we have capital that will come online over the course of the year, as we always do. That will help in certain circumstances. But I think the most important variable is staff and getting sufficient staff into our facilities, allowing us to open up our beds and so forth appropriately.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette from Barclays.Steven James ValiquetteSo really one main question here. When looking at some of the hospital-related volume commentary from medical device companies over the past week or 2, at least one of them suggested from their view that hospital volumes were the strongest in January and February then normalized in March. And I know no one really likes questions on the monthly performance. So really just my more high-level question is if you could just comment on whether or not the momentum in your overall operations was generally pretty consistent throughout the quarter. And then also, is the full year '23 guidance increase meant to reflect mainly just the upside witnessed in 1Q? And is the rest of the year outlook is generally unchanged from your prior view? Or should we all expect strong momentum from the first quarter to continue into 2Q? Just kind of can I have your thoughts around all that for just the overall operations would be helpful?William B. RutherfordWell, again, I think we've seen momentum on there. So yes, the guidance is, I think, is referenced by a few others, principally the performance in the first quarter that we saw. But as we look at volume through the quarter, I think it was pretty consistent on there. We're feeling positive with some of the trends we're seeing. It's hard to call exactly what may happen and exactly what period they will. But we continue to see good demand in the markets. We continue to add our capacity, continue to be able to serve that. So we think we've incorporated all reasonable assumptions into the guidance going forward. And that's where we stand right now and we'll continue to monitor as the year goes on.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jason Cassorla from Citigroup.Jason Paul CassorlaYou noted favorable payer mix in the quarter. I was hoping you can give us a sense on commercial -- core commercial volume growth split out between exchange-related volumes and then just pure commercial. And perhaps if you saw in 1Q or are currently seeing any commercial volume pull forward perhaps ahead of potential coverage changes later this year? Or do you think that commercial volume trend is just more broad-based? Any color on that would be very helpful.William B. RutherfordYes. I mean, as I mentioned in my comments, our non-COVID commercial volume was up a little over 11%. So obviously, that's a stat we're very pleased. We're very pleased with the exchange enrollment. We saw really good enrollment across our states. Some of the publicly released data that you've seen, we've seen exchange enrollment in Florida up 18%, Texas up close to 30%. And that generally (inaudible) is pretty well with where we would expect exchange volume to be. Our exchange volume just year-over-year was up, what, 19% or so for the quarter. It's hard to make some of those comparisons pure on the non-exchange because COVID has such an impact on that. But if I back up and look at the non-COVID growth of managed care at 11% is still so pretty strong. And even overall, we were up 4%. So again, we're thinking that there's good payer mix will continue, good demand. We still see basically full employment in most of our markets. So we'll see where that plays out. But we are pleased with the health insurance exchange activity that we're seeing across the markets.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Sarah [Gains] from Cantor Fitzgerald.Unidentified AnalystI'm trying to piece together a few of the comments that you made on contract labor. You talked about getting down to about 6.5% to 7% exiting the year. Is that in line with what you've been thinking before? I thought you guys were a little bit lower. And then how do you think about reinvesting the savings of that? So how much is going to wage inflation versus actually increasing headcount? Or is any of it falling to the bottom line as sort of a margin relief?William B. RutherfordWell, I mean, there's a lot of moving parts in our labor side. And obviously, our focus has been reducing the utilization of our premium labor, and that has allowed us to continue to invest in our employed workforce. And we continue to invest in our existing employees both through wage rates as well as hiring that was spoken about earlier on the call. And so when we roll it all up, we kind of look at the overall impact. And yes, we are fortunate that as we've been able to reduce contract labor, that's allowed us to make the investments into our employed workforce. I think that will continue. I think our commentary around our expectations has been reasonably consistent. If you looked at where we ran kind of pre-COVID, it was probably in that 6% range. We think we can continue to make progress on that. So it's fairly consistent. But again, we are investing much of the benefit of contract labor back into our existing employees.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Stephen Baxter from Wells Fargo.Stephen C. BaxterI just wanted to follow up on another question. You mentioned having a pretty decent amount of visibility on 2024 contracting at this point. I mean, can you just remind us how the 2/3 compared to where you might have been in a more typical pre-COVID environment? And I think you also alluded that the commercial rate dynamics continuing to be acknowledged by payers at the same general magnitude. Just want to confirm if that was what you meant by those comments.Samuel N. HazenI'm not sure I understood the second part of that question. But the first part of the question, we're, like I said, running mid-single digits on our renewed contracts. We were running 3.5% or so prepandemic with our commercial contracting. So it is up a little bit. Again, it's reflective of, I think, the overall inflationary environment that most organizations find themselves. But we think it's a responsible ask and it's been received reasonably well by the payers that we've renewed. What was the second question?William B. RutherfordWell, I think the other one was around the percentage of our contracts that are completed for '24? Is it consistent with where its historical...Samuel N. HazenOh, yes, it is.William B. RutherfordAnd if it is consistent with where we would have historically been.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Jamie Perse from Goldman Sachs.Jamie Aaron PerseI wanted to ask a question about the procedure shift to outpatient. First, can you help us quantify what the headwind from that shift has been to revenue and EBITDA over the last couple of years? And then two, categories like knees and hips, so a little bit more homogenous, how do we think about the shift of categories like cardiology? You mentioned that was up 7% in the outpatient setting in the quarter. Are there big categories in cardiology that are analogous to total joints that you think are a big category that is so amenable to that shift to outpatients that we should be thinking about impacting the transition in the near term?Samuel N. HazenWe don't see any particular procedural category facing the same type of pressure as total joints did. I think our company is somewhere around 80% of our total joints today are done as an outpatient with 20% done as an inpatient. That was reversed prepandemic. So we've absorbed all of that. And it was a headwind with respect to a P&amp;L impact over this time period. The rest of the categories are not as discrete as total joints. And in cardiac, particularly, a large piece of our cardiac volumes today are already in the outpatient setting. And so we don't anticipate anything in that particular category shifting like total joints have shifted. We've seen some shift over time in spine, and that's more incremental than it is holistic like total joints. We've seen some in cardiac over the years. We've seen some with our robotics platform. Those continue sort of on the margin. They're not structurally repositioning like total joints did. And so our company has effectively navigated that transition. Again, we have a multifaceted offering for patients and physicians, both in our facilities, outpatient within our facilities, ambulatory surgery centers and so forth. And that's -- one of those settings is the right setting for just about every patient. And I think our organization has been able to grow as a result of that multifaceted offering. And our total joints, like I said earlier, are actually up year-over-year and they were up last year compared to the previous year. So we've seen good growth in our orthopedic programs, and we continue to work with our surgeons and our service line leaders to advance our capabilities as well.OperatorAnd there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Frank Morgan. I turn the call back over to you for some final closing remarks.Frank George MorganRob, thank you for your help today, and thanks for everyone for joining the call. We hope you have a great weekend. I'm around this afternoon. If we can answer any additional questions you might have, reach out. Thank you.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call.

I'd like to welcome you to our First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. I will keep my comments brief, providing a few highlights on our first quarter financial performance and on our outlook. Our first quarter sales were a record $4.4 billion and were achieved despite the backdrop of macro challenges, including soft global industrial activity, elevated cost inflation, continued geopolitical issues and weakening demand in U.S. construction-related end use markets. We delivered adjusted earnings per diluted share from continuing operations of $1.82, which is 33% higher than the first quarter of 2022. Our operating segment margin recovery accelerated, improving 380 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2022 as we work back toward our historical profile. The first quarter was aided by incremental 2023 selling price increases in the Performance Coatings reporting segment and in total company-wide. We have now fully offset all cumulative cost inflation incurred since early 2021. As I highlight some of the key drivers that drove the strong first quarter performance, an overriding theme is around the benefits we are deriving from our diverse portfolio. For example, PPG has the largest and most diversified aerospace business in the coatings industry. We are well positioned to serve our customers in the aerospace aftermarket, and our backlogs expanded once again this quarter following the reopening in China as customers need to replenish their stock with PPG's technologically advantaged products, including sealants and transparencies. We expect this business to continue to grow for the remainder of 2023 and beyond. Also, PPG has the largest architectural coatings business in Mexico, where current economic conditions remain robust and among the best in the world. The PPG Comex business continued their strong execution and delivered an 11th consecutive quarter of record sales. We are laser-focused on driving organic growth. During the quarter, we benefited from several customer wins that included becoming the primary paint supplier at Walmart's 3,800 locations that carry paint products. The expansion of our well-recognized Glidden DIY brand at Walmart and in our independent dealer channel will support further growth opportunities. The automotive refinish business has now installed 1,400 global MOONWALK machines, recently gaining traction in the U.S. with additional rollouts planned globally. About 1/3 of these installations are new body shop wins. While overall demand conditions in Europe remain difficult, our leading position in automotive OEM in the region allowed us to support our customers during a sharp rise in automotive builds in the region, albeit off a historically low base. Our OEM sales volumes in the region were up mid-teen percentage for the quarter and we expect additional growth throughout 2023. The first quarter is typically a negative cash generation quarter due to our business seasonality. However, our strong earnings contributed to us generating positive operating cash flow in the first quarter for the first time in 7 years as our operating cash generated was about $400 million higher than the first quarter of 2022. Our financial results were better than our preliminary first quarter update on April 3. This was mostly attributable to stronger sales at the end of the month, a richer sales mix and lower costs than we predicted. A quick update to our very important ESG initiatives. We are prioritizing and delivering sustainably advantaged products and services to our customers and view this as a key lever for organic growth. Last year, we increased our sales from sustainably advantaged products to 39% of our total sales and continue to better define our product sustainability priorities to enable the sustainability ambitions of our customers. We look forward to sharing our new 2030 targets once our emissions reduction goals are validated by the Science-Based Targets Initiative. We will also be launching our 2022 ESG report in late May, which will include our progress against current environmental goals as well as our previously communicated diversity, equity and inclusion targets. Moving to our outlook. It is evident that challenges remain to the demand environment, and in some cases, such as U.S. housing and construction, they're weakening. Despite these anticipated headwinds, we remain confident that our margin recovery momentum will continue. We're executing against the shopping list of opportunities which we expect to contribute to strong year-over-year earnings growth in the second quarter and for the rest of 2023. This includes supporting our aerospace customers as they fulfill their strong order books, and we expect a second straight quarter of more than 10% sales volume growth year-over-year in this business. Also, as availability of raw materials returns to prepandemic levels, we expect our earnings to start benefiting from moderate deflation from recent historic inflation highs. As a reminder, aggregate raw material inflation since early 2021 remains at historically high levels. Additionally, our manufacturing is beginning to improve for multiyear production disruptions, and we expect this will generate efficiencies that will provide another earnings growth lever in the coming quarters. With respect to Europe, we are seeing coatings demand stabilize, albeit at lower levels, which will enable further year-over-year earnings growth, aided by the actioning against our restructuring program. PPG has leading architectural coatings positions in several countries in Europe. Once the economy begins to improve, this will provide an additional earnings growth lever. I'm also pleased with the growth prospects for our auto refinish, protective coatings and traffic solutions businesses. These end-use markets have proven to be more demand-resilient than in prior economic downturns, and a couple of these are positioned for further growth to support infrastructure investment in the United States. In China, we expect moderate and continuous sequential quarterly improvement in domestic demand as the year progresses. This will be more evident on a year-over-year basis given the pandemic-related restrictions in China last year during the second and fourth quarters. In summary, for the past few quarters, we have been conveying our strong conviction that various earnings growth catalysts would be activated. I am pleased that we have reached this inflection point and continue to have strong conviction, as reflected in our full year earnings guidance, that year-over-year earnings growth will continue, 2023. In addition, in this challenging macroeconomic period, you can also count on PPG's legacy of being highly focused on controlling the controllables, including managing our entire cost structure and optimizing our working capital. As I've begun my new role as CEO, I've challenged our team to focus on our advantages, prioritizing investments that will differentiate us and move the needle for our customers and our business. This includes advancing our digital capabilities throughout our businesses to improve our customers' productivity and further enhance our internal efficiencies. Our team is committed to accelerating earnings growth while preserving the strengths of PPG's legacy. Thank you for your continued confidence in PPG. This concludes our prepared remarks. And Elliot, would you please open the line for questions?Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question today comes from Duffy Fischer from Goldman Sachs.Patrick Duffy FischerCongrats on a nice quarter. My question is mostly around the sequential EPS and how that relates to history. So if you stripped out 2020 and 2021 and looked at the 6 years before that and last year, Q1 to Q2 has averaged up about $0.48 with all of those years being above $0.40. And at the midpoint of your guide, you're only up $0.28 this year. So how do you match those 2? And then a similar question for first half versus second half. If you just use the midpoint of your guide, your second half is down $0.80 versus the first half. But in those same 7 years, if you look historically, it's averaged down about $0.30. So could be conservatism, could be something different in the seasonality, maybe something around the loading of Walmart. But can you just kind of walk through why we should expect a lower -- or why we shouldn't expect kind of the higher number of history to prevail?Timothy M. KnavishSure, Duffy. First of all, let me give you a few high-level comments, and I'll let Vince fill in the gaps. On the Q1 to Q2 step up, we definitely had some onetimers in Q1. Notably, the Walmart load-in, we had some insurance settlements related to past storms. We have a promotion for Comex Easter sales every year, more of those sales were pulled into Q1 than normal. And that's a big piece of the Q1 to Q2, and I'm sure Vince can give you more details. As for the rest of the year, we are cautious on volume for a number of reasons. Slower China opening of manufacturing. We're cautious on U.S. housing for the second half of the year. We're cautious on global industrial. So those are some of the few high levels. And Vince, do you want to add a few details?Vincent J. MoralesNo. I think we quantified the Walmart business. The load-in for us in Q1 was about $40 million. Again, just a little more color. The Comex business has a very large Easter campaign. The Easter campaign was split last year between Q1 and Q2. This year, most of the load occurred in Q1, so we're not going to have that traditional step up. And we did see really good activity in Europe auto. And again, our prediction is, while that's still going to be a very strong business, Q1 was a very strong European auto.OperatorOur next question comes from Ghansham Panjabi from Baird.Ghansham PanjabiCongrats on all the progress to start the year. I guess, first off on auto refinish and your outlook for directional improvement in 2Q. Is that just a function of comparability from the year-ago period and the China reopening? And also going back to some of the volume weakness in Europe and North America for auto refinish in the first quarter. Can you just give us some more color on the customer order pattern timing that you called out?Timothy M. KnavishYes. Sure. Thanks for the question, Ghansham. Let me start off by saying I have full confidence -- high confidence in our auto refinish business globally going forward as well as over the last several quarters because our key-to-key value proposition is best in class.What you see in refinish, if you look at Q4, then to Q1, then to what we're saying for Q2, this business, because of the two-step distribution, you really need to look at it over a multi-quarter basis just because it's hard sometimes to project the order pattern of our independent distribution. So I would look at Q1 in that light and rather look at, instead of an individual quarter, look at it over multiple quarters. But we have strong backlogs across the body shops, and it's really driven by two things other than paint. It's driven by parts shortages and it's driven by labor shortages, so those backlogs remain. And so this actual sellout to the collision industry remains strong. There's just some fluctuation in independent distribution ordering patterns.OperatorOur next question comes from Stephen Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.Stephen V. ByrneI'd like to drill in a little bit on your commercial strategy in U.S. architectural. It seems like you have a similar offering now at the independent hardware stores and Walmarts with this Glidden platform. And between those and The Home Depot arrangement and your own stores, it seems like it could be nearly 10,000 locations. My question for you is how would you split your sales in architectural paint in the U.S. between those various buckets? And where do you think that could go in the next few years? And could this cannibalize sales in your own stores?Timothy M. KnavishThanks, Steve. Great question. So we don't expect cannibalization. Let me explain a little bit about what we're doing. Glidden is by far our strongest and best-known DIY brand in the U.S. And historically, despite that strong brand strength, we lacked distribution. So obviously, we partner with The Home Depot with Glidden. We're now partnering with Walmart with Glidden. And we've always partnered with our independent dealers with Glidden. One of your points. Typically, we don't carry Glidden at our own company stores. So think about it as big box home improvement plus Walmart plus private dealers. The type of customer that buys paint at Walmart is very different than the type of customer that buys paint at The Home Depot. And so what we're really doing with these recent moves is expanding distribution and providing access to the strong DIY brand across multiple different types of consumers, multiple different price points of consumers and expanded geography. So that's really what we're doing here, and there's very little conflict between those 3 pieces and certainly very little cannibalism.OperatorOur next question comes from John McNulty from BMO.John Patrick McNultyTim, your first quarter margins, I don't think we've seen them this high other than maybe twice in the last 15 years, and that's even with adding traffic solutions, which I think should be dragging it down in 1Q. So I guess, one, where can we see margins go this year for PPG? And then what are some of the big factors? Is it all price versus raws? How should we think about mix, some of the efficiency measures you were speaking to? I guess can you help us to frame that a bit?Timothy M. KnavishWell, we're on -- as you've heard me say, John, we are on a margin recovery journey. And as happy as we are with the 380 basis point improvement, we're pleased with that progress, but we are not satisfied with where we are. We are not back to historical levels. We've still got more work to do, and we're confident that we will continue to see improvement. This, frankly, is our second straight quarter of year-over-year margin improvement. We expect Q2 to be the third straight quarter of year-over-year margin improvement. But we've got more work to do here. And it's both on the value capture side and getting paid for the products and services that we deliver. It's mix driven. And certainly, we've begun to see some moderation on the cost side.Vincent J. MoralesJohn, this is Vince. Just to get some more numeric guidance here. We're down still 150, 200 basis points versus our prior high-water marks, which we hit several times and -- several times in the past 10 years in the first quarter. So we have other levers. Tim mentioned one in the opening comments. We're still not back to where we want to be on manufacturing. Our volumes on a multiyear basis are still down. And again, cost control, which is a legacy here, we feel we could do better. So we still have multiple levers to get back to prior high-water marks and then eventually hoping to exceed those.OperatorOur next question comes from Christopher Parkinson from Mizuho.Christopher S. ParkinsonCan you just offer a little bit more color about what's embedded in both your aerospace and refinish guidance levels? Just how you're thinking about it for the year? Does aerospace include Boeing's further build rates? 737 MAX in China? Widebody? Some color on that. And then on the refinish side, just any color about how you think the body shop world, specifically in the U.S., is still dealing with labor constraints and so on and so forth. You had some pretty optimistic -- or actually, bullish comments for the second quarter. It'd just be great to know what's underscoring that in particular versus '19 levels.Timothy M. KnavishSure. Thanks, Chris. So on the aero side, you mentioned a number of things there, and the answer would be yes to all of them. We have a number of positive catalysts there. The China reopening, even though China -- international China widebody is still well below 2019 levels, domestic travel alone drives a lot of MRO activity for us. So that, we expect to continue to grow. You mentioned one of our big OEM customers. You've seen their 2023 output so far is much better. So that certainly helps. We've got -- the backlog continues to grow on both OEM and aftermarket, particularly on the MRO side. So -- or I'm sorry, on the transparency side. So we've got some catch-up of that backlog built into our planning. And the military segment remains very strong. So a lot of what we've got built in is the underlying demand strength, but also our ability to continue to increase our output because right now, in many parts of our business in aerospace, we can sell whatever we can produce. On the refinish side. Again, you have to take out these quarter-to-quarter fluctuations. Fundamentally, the collision business is still very strong. And so if the body shops are able to get more cars through because they're able to improve supply on parts, improve labor, we're in a much better supply situation because most of our supply dynamics are behind us. So we're really poised to capture whatever throughput output -- I'm sorry, throughput increase they're able to achieve, which they're highly motivated to do because their backlogs are so strong.Vincent J. MoralesJust to put some numbers to the -- this is Vince. Just to put some numbers to the China aerospace opportunity. International flights to and from China are down about 70% versus prepandemic still. Domestic travel in China is down about 20% versus prepandemic. Big -- obviously big market for all the aerospace players. And again, for us, that's all opportunity in both OEM and our aftermarket business.OperatorOur next question comes from David Begleiter from Deutsche Bank.David L. BegleiterTim, just on raw materials. What's embedded in your second half guidance in terms of declines year-over-year? And just on pricing, where are you still implementing price increases?Timothy M. KnavishSure. Thanks, David. On raw materials, well, let's start with -- the high-level statement is we expect to continue to see moderation as we move through the year. And what we actually realized in Q1 was essentially flat on a year-over-year basis. We expect Q2 to be about low single digits down on a year-over-year basis. And beyond that, we expect continued further moderation, but hard to quantify the scale of that at this point because there's still so many moving parts. But that's what I would say on the raw material side.On the pricing side, we did achieve more pricing in Q1. We were up 8% in total. About 70% of that is carryover. We were able to achieve some additional pricing in the quarter on an incremental basis. The vast majority of that being in the Performance Coatings segment. So I think as we move forward on price, we'll comp -- we'll start to comp higher increases as we move through the year from last year, so the increments will be smaller. But we are highly confident that for Q2, Q3, Q4, we will print positive price numbers.Vincent J. MoralesAnd just a reminder, we're still at a 40-year high inflation rates in our sector, even with this moderation.OperatorOur next question comes from Jeff Zekauskas from JPMorgan.Jeffrey John ZekauskasTwo-part question. So first, when you look at your auto OEM prices in the quarter, were they comparable to the industrial segment in general? That is, industrial was up, I don't know, maybe 8%? Is that what auto OEM prices did? Or were they higher or were they lower? Can you calibrate that? And second...Vincent J. MoralesJeff, they were certainly in line. Sorry, go ahead.Jeffrey John ZekauskasYes. I'm puzzled that your raw materials were flat year-over-year in that oil was $100 a barrel in the first quarter of '22 and propylene was $0.60 a pound. And I believe that maybe your raw materials probably peaked in the second quarter of 2022 and then came down. So like where is the inflation coming from? Or there must be something -- it seems to be unusual about your raw material basket in that it should be lower than where it was in the first quarter of last year, at least from an outside perspective.Timothy M. KnavishJeff, I'm going to take the auto question. So yes, auto OEM was consistent with segment pricing, which was about that 8%. And again, I want to remind you, the vast majority of that is carryover, especially in that business. And the new pricing there, much of that was actually negotiated last year. And part of the part of the process in negotiations with auto OEMs is magnitude and timing of implementation. So that's the answers to your first question. Vince, do you want to take raws?Vincent J. MoralesYes. Jeff, I think when you look at our raw materials, one of the things we've talked about the last several quarters was pulling that through our inventory. And if you look, we ended the year -- we talked about this in the back half of last year. We ended Q3 and Q4 with abnormally high inventory balances. We were buying raw materials where we -- when we can get them. So we have to work that inventory down. If you look at our inventory balance actually in Q1, it's still elevated relative to what our expectations are. So it's really a matter of how we're pulling those prior purchases through our inventory and into our cost of sales. We still have some, again, inventory to work down as we get into the peak season here in Q2. And we'll see some more realized benefit once we are able to work through that inventory.Timothy M. KnavishYes. Jeff, to your basket question, our raw material basket is largely what it's always been. But there are parts of that raw material basket that we're still seeing year-over-year inflation in. Pigments, additives, extenders, inorganics, a number of items where we're still seeing year-over-year increase.OperatorOur next question comes from Vincent Andrews from Morgan Stanley.Vincent Stephen AndrewsI'm wondering if you could just help us better understand how March went. It sounds like, obviously, it was stronger than you expected, particularly in the back half of the quarter. In which particular areas of your business did that strength came in? And if there was any particular driving force for it and whether it's continued into April so far? To the extent you have data you can share.Timothy M. KnavishSure. Sure, Vincent. The parts of our business that were very strong as we moved through March, I would say, our aerospace business; our auto business, particularly Europe auto; and as Vince alluded to earlier, our Comex business was stronger than we had expected as we saw more pull-forward of the Easter campaign.Vincent J. MoralesAnd just a reminder, when we said this in January, March is typically 40%, 50% of the quarter in terms of the size of the quarter financially. So again, when we have a strong March, it's very helpful.OperatorOur next question comes from Josh Spector from UBS.Joshua David SpectorSo I just want to poke on the guidance again for the year. So if I think about some of the onetimers in 1Q, if I say they're maybe $0.20 in EPS, seasonally adjust first half, implies the year's kind of at the midpoint of your guidance for the year about, $7.10. No incremental benefit from raw materials. And the areas where you talk about volume weakness, China housing, industrial, maybe we're talking about 20%, 25% of your sales, but you're optimistic on auto OEM, refinish, aero, which more than offsets that. So I mean, is it a fair take to look at this and say, there's really minimal benefit of raw materials in the second half, similar benefit of pricing, and you're just like pushing on where volumes are today? Or is that an entirely wrong way to look at it?Timothy M. KnavishWell, on our second half guide, first thing I'll say is it's still 10% EPS growth Y-o-Y in an extremely challenging environment. And so I just want to lead with that. And most of the concern for second half is more volume focused. We're continued slowdown, U.S. housing. We've got uncertainty on the general industrial side. And really, uncertainty on the pace of recovery of industrial/manufacturing in China. So those are really the key drivers to the second half.Vincent J. MoralesYes, this is Vince, I'll just add. Again, it's still cloudy when we look at the economy. We do know that most countries are raising interest rates. There's typically a delay between interest rate increases and consumer effect. We're seeing that in different parts of our portfolio around the world. So we just remain somewhat cautious on the delayed effect on that interest rate increase environment.As Tim mentioned, I'll echo, we're not sure about the pace of recovery in China. We do feel it's going to be -- our guide includes a moderate recovery, a continuing, elongated recovery. That's beneficial from our perspective because we don't see that creating more commodity inflation, but that -- the pace of that recovery is still uncertain at this time.OperatorOur next question comes from Aleksey Yefremov from [KeyCorp].Aleksey V. YefremovIn architectural in the U.S., can you share any data or sentiment from Pro paint contractors? How is the backlog changing here?Timothy M. KnavishYes. Backlogs have remained surprisingly robust despite everything you see in the news and despite what's happening in construction, driven by labor shortages primarily. So the backlogs remain strong. And for our Pro business, the omnichannel of our Pro business was up almost 10% for the quarter. So we are seeing continued good activity in the Pro space in architectural United States.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Sison from Wells Fargo.Michael Joseph SisonNice start to the year. Tim, just curious, in terms of the second half with the 10% EPS growth, I apologize if I missed this, but what do you expect for volumes? What's sort of the range of outcomes for the company? Is it down, flat, maybe even up on easy comps? Just curious.John BrunoMike, this is John. I'll take that one. So as Tim pointed, there's a few factors that we're considering in the volumes forecast that's in the guide. I would say that it's down slightly in our second half guidance, Mike, overall, based on all the feedback that Tim provided.OperatorOur next question comes from Peter Clark from Societe Generale.Peter Anthony John ClarkJust looking at your #1 priority of getting your margin back, and particularly on the Industrial Coatings, because obviously, you were peaking at over 18%. I know there's been mix changes. You bought in lower-margin acquisitions that you're working on. But if I play with your full year guidance, you're sort of inferring this margin recovering to about 14%, ex-amortization. So you're still 400 basis points adrift. I understand it's challenging, volumes are still not great, but is there anything structurally that stops you getting back to that sort of level in the next few years that you were achieving back in '16 and '17 level?Timothy M. KnavishYes. Thanks for the question. There's nothing structurally preventing us from getting back to those levels. The big driver for us, I would say 2 things. Number one, volume. Volume is still down significantly from the time periods that you referenced, and so just the leverage from that. And then the other one is operating efficiencies. All of the supply chain disruptions that we've had over the last couple of years, our manufacturing costs have not been at benchmark. And you heard that we did see some improvement in that in Q1, and we're expecting further improvement as we move forward. So there's nothing structurally preventing us from getting back to peak margins in that segment.OperatorOur next question comes from Arun Viswanathan from RBC.Arun Shankar ViswanathanJust a couple of questions around margins. It looks like your margins were up at around 13% level for EBIT in the first quarter. Do you see continued growth there? And what kind of volume growth would you expect to get that back into the mid-teens to high-teens level?Timothy M. KnavishWell, we absolutely expect to see continued margin growth. Arun, as I mentioned earlier, we're confident that the next couple of quarters will show continued year-over-year margin improvement. The volume question, as John mentioned, we're going to have volume challenges likely. Potentials for upside. But our base case is that it will be a tougher-volume second half.Vincent J. MoralesYes, Arun, this is Vince. If you look at some of the nearer-term levers we have, the rich mix we benefited from in Q1, we expect to continue against some of our key technology businesses, aerospace, automotive. Tim mentioned about the strength of the Mexican economy. We have leading positions in Mexico in several of our businesses, including Comex. And as Tim mentioned, we're starting to see early signs of manufacturing optimization. Still a long -- we still have a long way to go there, but that's something internally we're managing. And as I mentioned earlier, we have laser focus on our costs, especially with the volume outlook and the concern around consumer spending that I talked about earlier.OperatorOur next question comes from Kevin McCarthy from VRP.Kevin William McCarthyA few questions on your auto OEM coatings business. What are you baking in for global builds in terms of your annual EPS guide? And would you also comment on any meaningful share shifts by region? And how the EV penetration is playing out for PPG.Timothy M. KnavishSure. Thanks, Kevin. Our base case on auto OEM for the year on builds is low single digits with potential for upside, depending what happens with a whole number of things around affordability in China. But our base case is low single digits. We have not seen a huge amount of share shift. We did see some in China. As we were executing our margin recovery strategy, we did lose some of the lower-margin business. But what's historically happened there, Kevin, is they ultimately come back for a number of reasons. And third part of your question was around the EVs. What I could say on EVs is we're extremely pleased with our progress there. We're winning on EVs where EVs are winning, which is China. So we're doing well with the #1 China EV player, and they're doing well. If you look at builds now of EVs, they were up. Over 10% of global builds now are EVs. And in China, which is where we're having most of our success, over 20% now of all vehicles sold in China are EVs. So we like what we're seeing from a penetration standpoint, and we're pleased with our progress, but still a lot more to do there.Vincent J. MoralesJust to add. Again, we came into the year with a low to mid-single-digit projection on global builds for the year. Q1 was -- for the industry was 5%. So Q1 outperformed the initial projections for the industry.OperatorOur next question comes from Michael Leithead with Barclays.Michael James LeitheadReal briefly, just on North American architectural, there's obviously a few moving pieces with all the wins you flagged. So I guess, high level, what do you assume or you think the industry is growing at this year versus what do you think PPG is going to be able to grow at?Timothy M. KnavishI think it's -- the reality is these three in totality is going to be soft, driven by what's happened on 2 fronts. Number one, housing. And number two, you still have some post-COVID hangover from the DIY side due to what everybody did, painting their houses during that period. So industry-wide, that's what we're seeing. For PPG, we've got a number of programs, as you say, with obviously our Walmart win, the launch of The Home Depot Pro program. Our mix, we're not as big on new build as we are on construction and maintenance. So we're thinking about it a little bit better than the rest of the industry. But driven by housing and driven by DIY, we expect this overall to be a challenging year in architectural U.S.Vincent J. MoralesYes. And Mike, just another reminder here. We're -- paint is typically the last part of the cycle. So as housing starts have come down the past several quarters, we're still working off those backlogs from a paint perspective. If you look at the mixture of housing starts, roughly 60% are single-family. Those have come down already. I'm not sure if they bottomed yet or not. There's some positive signs that they at least flattened. If you look at multifamily, multifamily is a still a very high record. And those will be delivered late this year or maybe early next year. And we do think there's an air pocket after that due to the credit liquidity, et cetera. Again, 60% single-family, 40% multifamily. So we haven't seen the negative effects yet in multifamily.OperatorOur next question comes from Laurence Alexander with Jefferies.Laurence AlexanderCould you just briefly flesh out your outlook for U.S. infrastructure? And particularly kind of sort of your assumptions for the back half of the year. And the landscape for -- or the pipeline for potential bolt-on M&amp;A. And particularly, like how you're thinking about opportunities in the emerging market.Timothy M. KnavishYes. Sure, Laurence. On the outlook for infrastructure, we're quite positive on that as the infrastructure spending is starting and there's a lot more projects in the queue. And we have a number of portfolio positions that should help us there. Our Protective Coatings business, some of our Industrial Coatings business and certainly, our traffic solutions business. So we're positive on that ramping up as we move through not only this year but into the future.Vincent J. MoralesYes, Laurence, on the M&amp;A environment. Yes, I'd still say it's somewhat active, not consistent. Historically, it's been more active. There's certainly some deals or some files that are percolating of the small kind of vintage. So there's still an issue, if you're a buyer or a seller, coming up with a price based on the past 12-month financials. Again, we said many times, we would expect a few deals to get done in our space each year, and that's our same expectation this year.OperatorOur next question comes from Laurent Favre from Exane BNP Paribas.Laurent Guy FavreTwo very quick questions, please. The first one is on manufacturing. Can you size that opportunity for us? And is it just about China where you see the COVID issues in the early part of Q1? Or do you also see an opportunity in Europe and U.S.? And the second question was just on marine and protective. It sounds like that was a bit a surprise for you in Q1. You thought it would be down, was up. I'm just wondering if you can share a few thoughts there.John BrunoLaurent, this is John. I'll start with the manufacturing one, and Tim will take the second part. So if you go back to January of '22, we talked about significant manufacturing challenges we had due to supply disruptions in the fourth quarter of '21. We quoted about a $0.20 EPS impact. That was the height of the impacts. And every quarter since, we've had some type of negativity. Now this quarter, the first quarter of 2023, we were close to being breakeven on a year-over-year basis, and we expect that to get better as we go forward. So the objective is for us to claw back all of the inefficiencies that we've had in the last 5 quarters.Timothy M. KnavishYes, I'll take the protective and marine side. The way I think about this business right now is it's well positioned for infrastructure, near-shoring, energy, a lot of the investments that are happening around those areas. And also in marine, where we have really pivoted our focus to marine aftermarket, which is doing well. So when you add those all together, we were up high single digits in Q1, and we expect to be up mid-single digits again in Q2. So that's one of the businesses that we're pretty bullish on.OperatorOur next question comes from Frank Mitsch from Fermium Research.Frank Joseph MitschCongrats on the start to the year. Vince, you took a $144 million charge due to the pension benefit obligation. I'm curious as to what sort of future cost benefit might we expect from that action? And Tim, obviously, very impressive progress on price. And your expectation is that you're going to have positive price for the balance of the year. But as we see deflation from record raws, any concerns on potential price givebacks in any of your businesses?Vincent J. MoralesThanks, Frank. This is Vince. Yes, just a reminder, we do have a step up in 2023, a noncash step-up as it relates to pension expense, fairly significant, $10 million to $15 million a quarter. We did annuitize a portion of our pension plan. The benefit from that from an expense perspective is fairly minimal. It's about $1 million or $2 million a quarter. So nothing sizable relative to the step-up we've had coming into the year.Timothy M. KnavishYes. And Frank, on price, so on protective, we expect very little, if any, any price givebacks as we -- I'm sorry. I said protective, I meant performance. On performance in total, we expect very little giveback as we move through the year. On industrial, I'll remind, about 30% of our industrial segment business, the pricing is based on index arrangements. So if there is raw material deflation, those indexes will kick in, but there's a delay of multiple quarters depending on the contract. So that's more of a '24 issue for us. And beyond that, more generally, I'd say, we -- obviously, we watch this very closely every day. And churn would be our primary indicator if there's something we need to act upon. Our competitors are facing the same basic cost structure and cost inputs that we are. And we watch our churn. And to date, we've seen very little churn, as I mentioned earlier, other than a little bit in Asia.OperatorOur next question comes from John Roberts from Credit Suisse.John Ezekiel E. RobertsWhere within the performance segment were you able to get additional price? Or was that mix with the aerospace business just improving in the mix?Timothy M. KnavishWell, they were both factors. The mix element part of it was our aerospace business, no doubt. As the first part on where we're able to get price, we got incremental price in almost all parts of our performance segment, so architectural, refinish. And I'd just remind that, while we are seeing moderation in some raw material inflation, we're still seeing inflation in wages and indirects and some raw material categories. So I'd say that incremental price was largely in response to incremental inflation.Vincent J. MoralesYes, John, this is Vince. Just for clarity, we -- as we break out these numbers for you guys externally, we have price separate. We put in business mix, regional mix, product mix. We combine that with volume. And if you look at both our original guide and our updated guide or updated final numbers, we benefited from incremental pricing, stand-alone pricing, so invoice pricing. Secondarily and separately, we benefited from regional mix. Tim mentioned some of our business, including Latin America, were higher than our expectations. We benefited from business mix. Some of our higher technology businesses were higher than our expectation, as we called out in both of our releases. And we benefited within business from product mix. So we hit, I think, the 3 big categories for us.OperatorOur final question today comes from Jaideep Pandya from On Field Research.Jaideep Mukesh PandyaFirst one, to go back to the EV point. Could you just give us some color on what is the content per vehicle for ICE versus EV? And in your top EV customers, are they all sort of the top 5 Chinese companies? That's my first question. And the second question is on the Industrial Coatings, where you alluded to weakness in the U.S. Have you seen sort of the destocking coming to an end in Q1? Or are you expecting further destocking or weaker volumes from the coil extrusion categories in the U.S., especially in Q2 and Q3?Timothy M. KnavishThanks, Jaideep. I'm going to go backwards with how you asked them. Just destocking, the -- our industrial segment businesses, there's not a tremendous amount of inventory held at our customers. And so any significant destocking, whether it's -- frankly, whether it's industrial or performance, is largely behind us. But the softening that we mentioned in general industrial and in particular here in the U.S. is across a couple of key segments. One of them you already mentioned, and that's coil because that's largely tied to construction. But we've also seen softness in some consumer-facing areas, electronic materials, kitchen and bakeware appliance. Fortunately, there's some positives offsetting some of that as well on HD -- heavy-duty equipment, transportation, powder. But in general, those were the segments that were a bit soft. On your EV question. So the content per vehicle, unfortunately, there's not a simple one-number answer to do that because it depends upon the different technologies that are adopted by each of the OEMs. But what I will tell you is that the potential content per vehicle for functional and specialty protective coatings is significant and in the same scale as the content per vehicle of conventional layering systems, which can -- that can range between $90 to $125 a vehicle. You had a question embedded in there about who are we working with, who are we successful with in China. Generally speaking, we're working with all of the OEMs, whether it's Chinese or non-Chinese. But we have had most of our commercial success thus far with the #1 player in EVs in China.Vincent J. MoralesJaideep, this is Vince. I want to go back to your industrial question and maybe broaden it a little bit. If you think about PPG, 2022 was a difficult year. We had significant exposure in Europe, where we saw the geopolitical items really affect our volumes. As everybody is fully aware, China had multiple months of shutdowns in 2022. And the U.S. was one of our most stable businesses. And Mexico and Latin America continued to grow. If you fast forward into 2023, we feel Europe stabilized, and we're able to then put our cost stewardship on that. We feel China and Asia is going to grow. So 2 big pieces of our portfolio pointing in the right direction as it compared to last year. And we still feel very strong about Latin America and grow, and we're seeing some softness in the U.S. in industrial, certainly in the construction markets. But we're offsetting the majority of that with aerospace and automotive, protective, as Tim mentioned. So again, I think for us, we had a difficult 2022, and we're lapping some of that in 2023. The only thing we see softening is really those pockets in the U.S.OperatorThere are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn the call back over to John Bruno.John BrunoThank you, Elliot. We appreciate everyone's continued interest and confidence in PPG. This concludes our First Quarter Earnings Call.OperatorThis concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.]"

QuoteSegment ReviewThe Performance Coatings segment’s first-quarter revenues increased 2% year over year to $2,628 million. This modest increase is driven by higher selling prices in all businesses that more than offset reduced sales volumes, the impact of divestitures, the exit of business in Russia and unfavorable foreign currency translations.Revenues from the Industrial Coatings segment totaled $1,752 million, an increase of 1% year over year, driven by higher prices that offset lower sales volumes, unfavorable currency and the exit of business in Russia. Sales of Automotive OEM coatings increased on higher volumes and prices.FinancialsPPG ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $1,426 million, up around 48.5% year over year. Long-term debt was $7,082 million, up 3.6%.Corporate expenses rose by $15 million in the reported quarter to $70 million. The increase is attributed to higher non-cash pension expenses. The company also realized around $15 million of cost savings from acquisition-related synergies and business restructuring programs in the quarter.OutlookPPG projects adjusted earnings of $6.95-$7.25 per share for 2023. The prediction excludes amortization expense, non-cash pension settlement charge, benefit from insurance recovery and costs related to earlier approved and communicated business restructuring.Factoring in current global economic activities, geopolitical issues in Europe and higher interest rates in most developed countries, the company expects sales volumes in second-quarter 2023 to be flat with the potential for slight improvement or decrease of a low single-digit percentage year over year.

That is because the Jun 16, 2023 $2.50 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today.What is Implied Volatility?Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy.What do the Analysts Think?Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for Goldman Sachs shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, Goldman Sachs is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Sell) in the Financial - SBIC &amp; Commercial Industry industry that ranks in the Top 8% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 60 days, two analysts have increased their earnings estimates for the current quarter, while no analyst has revised the estimate downward. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 52 cents per share to 54 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about Goldman Sachs right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected.Looking to Trade Options?Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

(GSBD) a Buy Now?",Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-goldman-sachs-bdc-130001515.html,1682082001,STORY,"['GS', 'GSBD']","[Goldman Sachs BDC (GSBD) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Shares of this specialty finance company have returned +0.1% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Financial - SBIC &amp; Commercial Industry industry, to which Goldman Sachs BDC belongs, has gained 2.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.Earnings Estimate RevisionsRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Goldman Sachs BDC is expected to post earnings of $0.54 per share, indicating a change of +10.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.14 points to a change of -4.5% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has remained unchanged.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $2.05 indicates a change of -4.4% from what Goldman Sachs BDC is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Goldman Sachs BDC.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for GSBD _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.For Goldman Sachs BDC, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $107.34 million indicates a year-over-year change of +37.1%. For the current and next fiscal years, $428.08 million and $402.24 million estimates indicate +19.8% and -6% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryGoldman Sachs BDC reported revenues of $106.5 million in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.2%. EPS of $0.65 for the same period compares with $0.48 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $102.02 million, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +4.4%. The EPS surprise was +27.45%.Over the last four quarters, Goldman Sachs BDC surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Goldman Sachs BDC is graded F on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Goldman Sachs BDC. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

MAT is scheduled to report first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 26, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33.3%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter bottom line is pegged at a loss of 25 cents per share against adjusted earnings of 8 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $750 million, suggesting a decline of 28% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Factors at PlayMattel’s first-quarter 2023 performance is likely to have been affected by a decline in North America gross billings. This decline is subject to the dismal performance of Infant, Toddler, and Preschool (including Fisher-Price and Thomas &amp; Friends), Dolls (including Barbie), Action Figures, Building Sets, Games and Other. Also, the persisting coronavirus-related risks are expected to have caused supply-chain disruptions along with dismal store traffic on account of travel and other local restrictions like retail closures in China.In first-quarter 2023, our model predicts North America and international revenues to decline 29.4% and 27.6%, year over year to $450.3 million and $292.4 million, respectively. On the other hand, North America gross billings are expected to decline 30.5% in the quarter to be reported.Mattel, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMattel, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMattel, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Mattel, Inc. QuoteThe bottom line is likely to have been affected by inventory obsolescence expense, higher input cost inflation, unfavorable fixed cost absorption and higher royalty costs. These costs are expected to have negatively impacted the company’s operations and hurt margins in the to-be-reported quarter. For the first quarter, our model predicts adjusted gross margin to decline 450 points year over year.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Mattel this time around.

First, we delivered very solid year-on-year growth at a magnitude lasting more than a decade ago. Geographically, year-on-year growth rates in North America and internationally were comparable. More importantly, the rate of change is tipping more in favor of the international market, where sequentially we experienced the smallest seasonal decline in recent times. Collectively, our Core divisions grew year-on-year by more than 30% and expanded operating margins by more than 300 basis points. We continue to position the Core for long-term success with significant contract wins and technology innovations that improve efficiency and lower carbon emissions. A great example is EcoShield, a geopolymer-based, cement-free well integrity system and one of our latest Transition Technologies launched earlier this quarter. You will find many examples of these contract wins and the performance impact of our new technologies in today's press release. In digital, we maintained strong growth momentum and also secured more contract wins. At the division level, the amount of year-on-year revenue growth in digital was somewhat masked by significantly lower EPS revenue due to production interruption in Ecuador and lower project revenue in the Palliser asset in Canada. Additionally, digital continues to help us elevate our efficiency and margin performance in the Core as we deploy this solution at scale in our global operations. And in New Energy, we continue to make progress across our portfolio, notably with new carbon capture and sequestration activities that raise our involvement to around 30 projects globally. CCS is recognized as one of the fastest-growing opportunity to reduce carbon emissions. And with the tailwinds from the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act and other initiatives around the world, we expect more projects to move forward to final investment decisions in the next 2 years. Finally, we are delivering on our commitment to increase returns to shareholders. During the quarter, we relaunched our share buyback program with repurchases totaling more than $200 million worth of shares. I would like to really thank the entire SLB team for their hard work and for delivering yet another successful quarter. Moving to the macro. We maintain a constructive multiyear growth outlook. Through the first quarter, the resilience, breadth and durability of the upcycle has only become more evident. I would like to take a few minutes to describe these factors. To begin, the underlying demand, investments and activity during this cycle are resilient despite short-term economic and demand uncertainties. The combination of energy security, the initiation of long-cycle projects and OPEC's policy sets the condition for a decoupling of the activity outlook for short-term demand uncertainties. Indeed, energy security remains a top priority for most countries and is driving structural investments that are governed primarily by national interest. The extent of these investments is resulting into a broad-ranging growth outlook, comprised predominantly of resilient long-cycle projects in the Middle East, the international offshore basins and in gas projects. Collectively, we expect these market segments to reach or exceed more than 2/3 of the total global upstream spend and support a long tail of resilient activity over the next few years. In parallel, the North America market, characterized by higher short-cycle exposure, is also set to benefit from positive demand outlook and supportive commodity pricing. However, this will be impacted by an anticipated activity plateau in the short term, which will subsequently be reflected in production volumes. Moving to the dimensions of breadth and duration. These are also best emphasized by the latest activity outlook for the Middle East and offshore market segments. Fundamentally, the pivot to both segments as anchors of supply growth is a defining attribute of this cycle. This is providing an unprecedented level of investment visibility and a scale that is setting many records. In the Middle East, the largest-ever investment cycle has now commenced. This will support ongoing capacity expansion projects over the next 4 years in both oil and gas. Consequently, this year, we expect to post our highest revenue ever in the Middle East, putting us on track to achieve our multiyear growth aspiration. Simultaneously, we are witnessing further activity expansion in the offshore market. Offshore activity continues to surprise to the upside with breadth and a diversity of opportunities across all major basins. In addition, the latest FID projections and industry reports indicate that the offshore sector is set for its highest growth in a decade with more than $200 billion in new projects through the next 2 years. This growth will be supported by three layers of activity. First, the resumption of infill and tieback activity in mature basins, which was very visible across Africa in 2022. This will continue to strengthen in multiple geographies from this year onward. Second, ongoing large development projects in both oil and gas that are ramping up and starting to scale. This is evident in Latin America, such as Guyana and Brazil, and in the Middle East, such as in Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar. And third, the resurgence of exploration and appraisal activity, which is starting to gather strong momentum in the existing basins and new frontiers. From West and South Africa to the East Mediterranean, we are starting to see exploration and appraisal at a pace that was unforeseen just a few months ago. Additionally, the activity pipeline continues to elongate with new licensing rounds and new blocks awarded. As a result, we believe that we'll continue to witness durable offshore investment for many years to come. Let me spend a couple of minutes highlighting what this means for SLB. As the cycle unfolds, the characteristics I have described continue to align with major strengths in our Core. This will support additional activity intensity for Well Construction; accelerated growth opportunity in Reservoir Performance through the return of exploration and appraisal activity; and further long-term growth potential for Production Systems. One such example is the TPAO Sakarya project in the Southern Black Sea offshore Turkey. This project involved all our Core divisions, supporting the development of a challenging subsea gas asset and a simultaneous construction of a gas production facility, demonstrating SLB's unique ability to integrate at scale from pore-to-process. Looking more in depth. Our Production Systems division is in a unique position as a long-cycle lever of growth for us with quarterly year-on-year results demonstrating our ability to fully harness its potential. We believe momentum is set to continue, benefiting from our strong market presence in the Middle East and in offshore basins. In this division, we anticipate cumulative bookings in the range of $10 billion to $12 billion in 2023, up significantly from 2022. We have taken a strong step forward towards this ambition with more than $3 billion bookings in the first quarter. And the outlook supports continued strong bookings through at least 2025. Overall, this will provide durable revenue growth and a significant installed base for services in the years to come. In this context, our exposure to the deepwater subsea market remains an essential component of our growth opportunity. And we continue to strengthen this part of our portfolio with much success. In subsea, we have grown 20% over the last 2 years and are already generating EBITDA margins in the high-teens, building on our technology, performance in execution and the depth of our processing portfolio. We expect strong momentum for this part of our business to be sustained through 2025 and beyond. To conclude, we are in the midst of a unique cycle with qualities that enhance the long-term outlook for industry, resilience, breadth and durability, all reinforced by a pivot to the Middle East, offshore, gas and return of E&amp;A. We could not ask for a better backdrop to execute our returns-focused strategy. During the early phase of this cycle, led by North America, our results have already demonstrated our ability to capture growth ahead of activity and expand margins visibly beyond pre-pandemic levels. Looking forward, we are positioned to fully harness the international and offshore momentum that is now underway and to further our margins expansion journey. In the quarters ahead, we'll continue to demonstrate our returns focus, capital discipline and commitment to shareholders' returns. I'm truly excited about the outlook for SLB. Next, I would like to comment on our progress over the shorter term. For the full year, our strong first quarter gives us renewed confidence in our financial ambitions for 2023. We are primed for revenue growth and margin expansion through the year, underpinned by a very solid international outlook. In North America, we still expect tangible market growth but at a lower rate than originally anticipated at the start of the year, mainly as a result of ongoing weakness in gas prices. Taken together, we expect the strong international growth to offset any weakness in North America, keeping our full year ambitions intact with year-on-year growth in excess of 15%, which should support adjusted EBITDA growth in the mid-20s. More specific to the second quarter. Directionally, we expect revenue to grow about mid- to high single digits with operating margins expanding by 50 to 100 basis points, driven by a seasonal rebound in the international markets. Growth will be led by Middle East and Asia area and continued momentum in the offshore markets. Building on this, we expect our second quarter adjusted EBITDA to reach new highs in this cycle, further expanding the earnings growth journey we initiated 11 quarters ago and taking another positive step towards achieving our full year ambitions. I will now turn the call over to Stephane.Stephane BiguetThank you, Olivier, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. First quarter earnings per share excluding charges and credits was $0.63. This represents an increase of $0.29 or 85% when compared to the first quarter of last year. In addition, during the first quarter, we recorded a $0.02 gain relating to the sale of all of our remaining shares in Liberty, which brought our GAAP EPS to $0.65. Overall, our first quarter revenue of $7.7 billion increased 30% year-on-year as the growth cycle continues to unfold. This represents the highest quarterly year-on-year increase in more than a decade. International revenue was up 29% year-on-year while North America increased 32%. Company-wide adjusted EBITDA margin for the first quarter was 23.1%. In absolute dollars, adjusted EBITDA increased 43% year-on-year. As a reminder, our ambition is for adjusted EBITDA to grow in percentage terms in the mid-20s for the full year of 2023. The first quarter was certainly a strong start towards achieving this goal. On a sequential basis, revenue decreased 2%, mostly driven by seasonally lower revenue in Asia and Russia as well as lower APS revenue in Ecuador. Russia represented approximately 5% of our consolidated Q1 revenue. Sequentially, our pretax segment operating margins declined 178 basis points, largely due to seasonality and lower APS revenue. From a year-on-year perspective, margins expanded 298 basis points with significant margin growth in three of our four divisions. Let me now go through the first quarter results for each division. First quarter Digital &amp; Integration revenue of $894 million decreased 12% sequentially with margins declining 8 percentage points to 30%. These decreases were primarily due to lower APS project revenue and seasonally lower digital and exploration data licensing sales. The APS revenue decline was mostly a result of a pipeline disruption in Ecuador that temporarily reduced production and lower commodity prices impacting our project in Canada. As a result of these issues, APS revenue declined year-on-year. But this effect was more than offset by strong digital growth, including a more than 50% increase in our cloud and edge solutions. Margins for the Digital &amp; Integration division are expected to improve in Q2 as the pipeline issue in Ecuador has been resolved and as digital sales will increase sequentially, in line with the usual seasonal trend. Reservoir Performance revenue of $1.5 billion decreased 3% sequentially while margins declined 207 basis points to 16.1%. These decreases were primarily due to seasonal activity reductions in Europe and Asia and lower revenue in Russia. Year-on-year, revenue grew 24% and margins increased 291 basis points, driven by strong growth internationally, both on land and offshore. Well Construction revenue of $3.3 billion increased 1% sequentially while margins of 20.6% decreased 44 basis points. However, year-on-year revenue grew 36% while margins expanded 444 basis points with very strong growth across all areas on higher activity, increased pricing and a favorable technology mix. Finally, Production Systems revenue of $2.2 billion was essentially flat sequentially and margins declined 148 basis points to 9.3% due to seasonality and the activity mix in Europe and Asia. Year-on-year, revenue increased 38% while margins expanded 217 basis points, driven by strong activity across all areas, led by Europe, Latin America and North America. Margins also improved compared to the first quarter of last year as supply chain and logistics constraints continued to ease. Now turning to our liquidity. Our net debt increased approximately $1 billion sequentially to $10.3 billion. During the quarter, we generated $330 million of cash flow from operations and negative free cash flow of $265 million, reflecting the seasonal increase in working capital we typically experience in the first quarter. This largely reflects the payout of our annual employee incentives and the buildup of working capital that will support our anticipated growth throughout the year. Our second quarter free cash flow is expected to be materially higher and to continue to increase into the third and fourth quarters. Capital investments inclusive of CapEx and investments in APS projects and exploration data were $595 million in the first quarter. For the full year, we are still expecting capital investments to be approximately $2.5 billion to $2.6 billion. During the quarter, we monetized our remaining investment in Liberty, which resulted in net proceeds of $137 million. We also spent $244 million, net of cash acquired, on acquisitions and investments in other businesses, the majority of which relates to the Gyrodata acquisition. Finally, we resumed our stock repurchase program and repurchased 4.4 million shares during the quarter for a total purchase price of $230 million. We will continue to repurchase shares in the coming quarters. And as previously announced, we are targeting to return a total of $2 billion to our shareholders this year between dividends and stock buybacks. I will now turn the conference call back to Olivier.Olivier Le PeuchThank you, Stephane. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we will open now the floor to your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) We go to the line of James West with Evercore ISI.James Carlyle WestOlivier, you and Stephane, you outlined kind of an unprecedented, quite frankly, amount of contract awards, amount of visibility into the cycle. And curious, as you talk to your customers now, what you see as the durability of those awards, given the global volatility in economies and things of that nature. How are you thinking about the next several years? How are you guys perceiving kind of the steadiness of these contract awards and their ability to continue to go forward, even if we were to have a recession or something like that, and how that would influence your revenue and results?Olivier Le PeuchNo, James, thank you. I think, indeed, I think we have highlighted, and I think in my prepared remarks, I shared the view that in the recent months and certainly in the last quarter, and I have been traveling in Asia, Middle East and South America, I have seen customers, I think, taking commitments and being ready to commit to the supply capacity and to the partnership they need to deploy and develop the assets going forward. As we believe this cycle is unique through, as we said, element of resilience by the nature of investment and growth rate, including the long-term capacity expansion committed in Middle East, including the large long-cycle elements that are growing in proportion, led by offshore deepwater coming back. The breadth, I think everywhere we go, every geo unit is seeing customer reaching out to mobilize resource, sometimes for short-cycle production enhancements, most of the time for development, commitment of assets and redevelopment expansion from infill to large-scale development. And durability is certainly improving. And duration of the cycle, I think, is improving as we see. Because beyond the Middle East, '27 targets of capacity expansion from -- for (inaudible) in the country. Other countries are targeting this towards the end of the decade. And here, I'm in the city in Brazil, Brazil has a clear ambition for 4 million barrel by 2030. And I've already committed up to 20 FPSO contract that will continue to build the pipeline of offshore activity subsea in particular going forward. So I'm very positive about the mix, if you like, of short cycle on production enhancements to address the anticipated supply risk and the commitment -- long commitment from Middle East, from deepwater and offshore operator to complement the long cycle. It's not to offset and not now take precedent over this short cycle and so turn -- as we indicated, a turn into the cycle towards international offshore and Middle East in particular. So that's where we are very confident.James Carlyle WestOkay. That's perfect, Olivier. And then a follow-up for me. In terms of pricing, international and offshore versus maybe North America, kind of what you're seeing there in terms of the level of concern, or maybe not concern but level of willingness to accept pricing increases. It seems to me like customers internationally and offshore are more looking at or concerned about availability of service capacity rather than what it actually costs.Olivier Le PeuchYes, I think the -- we are seeing pricing tailwinds. And we have seen pricing tailwinds in the global market for quite a few quarters and starting in North America. It has turned to international based on two things. First, indeed, securing capacity going forward, giving us -- giving -- considering the tight supply of equipment, unique technology, giving a level of sense of urgency to secure contract and elongating the contract. You have seen example of 9 years contract into the announcement we made today. And at the same time, I think performance matters. Performance matters to offshore operator. Performance matters for first gas, first oil. And there's a sense of urgency to accelerate the cycle. This is one of the priority. And technology integration also makes a difference and is recognized and is driving a pricing premium. So the combination of supply capacity, the combination of, I would say, a sense of urgency for -- and quest for performance integration and technology deployment is driving pricing tailwinds that are serving us very well.OperatorNext, we go to David Anderson with Barclays.J. David AndersonSo question on kind of the duration of the cycle in your Core business. Well Construction is obviously a big part of that. I was hoping maybe you could talk about the pace of Well Construction that you see in front of you this year and where you should see the greatest uptick in activity and kind of the greatest shift in technology as well. I noticed that North America was up 9% sequentially, which is a bit of a surprise. But where does that Middle East ramp-up fit in here? And kind of also a similar question to what James asked, a question of capacity. If I'm one of your customers, what am I most worried about today? Is it Well Construction? Is that kind of the -- I would have to think that has to be kind of towards the top of the list. But that -- if you can sort of help us understand that a little bit.Olivier Le PeuchYes. No, I think you are correct. I think the supply of high-performance equipment in the Well Construction domain is under stretch today. I think we are working very closely with our customers to prioritize equipment, prioritize technology application and use integration, use digital to help deliver the performance they expect. So there is a stretch indeed in this. But going forward, I think we are committing the resource when we see the returns to be accretive to our margins and align with our expectation and ambition to continue to expand margins. So where we see the most activity, clearly, this year is an uptick. And this will be the case as sequentially next quarter is in Middle East and offshore, I think a combination of an integrated contract we have in offshore with relatively complex assets on occasion that demands a lot of technology deployments. And the intensity of activity in Middle East, that is a mix of short-cycle and long-cycle development project, this combination is unique and I think will be pulling more resource, more equipment, more technology and will drive revenue forward up.J. David AndersonAnd was the North America uptick, was that more offshore-driven than onshore this quarter?Olivier Le PeuchYes, it was, indeed, absolutely. I think offshore is not only international, I think offshore is happening in North America. North America as Northeast Canada, Alaska offshore and Gulf of Mexico, the combination of which is set to grow and outpace this year, the -- I would say, the U.S. land and North America land activity. So we are also getting the benefit of our fit-for-basin success in North America that continues to hold and help us maintain, grow our share and come on a premium on pricing.J. David AndersonAnd then Olivier, in the D&amp;I business, APS obviously impacted the performance this quarter. I was wondering maybe if you could kind of pull back a little bit and help us understand how the digital business is performing. I think the goal is to hit a $3 billion revenue target. Wondering if you can kind of tell us where we are now in terms of that run rate. And in order to hit those targets, I'm just curious, is that about your existing customers using digital more? Is it adding more apps to DELFI? Is it adding more customers? Is it all of the above? Maybe help us understand a little bit more...Olivier Le PeuchAll of the above.J. David AndersonI had a feeling you would say that.Olivier Le PeuchIndeed. But I think, indeed, Dave, I think first, in this quarter, obviously, the growth. And we have seen growth rate in digital that is aligned with our expectations, aligned with our ambition to double revenue from 2021 to 2025. We have seen, as Stephane mentioned during his prepared remarks, that the new technology edge and cloud is growing at more than 50%, continuing on the trajectory that we have set in the last couple of years. And we don't see any sign of this slowing down.And indeed, expansion will come from multiple dimensions, obviously getting more consumption from the existing customer we have. And we are today deploying one of the largest contracts in Petrobras, where we were and we are meeting with the team here, very satisfied deployment and growing number of users. That's an axis, then growing number of applications. And that's where we want to deploy and go beyond geoscience and our petrotechnical suite, if you like, to digital operation, production and digital operation into the drilling domain, automating the full rig Well Construction process.And again, in Brazil, we are very pleased to meet with Equinor and look after the Peregrino platform, where we're about to deploy for the first time in the world a full automated top side to bottom assembly, full automated autonomous digital journey that we'll realize this year. So we have both the geoscience application deployment, the digital operation. And we have new customers coming in. And you have seen some new contracts that we announced this quarter.So we are growing to the pace we are expecting to be on our trajectory to double. And indeed, this quarter, this was unfortunately masked fully by the APS setback. But we expect this to resume and to be actually one of the leading growth sequential that you would see in the second quarter.OperatorNext, we go to the line of Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America.Chase MulvehillSo a quick question. I guess, coming back to international and just kind of focusing there, we get questions on this international ramp. And because the last 6 months, we've seen some oil price volatility. We've seen a couple of OPEC+ cuts. And so we kind of get a lot of investor questions if there's been any signs of OPEC slowing down, any kind of planned projects or CapEx plans. So let me just ask you if you've seen any indications of OPEC+ members slowing things down at all in the Middle East.Olivier Le PeuchNo, we have not seen it. We have not seen any impact of businesses. And we don't believe there will be any. We believe that these companies and the national companies are really set and fully focused on mobilizing resource to execute their very ambitious capacity expansion plan. I think you are aware of all the commitments. And it's not only UAE and Saudi. This is across many countries in GCC. And I think this is to grow both oil capacity and also gas and commercial gas across the region.So I think I had -- I've been recently in the Middle East, and I have not seen any sign of (inaudible) and challenging. And again, the multiplicity of contract awards that were tendered in the last 18 months and most of them multiyear, if not beyond 5 years, are really indicative of the commitment and the capacity expansion plan that have started. Inflection has happened, and you will see this growing for the rest of the year. So we don't foresee any impact.Chase MulvehillOkay, awesome, appreciate the color there. The follow-up is really kind of on CCUS. You had a lot of announcements in your press release, which really highlighted your experience on the sequestration side. But there are other parts obviously of the value chain. And are there other parts that you would actually think that would be a good fit for SLB, like possibly the capture technology side?Olivier Le PeuchNo, absolutely, I think we have indeed a unique right of play into the sequestration that have translated into significant number of studies and services and modeling in digital that we have provided to a lot of customers. And these customers have approached us to participate, some of them emitters that are non-oil and gas as you have seen some of the examples we gave in the press release earlier today.And then we are using our technology and innovation capability to explore and to invest into capture technology or to partner as we are partnering with Linde into the application of CCS project across the domain of blue hydrogen and ammonia for decarbonizing the natural gas, ammonia and hydrogen production. So we are indeed either associating or investing into capture technology, hence broadening our scope beyond sequestration and using our right of play to expand and create a business that will stand on its own in the years to come.OperatorNext, we go to the line of Arun Jayaram with JPMorgan.Arun JayaramOlivier, I wanted to get some insights on what you're seeing within the subsea segment of Production System. I think you highlighted broadly within Production Systems, $10 billion to $12 billion of backlog growth potential this year or bookings potential. I was wondering if you could maybe characterize SLB's technology offering and integration capabilities relative to your peers as well as provide any update on the strategic transaction that you announced last summer.Olivier Le PeuchYes. Let me take it at the level of Production System first and let me give a quick zoom. So the booking we are talking about is at the Production System level, which is the division encompassing Production System equipment capability from subsea, as you pointed out, from -- actually in well completion, in well actually, subsea surface system processing capabilities. So when you put all of this together, you get an end-to-end from pore-to-process, from sandface-to-processing that is quite unique in integration and delivery capability. Hence, the opportunity we have to participate at scale and be a provider with our partner, Subsea 7, into the project of TPAO that you heard about, where the first gas to flare was realized yesterday and celebrated by the -- in country.And this is quite unique. So that's differentiated. We have end-to-end integration capability. We can design and deploy and develop a gas facility. And we have done it in the past. And we can link it, too, with our partners to our subsea development and participate to the completion architecture. So this end-to-end is quite unique and give us opportunity to participate at a large scale into development.Now very specific to subsea, I think we are also quite differentiated into the way that we can connect to the subsurface. And we have this integration capability from the subsea to the completion architecture. And one thing in particular I would like to highlight or two things, first is the electrical capability of transforming this subsea tree, this subsea control and this subsea well completion control into electric -- full electric capability. This is a game-changer for the deepwater industry, game-changer for low carbon and control -- digital control of subsea equipment and control of zone equipment and completion. This is very much again the case in Brazil. We are very fortunate to have established here a unique center of excellence. And we have, under the sponsorship of ANP, working with multiple operators that have joined us into a joint development program, where we are deploying and we will soon deploy everything from subsea tree to safety valve to flow control valve fully electric that will change the game and creating a new step. So that's differentiated. The other differentiated obviously is our processing, boosting and processing capability. You remember the award that we got last year into Shell for gas processing subsea equipment into a large installation in -- and you have seen two awards this quarter in Brazil, highlighting our boosting capabilities. So we are unique into that position. And again, ability we have to integrate processing equipment subsea with the rest of equipment, well or surface, is unique.And that's something that is adding to our digital capability as well. So when it comes to the announced JV, I think we are seeing the process of going to the regulatory bodies in different parts of the world, so I cannot comment any further than what we commented earlier. This is an exciting outlook, exciting opportunity. But until close, we'll move forward.Arun JayaramGreat. Olivier, my follow-up, you and the Board are in Rio this week. I was wondering if you could characterize on what you're seeing on the ground in terms of the upstream spending picture. And obviously, we've had a regime change recently with the new administration. Are you seeing any potential changes to the fiscal or regulatory regime that could impact spending over the next couple 2, 3 years?Olivier Le PeuchIf anything, this visit has been outstanding, outstanding for the Board, outstanding for engagement we have to customers and clearly highlighting the potential of Brazil to be fulfilling a significant supply growth. In the future, as I said, ANP and Brazil has ambition to reach or exceed 4 billion barrel from 3.3 billion today, I mean, on barrel per day. And they have already laid out the foundation of this of both production enhancement into the mature basin, the Campos Basin or the land basins and accelerating -- continue to accelerate the development of the subsalt deepwater with up to 20 FPSO already into the play.So I think they also are pushing forward to the next frontier. They are about to explore Equinor margin. That give us another leg, if you like, of Brazil growth in the future beyond the already committed multiyear FPSO contract that are in place. So we don't see any change. If anything, we see an acceleration and extension of the duration of this Brazil outlook.And if I had to highlight one noticeable change that I've seen, a commitment to decarbonize, a commitment to digitalize that I think is the new -- the leadership is recommitted to. And we have seen it. And you will see it in the future. Digital operation will accelerate in Brazil by the main operator here. And the country will accelerate this commitment to CCS. We are very fortunate to be on the first and only bioenergy CCS project in Latin America with FS Bioenergia. And we met the team 2 days ago. And they are very pleased with the progress we are making on the CCS product in Brazil. So you will see more activity and no slowdown. But any upside -- only upside to the offshore environment and then a low-carbon and digital transition accelerating as well.OperatorNext, we go to Neil Mehta with Goldman Sachs.Neil Singhvi MehtaFirst question was around cash flow, and working capital specifically was a bigger outflow than we had modeled in the quarter. Does that all reverse over the course of the year and you could talk about some of the moving pieces around that?Stephane BiguetSure, Neil. So yes, it does reverse. As you know, Q1 is always the lowest quarter of the year for free cash flow. As mentioned, we have the typical working cap buildup. Particularly, we have the payout of annual employee incentives. This is a one-off. It was about $500 million in the first quarter. And then we build inventory for anticipated growth, particularly in the Production System division, as we've mentioned.So even though it was -- it remained negative, the free cash flow actually came slightly ahead of our own expectations. Our DSO was the lowest historically for a first quarter, so we were quite happy with that. So yes, it will increase in the second quarter. And it will accelerate in the second half on higher EBITDA, continuous capital discipline and working capital unwinding. Keeping in mind, we typically generate the majority of our annual cash flow in H2. But it will increase materially in Q2.So when you put it all together, the 2023 full year free cash flow will be significantly higher than last year and clearly, on the trajectory to deliver the 10% free cash flow margin we committed for the 2021 to 2025 period. And just to close, this will allow us to, as Olivier mentioned and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, to return $2 billion of -- to shareholders in the form of dividend and buybacks together.Neil Singhvi MehtaThat's really helpful. The follow-up is just the margins at digital. I think it's hard to isolate because of some of the volatility around APS. Can you give us a sense of how you're seeing the underlying margin trends at the core digital business? And in Q2, that segment margin progression, I would imagine, strengthens as you work through some of these Ecuador challenges.Olivier Le PeuchYes. So as a reminder for everyone, I think our Digital &amp; Integration division, I think, comprise and combines digital and exploration data with our Asset Performance Solutions. So at the onset of our digital journey, we have set clear ambition for digital margin to be highly accretive to SLB, at the same time, to accelerate our growth to double our revenue from '21 to '25. We are on that journey and clearly delivering a very accretive margin to SLB.So now we have demonstrated in the last few quarters last year that we -- when we leverage best performance in APS and our differentiated digital offering, we deliver D&amp;I margin visibly in excess of 30%. Now notwithstanding similar setback as we had natural setback in APS, ambition for D&amp;I as a combination is to continue to deliver highly accretive margins, certainly in the 30s. So going forward, we expect the margins of D&amp;I to sequentially improve based on the very solid revenue growth from digital and very accretive margin for digital, combined with a return of growth for APS and returning a decent margin for APS. So as a whole, we're expecting to not only revenue increase but margin expand sequentially and to continue to be accretive -- highly accretive for the rest of the year.OperatorNext, we go to the line of Scott Gruber with Citigroup.Scott Andrew GruberOlivier, you mentioned the resurgence in exploration, which is great to hear for SLB. One concern out there though is the potentially limited number of experienced geologists across the customer base to prosecute the exploration programs just because G&amp;G departments were definitely scaled down during the pandemic. Is this a legitimate constraint on the strength of the exploration cycle? Or is this capability being rebuilt across the industry? What are you seeing on that front?Olivier Le PeuchNo, I will not be overly concerned by this. I think there are two factors that are playing into this. The first at digital, I think, is having a significant productivity gain for processing, analyzing and generating prospects, as we call it, from modeling -- from structural modeling to prospect identification. The seismic dataset as well as the capability to process using digital capability has significantly improved. So the ability to create spotlight on the gas find or the oil pools, I think, is better than it's ever been and certainly much better than the last cycle.And secondly, I think there is a significant service consulting capability that we participate into that can help complement and provide support to our customers. But I would say digital, productivity, technology, that has improved and give higher accuracy, better geology interpretation capability, better structural modeling from seismic to well line and to modeling or to sampling like (inaudible) technology, all combine to give a significant support to the G&amp;G team of our customers and to not slow down but actually accelerate and improve the productivity and ability to generate prospects. So I'm not concerned. And I believe that you will see this prospect to be fast-tracked from exploration to appraisal to development going forward.Scott Andrew GruberNo, that's great. And just how would you compare the strength of this exploration cycle to those of the past? Is the trajectory trending us back towards that 2011 to 2014 period? Could we possibly get back to the mid- to late 2000s levels just as tieback opportunities are consumed? Just some color on the potential strength of this exploration cycle relative to history would be great.Olivier Le PeuchSo I think I will contrast it more by saying the type of activity in exploration that is happening. And I think there are a lot of near-field exploration as it is called or backyard exploration that is being used by most operators that have gained access to critical asset, critical basin or advantaged assets. And they want to explore and do near-field exploration across and beyond and use tieback. So there is a lot of exploration happening across every basin, major basin, that characterize this and has been -- this trend has been going up. And this trend is certainly different from the greenfield, frontier exploration that characterized maybe the last cycle. However, this cycle, I think, beyond the near-field exploration, we are seeing a return of frontier exploration, driven by energy security, driven by the desire to replace reserves and to secure new gas particularly. And we see it happening across many basins. I mentioned before, the (inaudible) margin as one. You heard about obviously continuous exploration, which is almost becoming a near-field exploration across Guyana. But if you go across the Atlantic, you will find a lot of exploration happening in the south part of Africa, particularly some huge success for two or three operators into Namibia that are here on the onset of something that could be very significant for the industry in oil development.And then gas in East Med, I think, has been developing. And you heard about the development that we helped fast-track on the Black Sea. That was also gas. So security is incentivizing people to invest and operators to invest into certain regions with access to the demand market. And near-field is continuing to grow very well. So in combination, it's different from the past, and I will not try to compare the scale. But I think the quality of this exploration and the diversity in terms of customers and in terms of basin is quite unique and is really accelerating this year.OperatorNext, we go to the line of Roger Read with Wells Fargo.Roger David ReadMaybe just to come back to the exploration appraisal kind of question. You mentioned that earlier, slowdown in North America offset or more than offset by what's going on in E&amp;A. So I was just curious, what -- and I think you also mentioned it had materially improved in the last couple of months. What you think really has led to this increase in E&amp;A? Because it's not as if commodity prices weren't good in '22, right? And there haven't been something exceptional thus far in '23. So is it a change in just how your customers are looking at their future inventories? Or is there something else that's helping to drive this improvement?Olivier Le PeuchI think the energy security, the supporting commodity price outlook and the desire, indeed, to go and leverage the cycle, to explore and to tie back reserve to the existing advantaged basin or to fast-track gas or new oil pools as I described earlier. Now the timing of it, the acceleration, I think, is linked more to the availability of -- and the contracting of deepwater rigs or the contracting of rigs offshore or land on some occasion, when it is -- when this exploration is happening more than (inaudible). But the cycle has started last year of E&amp;A return, is accelerating in line to some extent with the offshore acceleration. And I think it will be part of the mix and will give an opportunity to extend and create a new leg of activity and a new leg of FID in 2 or 3 years from now, when those exploration will have been appraised and will be FID at that time. So I think it's more -- it's an underlying trend that have started in the last few quarters and have accelerated. And I think that is a more long view that customers are taking and not looking at the short-term uncertainty or short-term commodity price variation and committing on one new basin or committing on expanding near-field exploration. So that's the way we have seen it.Roger David ReadOkay. So maybe just the natural evolution within a cycle, I mean, as things get some duration, you would expect the exploration to pick up. One other question for you, just APS, so obviously, kind of highlighted had some issues. Looking back over the last couple of years, there's been talk of potentially disposing of these assets or at least not investing in them aggressively. I was just curious, it seems like M&amp;A has picked up or at least talk of it within the E&amp;P sector. So more likely, less likely, same to look for a way to exit these assets as you go forward?Stephane BiguetSo look, Roger, on APS, we really have to distinguish Ecuador. These are service contracts, tariff-based. There's no intention to exit. And we do need to maintain a minimum level of investment. But rest assured, these projects are highly positive in terms of not only earnings but cash flow.The Canada asset is a bit different. This is a pure equity position. And it's also very accretive in terms of cash flow even at current commodity prices. And as you know, we ran a process on that particular asset last year. We were not satisfied with the offers we received. So at the moment, we are happy with keeping that asset and the cash flow it generates. But if one day, there is an offer at the right price, we'll certainly consider it.Olivier Le PeuchSo ladies and gentlemen, I think I want to give a close to this call, it's almost to the hour. So to conclude today's call, I would like to leave you with the following takeaways. First, the quality of the unfolding upcycle in oil and gas is improving with unique attributes of resilience, breadth and duration. This is very much evidenced by the strengthening outlook in both Middle East and offshore markets and further reinforced by the tight supply balance as demand forecast approach new highs at year-end.Second, our strong start of the year gives us further confidence in our full year financial ambition. Directionally, the dynamics in international markets will likely offset the moderation of activity growth in North America. In fact, we are witnessing a gradual shift from short- to long-cycle investment and a further transition to international with both effects closely aligned with our strengths and paving the way for an exciting outlook for years to come.Third, our overall performance demonstrates the strength of our portfolio, focused on the most attractive and resilient market segments globally, both in oil and gas and low-carbon solutions. Our divisions continue to align with customer's utmost priorities on value delivered through performance and integration with digital transformation and decarbonization as industry mandates. Additionally, pricing continues to trend positively, enabling us to extract more value for our products and services.As a result, we reaffirm our ambition to further expand margins as the cycle unfolds, to grow earnings to new levels in this cycle and to significantly increase returns to shareholders as further demonstrated this quarter. I remain very confident in the alignment of our strategy with the fundamental trends in the energy market and fully trust the SLB team to continue outperforming in this context.Now before I close, I wanted to announce that ND Maduemezia will be moving to a new career opportunity in SLB after a remarkable stance in his position as Investor Relations VP for the past 3 years. Thank you, ND, for the support and positive engagement with our investors and market analysts. Replacing ND is James McDonald, who is transitioning from his previous role as Americas Land Basin President. Welcome, James. With this, I wanted to close today's call and wish you all the best. Thank you. Good day, everyone.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

Apparently it formerly has changed his name now to SLB, which is the same as its ticker. The shares aren't moving much this morning, even though the company beat on the top and bottom line. It did report weaker than expected cash flow and also noted its North American onshore market could see activity plateau this year, which is interesting. This was its best first quarter profit in eight years as it saw an increase in its fee revenue, which is interesting.BRAD SMITH: Yeah, the CEO, Olivier Le Peuch, I believe I pronounce that correctly, sorry if I did not. But the quarter was defined by strong activity dynamics offshore. And then in the broader international basins, most notably in well construction and production systems.So those are some of the catalysts for the quarter. There you're taking a look at the cash flow from operations coming in at $330 million. And then additionally here the net income attributable to SLB of $934 million, that increased 83% year over year. So some really strong catalysts driving that increase in net income in this most recent quarter as well.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. And this is something that we've seen for a lot of these different oilfield services companies, right, that we have seen strength there. It is interesting that commentary about how we might see activity plateau there. And then I think that's something that perhaps investors are going to be paying more attention to. The stock's actually a little bit lower this year after we saw a big increase in a lot of the energy stocks last year. Energy this year has been an under-performer.And it looks like in this particular report that analyst coverage and analyst commentary, I should say, is focused on that cash flow number and saying that number was disappointing. Cowan saying free cash flow was, quote, ""weak and below consensus"" but that's not unusual for the first quarter. So that's something that people are looking at. And it looks like that the longer-term outlook seems to be relatively positive, that comment about the plateauing notwithstanding.Story continuesBRAD SMITH: So this is the last time we get to say Schlumberger is what you're telling me.JULIE HYMAN: No, we can--BRAD SMITH: We can still say it?

This compares to earnings of $0.34 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 3.28%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this world's largest oilfield services company would post earnings of $0.69 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.71, delivering a surprise of 2.90%.Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.Schlumberger , which belongs to the Zacks Oil and Gas - Field Services industry, posted revenues of $7.74 billion for the quarter ended March 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.18%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $5.96 billion.

Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.Empirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions.

The company’s revenues are expected to have improved from the year-ago reported figure while the earnings are expected to have declined.In the last reported quarter, NTRS’ earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Results were adversely impacted by a rising expense base, worsening credit quality, lower fee income and weak capital ratios. Yet, a rise in net interest income (NII), driven by higher rates, acted as a tailwind.Northern Trust has a disappointing earnings surprise history. Its earnings surpassed estimates in one of the trailing four quarters, and missed thrice, the negative surprise being 1.36%, on average.Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Northern Trust Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNorthern Trust Corporation price-eps-surprise | Northern Trust Corporation Quote NTRS’ activities in the to-be-reported quarter were inadequate to raise analysts’ optimism. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings of $1.51 per share has moved 2% downward in the past month. Moreover, the figure indicates a 14.69% decrease from the year-ago quarter’s reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $1.76 billion, suggesting growth of 2.28% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Here are other factors that are expected to have impacted NTRS’ quarterly performance:NII: The lending environment weakened during the quarter under review, with the pace of loan growth across most categories slowing down as the quarter progressed. Per the Fed’s latest data, commercial real estate loans, consumer loans, and commercial and industrial loan growth declined in the quarter under review. This was due to an uncertain economic environment owing to the collapse of the Silicon Valley Bank and heightening recession fears.Hence, a lower level of loans is likely to have affected average interest-earning assets. Also, outflows are expected as depositors seek safer too-big-to-fail banks.The Zacks Consensus Estimate of $131.9 billion for average interest-earning assets for the quarter indicates a 1.4% decline from the last reported figure.Federal Reserve hiked rates by 50 basis points in the to-be-reported quarter and 25 bps in the prior quarter. The policy rate reached 4.75-5%, the highest since 2008. Such successive rate hikes have limited any further positive impact on the company’s NII.Weakening lending scenario and lower-to-no-positive impact of higher rates is anticipated to have affected NII during the quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NII is expected to have fallen 1.3% to $528 million sequentially.Fee Income: Northern Trust uses a lag effect to calculate its custody and fund administration as well as investment management fees, i.e., computations are based on the prior-quarter end valuations.The performance of equity markets was moderate in the fourth quarter. Hence, the muted market performance in the fourth quarter is likely to have hindered equity trading volumes and led to lower client activities. This is likely to have resulted in lower custody and fund administration, and investment management fees for NTRS in the first quarter.Also, NTRS provides the majority of its asset-management services through its Asset Servicing unit, which generates a significant portion of total revenues. Due to a decline in the U.S. stock prices and global fixed income, asset servicing and asset management fees are likely to have faced headwinds.The wealth management unit is likely to have been affected by a decline in equity market indices &amp; fixed income values. This is anticipated to have affected fee income of the first quarter.Nonetheless, the elimination of fee waiver and the ongoing creation of new businesses are positives for the fee income.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for security commissions and trading income, pegged at $36.1 million, reflects a 2.8% rise sequentially.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for total fee income is pegged at $1.23 billion, indicating a 25.3% rise from the prior quarter’s reported figure.Expenses: NTRS’ investments in digital initiatives and technology are likely to have kept costs elevated in the quarter. These investments might aid the company over the long term, but the rising current expense level is anticipated to have curbed the bottom-line expansion in the first quarter. Costs are likely to have increased due to inflation and increased hiring.Story continuesWhat Does the Zacks Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Northern Trust this time around.

HOLX is slated to report second-quarter fiscal 2023 results on May 1, after the closing bell.In the last reported quarter, the company’s earnings of $1.07 per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 18.9%. Its earnings surpassed the consensus estimate in each of the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 30.60%.Let’s see how things have shaped up prior to the announcement.Factors at PlayDiagnosticsIn second-quarter fiscal 2023, Hologic is expected to have witnessed strong growth in the Diagnostics business (excluding COVID) from the growing adoption of Panther instruments and an expanded Panther installed base. During the first-quarter earnings update, Hologic noted that the company has nearly 3,250 Panthers instruments placed globally. In the to-be-reported quarter, its performance might have been driven by broad-based growth and fueled by a combination of legacy and newer assays in the portfolio.During the fiscal first quarter, BV/CV/TV had registered strong growth compared with the prior year as the company grows in the IVD vaginitis market. We believe this trend to have continued in the fiscal second quarter as well.However, with COVID testing significantly down over the past few months, Hologic’s Molecular Diagnostics business is likely to have been impacted by lower COVID-related sales.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the total Diagnostics’ second-quarter revenues is pegged at $485 million, suggesting a decline of 50.9% from year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Breast HealthIn recent months, the ongoing semiconductor chip shortage has aggravated due to persistent supply-chain issues and the current geopolitical environment.

96,9b4dc0ba-72f8-343f-811f-59c468134ae6,NFLX,2023-04-22,Hollywood writers strike: Here's what it could mean for your favorite shows,Yahoo Finance Video,https://finance.yahoo.com/video/hollywood-writers-strike-heres-could-120032178.html,1682164832,VIDEO,"['WBD', 'NFLX', 'DIS']","[Hollywood is on the brink of its first writers strike in 15 years, but this time it's not a rerun of 2007. The Writers Guild of America (WGA) has voted to authorize a strike if a deal with major studios is not reached by May 1st. If a strike does occur, it will cause a full production shutdown, affecting actors, stage crew, studio teams, and the biggest companies in Hollywood, as scripted series across both network TV and streaming grind to a halt.Many in Hollywood have weighed in on the potential strike, with Netflix (NFLX) executives directly addressing it during the company's Q1 2023 earnings call. Netflix said it has a long and robust slate of content just in case there is a strike, but executives reiterated they're at the table and want to find a solution.Yahoo Finance’s Allie Canal breaks down the latest for investors.Video TranscriptALEXANDRA CANAL: Hollywood is facing its first potential writer's strike in 15 years. But it's not a rerun of 2007. Here's what you need to know. The Writers Guild of America, AKA, the WGA, represents thousands of television and movie writers. April 17, the union voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike if a deal with major studios was not reached by May 1, the day the Guild's three-year contract expires.A strike would cause a full production shutdown, affecting actors, stagehands, studio crew, and the biggest companies in Hollywood as scripted series across both network television and streaming grind to a halt. The WGA have been negotiating with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios.The talks have centered on pay concerns brought on by the streaming boom in addition to other fundamental changes within entertainment like the recent wave of cost-cutting measures, which have included layoffs and scrapped projects. What's different today versus prior years is that many of these studios are not pure play production houses anymore, meaning they have their own streaming divisions as well as their own profitability concerns.Story continuesAnd as we know, streaming shows often have less episodes and less residual income compared to traditional network TV, which means less money in the pockets of these writers. Many in Hollywood have weighed in on the potential strike with Netflix executives directly addressing it during the company's Q1 earnings call.TED SARANDOS: We don't want a strike. The last time there was a strike, it was devastating to creators. It was really hard on the industry. It was painful for local economies that support production. And it was very, very, very bad for fans.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Netflix said it has a long and robust slate of content in the event of a strike. But executives reiterated that they're at the table and they want to find a solution. It's similar to what we heard from Warner Brothers Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who told reporters he was optimistic a deal could be reached in a way that's fair to all parties.But they're assuming the worst from a business perspective, and also have backup content produced and ready to go if needed. While some analysts have suggested a strike could be good for cash flow since no new content means no new expenses, the general consensus is that a strike would not be good for the industry.JASON BAZINET: At the end of the day, the street doesn't like the uncertainty that comes with a strike. It's going to just inject more noise as the cadence of new content slows down.ALEXANDRA CANAL: With so much at stake for both parties, the pressure is on to reach a deal. Or else, the industry faces yet another major blow just three years after the pandemic.[MUSIC PLAYING]]"

This week, we expect a pickup in U.S. first-quarter earnings results. Some major banks have already reported, beating market expectations for profits. However, according to FactSet data, first-quarter earnings are expected to experience the largest decline in three years, marking the second consecutive quarter of such declines. Amid this doom and gloom situation, analysts are upgrading stocks such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), among many others.The market experienced a quiet evening and morning with little news to report on April 20. Stocks in the US and Europe remained steady, while Europe's composite reading saw a jump thanks to service strength, despite softness in manufacturing. Japan's core CPI exceeded the St consensus, but the BOJ isn't expected to take any policy actions at the next meeting. Chinese stocks fell, with the media citing ""Biden's investment curbs,"" but the curbs have been anticipated for some time. Bloomberg reports that the PBOC will scale back pandemic-era stimulus measures, but China's domestic macro story remains strong. While there were no significant developments in earnings reports since the US close, several large industrial firms have expressed optimism about the global growth outlook.Chuck Grom, an analyst at Gordon Haskett, upgraded Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) rating from Accumulate to Buy. At the same time, UBS analyst John Hodulik upgraded Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) from Neutral to Buy. Meanwhile, notable stocks, including Coterra Energy Inc.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Stocks that will 10x in 5 Years According to the Media. Investing in the stock market can very well be described as reading a crystal ball. After all, profit or gains are the primary motives anyone ever buys shares, and the crystal ball consists of a variety of factors including the firm's positioning in its market, the market size, a potential early mover advantage, growths for the market, financial fundamentals, and management strength among some of the few factors that most folks analyze before making an investing decision.For the uninitiated, these factors can feel overwhelming at times. However, get them right then all you have to do is to sit back and enjoy the returns. And in some cases the returns are massive. Stocks that return more than 100% are called multi baggers, and you might be surprised to know that there are dozens of them on the market. Our coverage, 12 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Now, list down exactly a dozen of these companies. Out of the top twelve, the top three stocks that gained more than 300% in returns at the time of publishing are  Nine Energy Service, Inc. (NYSE:NINE),  Target Hospitality Corp. (NASDAQ:TH), and Scorpio Tankers Inc. (NYSE:STNG), which gained 642%, 372%, an 334% during the twelve month period that ended on December 13, 2022. Where are these companies now? Well, Nine Energy, a popular Wall Street Bets stock, lost most of its gains this year, Target Hospitality is down 14% year to date, but Scorpio Tankers has gained an additional 5% over the course of 2023's first four months. On the surface, this might make you scratch your head and think that perhaps multi bagger stocks are nothing but huff and puff. But look a little deeper and you'll realize that had you timed your bets at the right time and then cashed out right at the top, you'd have made massive returns before the shares dropped.Story continuesAnother cool set of stocks that excites investors is ten bagger stocks. Think a stock returning more than 100% is stunning? Well, there's an entire category of stocks called ten baggers, which refers to shares that appreciate one thousand percent! Sounds a bit like a fairy tale, doesn't it? After all, if there was a surefire way of turning your dollar into $1,000 then everybody would be rushing to these companies too. However, once again, we've got a surprise for you as there are several ten bagger stocks out there as well. But these gains have a long time period, as typically if a firm's shares have gained 1,000% in just a year then you have more reasons to be suspicious than to be excited.So, the next question to ask is what are these ten baggers, and which firms have seen these returns on the stock market? Well, the first stock is everyone's favorite, the Cupertino, California consumer technology giant Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Since 2013, Apple's shares have jumped by more than 10.5x, from an approximate trading value of $14 in late April to today's $161 per share. Another firm whose shares have grown by more than 10x is Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). Netflix's shares were trading at approximately $23 in April 2023, with the current share price of $334 making the gains clear as daylight. Others that have bested the market and posted even stronger returns are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).After identifying a handful of ten baggers, one has to wonder what are the secrets to their success. Well, for that you'd have to jump right to the top of our list and see some of the factors we believe make for strong stock picking. Out of these, Apple, Netflix, NVIDIA, and AMD were all favorably positioned in their markets. AMD is among the handful of firms that has a license to make and sell x86 microprocessors, which are the backbone of modern day computing. NVIDIA is among the earliest movers in accelerated computing and artificial intelligence. Netflix developed an online streaming platform before all others, and Apple was the first to introduce user friendly yet technologically complex gadgets.NVIDIA's founder and chief executive officer Mr. Jen-Hsun Huang revealed the secrets of his success in an interview given to CNBC in March 2023, where he highlighted some crucial bets that the company made before all others and outlined:But the part that was really wonderful was when we realized that Alexnet is not just some neural network, but it's a whole new way of doing software. Alexnet is profound in that way. Not only was it a giant breakthrough in computer vision, it was also a profoundly new way of doing software. Some people call it software 2.0, where the machine augments the software programmers, and the data writes the software. Instead of humans typing in a software program, the data creates the software.That way of using experience or data to cause a software to be able to make future predictions was so profound, and we had the good wisdom to put the whole company behind it. We saw early on, about a decade or so ago, that this way of doing software could change everything. All of the software that we wanted to write that we didn't know how to write, we could now do. And that was a great decision, and we changed the company from the bottom to all the way to the top and sideways. Every chip that we made was focused on artificial intelligence. We built a wonderful research organization dedicated to artificial intelligence. Our entire software stack was invented for AI.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some stocks that can grow by 10x in the next five years, with some top picks being SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Desktop Metal, Inc. (NYSE:DM).15 Stocks that will 10x in 5 Years According to the MediaPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology We cast a wide net for our hunt for stocks that can grow 10x in five and ten years. As part of our research, we consulted 11 different financial media outlets (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11).

Then, initial preference was given to stocks that appear on multiple lists and on lists that indicate growth in five years. After this, those that do not appear on more than one list were ranked through share price upside. In our final compilation, the latter group is listed first as part of fifteen stocks that can grow 10x in five years, and Meta Platforms, Inc.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Dalio’s investment philosophy and portfolio construction, go directly to the Top 5 Technology Stocks to Buy in 2023, According to Ray Dalio.Billionaire Ray Dalio argued in a recent interview on the Julia La Roche Show that global central banks are less willing to hold the US dollar for two reasons. First, the greenback has serious competition for the first time in many decades from the Chinese yuan. He noted that China's share of global trade is ascendant while the US share is shrinking. Most importantly, China is promoting trading agreements centered on its currency rather than the dollar, which has been the norm for a long time. Secondly, Western sanctions against Russia and several other countries have exposed new risks for holding dollar-denominated assets. For instance, the US and its allies froze Russia's assets, with the US Fed freezing currency reserves. To Dalio, the action was not only high-handed but spooky to global central banks that hold dollar-denominated currency reserves.Last year, Dalio said during CNBC's Squawk Box interview that investors are better off not keeping cash because inflation had reached dangerous levels. Instead, he argued that putting the money in a well-balanced portfolio was safe. He also spent time discussing his latest book, ""The Changing World Order,"" in which he shares valuable insights on the current geopolitical and economic cycles.Dalio has made bullish comments on China's tech sector, arguing that it is vibrant and poised to challenge the United States. At home, Dalio was among the loudest speakers regarding the possibility of a tech stock bubble pre-2021. He said in an interview in early 2022 that the Fed's rate hikes would hit hard the 'bubble-type' tech stocks. His thoughts were prescient because several tech stocks lost significant value in 2022 after the Fed's sustained campaign of rate hikes.Story continuesTop 10 Technology Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Ray DalioRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur MethodologyWe picked top 10 tech stocks from Bridgewater Associates' 13F portfolio as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. Although the billionaire retired from Bridgewater, he remains a mentor, board member and investor at the firm.Top Technology Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Ray Dalio10. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $24.89 million Percentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 0.13% Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 117Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) provides streaming entertainment services, including TV series, movies, documentaries, and mobile games in multiple languages and genres, available on various internet-connected devices. The company has around 231 million paid subscribers across 190 countries.On April 18, Credit Suisse analyst Douglas Mitchelson raised his price objective on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) to $331 from $291 and retained a ‘Neutral’ rating before Q1 earnings report. Credit Suisse predicted positive investor feedback on Netflix's Q1 earnings with increased revenue and margin improvement but anticipated management's caution on Q2 subscriber numbers due to potential password-sharing launches and seasonal effects.Bridgewater Associates owns 84,422 shares in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), valued at more than $24.89 million, which accounts for 0.13% of the hedge fund's portfolio. The hedge fund has boosted its stake in the firm by an impressive 101% in the fourth quarter of 2022.Out of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 117 hedge funds were long Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) during the fourth quarter with aggregate stakes worth $8.15 billion. This compares to 115 hedge funds holding $6.66 billion in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in the previous quarter.Like Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the tech stocks on the radar of Ray Dalio.In its Q4 2022 investor letter, Broyhill Asset Management stated the following about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX):“Speaking of fresh names, we established a new position in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) during the second half. We began accumulating shares after the company reported two consecutive quarters of subscriber losses, which brought the stock down by about 75% from peak to trough. Our investment in Netflix is a good example of what we categorize as a “temporary dislocation” and a great example of the historical investments we’ve made in the tech sector. Unlike other “value” investors, we don’t arbitrarily put tech in the “too hard” pile. We are comfortable and more than happy to underwrite investments in the industry. We just demand a margin of safety when doing it (something often ignored by other investors in the industry). That margin of safety opened up when consensus quickly concluded that Netflix’s growth was over, on the heels of two quarters of subscriber losses, which happened to follow years of surging lock-down-induced demand. The popular narrative was that by pursuing advertising revenue, Netflix was all but admitting that streaming television was completely saturated. We thought otherwise. With ~ 75MM subscribers in the US, even converting a small portion of those 100MM moochers would move the needle3. And given the superiority of the company’s technology and first-party user data, we think the consensus is completely underestimating the long-term potential of a Netflix advertising model.”9. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $28.67 million Percentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 0.15% Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 43International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) provides integrated solutions and services globally, operating through four business segments: Software, Consulting, Infrastructure, and Financing, offering hybrid cloud platform and software solutions, business transformation and technology consulting services, server and storage solutions, and financing services.Securities filings reveal that Bridgewater Associates boosted its stake in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) by 8% during the fourth quarter of 2022. The fund presently owns 203,464 shares of the company worth over $28.67 million, representing 0.15% of the portfolio.Credit Suisse analyst Shannon Cross lowered International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)'s price target to $162 from $165 and maintained an 'Outperform' rating ahead of the Q1 earnings report on April 19, citing that IBM's regular software revenue and AI assets made it more protected than other companies in the case of a possible economic downturn.As of the fourth quarter of 2022, 43 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database held stakes in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM). The most prominent shareholder in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is Adage Capital Management, with 919,590 shares valued at $129.56 million.In its Q4 2022 investor letter, Diamond Hill Capital stated the following about International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM):“New positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and elf Beauty (ELF). Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”8.

Like most of us, he thinks there’s a zero-sum battle between Netflix, Disney+, and others. Except streamers aren’t mutually exclusive. You can subscribe to as many as you want.  In fact, the average U.S. household already subscribes to an extraordinary 5.2 video streamers, a stunning 400% jump from just a few years ago.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home Fake wars are somewhat of a tradition in Hollywood. Decades ago, the “TV Wars” pitted the first three TV networks against each other. Not only did they all survive, but they also thrived and multiplied into a whopping explosion of over 200 TV channels. Today, with a surge of more than 100 hundred streamer Apps and counting, streamers are following their TV network ancestors’ trajectory.  It’s not a streaming war: It's a streaming tsunami–and the tidal wave is colossal. There is however a brutal battle raging right now on a digital battlefield few know of. It’s the bruising face-off among connected TVs (CTVs) vying to capture your living room. As it’s a fight to command just that one TV in the room, it’s a zero-sum game, with clear winners and losers. Welcome to the real streaming wars.Internet-connected digital TVs have been thrust into Hollywood’s spotlight as platforms that aggregate, monetize, measure, and distribute the streaming tsunami. According to Leichtman Research Group, “87% of U.S. TV households now own a CTV.”The combatants in these invisible wars are Asian original equipment manufacturers (such as Samsung and TCL) and Silicon Valley tech titans (such as Google and Amazon). Their products come in two flavors: A smart TV with an operating system or an add-on device with an operating system. Both are hardware-software combos, but it’s always the software that drives the bulk of revenue–and all the eyeballs.Story continuesThe global CTV market was worth $239 billion in 2022 and is forecast to hit $358 billion by 2027. It already eclipses all global theatrical movie, music streaming, and pay-TV markets combined.In a meaningful milestone in the era of digital media, CTV penetration has surpassed Pay TV for the first time in history and led the Pay TV juggernauts to hemorrhage subscribers and revenue.Pay TV’s 30-year-old business model has also flipped. Instead of Pay TV spending billions in carriage fees to Content Providers (Warner Bros, Disney) to carry their TV Networks, now it’s the content providers paying millions to CTVs to carry their streamer apps. CTV ad spending reached $21 billion in 2022. That’s up 39% from 2021, and on track in a few years to surpass linear TV’s 2022 $68 billion ad spend.Equally game-changing is the ad-supported streamer owned by each CTV. These native streamers drive hundreds of millions in revenue because the CTV controls all the ad inventory and the streamer’s prime placement. In addition to being a top revenue driver, they are the second most viewed ad-supported streamer on each platform after YouTube.  CTVs also compile viewer-level, real-time data for ad measurement, targeting, and content recommendations.Perhaps the most seismic shift is how CTVs have democratized content by leveling the playing field between big and independent media. The CNN app is positioned beside the “Newsy” app, thereby decimating what’s left of big media’s long-prized distribution advantage.This makes the home screen on your TV the most valuable real estate in entertainment today. A great example of how some in Hollywood are awakening to this new force is actor-turned-entrepreneur Ryan Reynolds. He realized the value of this ultimate weapon of mass media and joined MNTN, a CTV ad service, as chief creative officer. In a company ad, he proclaims “Connected TV is the future, and it's already here.” Success though has been 20 years in the making.At the turn of the century, Netflix incubated the first CTV which they spun out into a new company called Roku. Two decades later, the battle lines have been drawn and Roku is clearly the winner. Thus far, Roku is the CTV champion with a monstrous 70 million active accounts and a mammoth 40% market share. Their spectacular scale is equal to all Pay TV subscribers combined. Roku also has its own ad-supported streamer that’s watched by an estimated 80 million people. Jenn Vaux, Roku’s head of content, a highly experienced Hollywood executive, says the company’s unique position enables it “to build an educated framework by focusing on content lanes that resonate with our audience.” It seems to have worked.By focusing on innovation, Google TV has made an exciting debut to become one of the fastest-growing players, seizing a 6% share of premium video minutes in a few short years.Shalini Govil-Pai, the general manager of Google TV, is a highly accomplished Hollywood and tech trailblazer who attributes their growth to a similar focus on audience preferences. “With the growing volume of content, we found that consumers end up spending more time looking for something to watch than time actually watching. We help users easily find and discover movies to watch all in one place,” she told me. Their strategy to solve the problem of chaotic and frustrating content discovery could be the biggest threat to the reigning heavyweight champion.While attention-grabbing headlines of streamers battling it out are terrific fun, the real streaming wars have far more at stake: delivering on the promise to upend legacy media.“We want to conquer TV the same way Apple did mobile,” a CTV executive recently told me. Even Netflix is reportedly looking to acquire its old offspring Roku for a variety of purported reasons. Perhaps Netflix know the real streaming wars are not a clash against other streamers. It’s a world war to capture the real battleground: your living room.Aden Ikram is a veteran of both ‘Streaming Wars’ and a graduate of NYU’s Digital Media program where he built one of the first movie streamers and later made his own makeshift CTV.The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.More must-read commentary published by Fortune:A recession in 2023 is now inevitable.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.""Trendlines Over Headlines""On April 12 Piper Sandler's chief market technician, Craig Johnson, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the current market situation and his market outlook. According to Johnson, the market is going to undergo 3 phases: ""a hop, and drop, and a pop"", and right now we are in a ""hop"" phase. According to Johnson, the S&amp;P 500 has the potential to trade up to anywhere between 4,200 and 4,300 during the ""hop"" phase. As for the ""drop"" phase, Johnson expects the market to decline when the Fed decides to cut interest rates, which he expects will happen in the middle of 2023 or possibly in the third quarter of 2023.Craig Johnson noted that ""great downturn reversals have already occurred"" over the past 24 months on the Dow, the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ, the Russell 2000, and the Dow Jones Transportation Average as well. According to Craig Johnson, we have had ""a series of higher highs and higher lows"" and when we look at the lows that were made in September and October 2022, we observe that at that point in time the market was extremely oversold. Here are some comments from Craig Johnson:""If you come back and you look at history, all the way back to 1929, when you look at the fact that we haven't seen in the first quarter (of 2023) a break back below the December lows of last year (2022). That has historically been a pretty bullish sign for the market. In fact, when you look back in time, the market is typically 83% of the time higher, with about 13.7% annual return, when you don't break back below those December lows in the first quarter of the new year. And that's exactly what we are seeing happen this year.""Story continuesWhile the markets may undergo a correction, according to Craig Johnson, investors should focus on the long term for 2023. Craig Johnson expects the S&amp;P 500 to move up to 4,625 by the end of the year. Here is what Craig Johnson of Piper Sandler said:""If you look at some of the underlying indices, clearly, it is trendlines over headlines at this point in time... All the negativity out there at this point in time, stocks aren't going down. They're starting to trend higher and we really need to pay attention to that fact.""Craig Johnson thinks that the National Bureau of Economic Research will officially declare a recession in the back half of 2023. He noted that once a recession is official, ""history shows that you typically backdate that recession's start date by about 7.6 months"". Out of all the recessions since 1929, it was only in 2002 that the market did not bottom, said Johnson, and he thinks that after the market bottoms the S&amp;P 500 will ""pop"" back to 4,625.Craig Johnson further noted that he sees the Fed starting to cut interest rates in July 2023, or possibly after that, and this will lead to a ""quick drop"" in the markets. Craig Johnson talked about investor positioning right now and said:""We're at levels right now that we have seen only at the lows of the market in 2020, 2011, and 2007. The world is already very negatively positioned, and any drop will get bought from our perspective.""While Craig Johnson's market outlook offers valuable insights into the broader market, investors can also consider the individual stocks recommended by Fast Money traders to identify potential near-term opportunities. Fast Money is a popular TV show on CNBC that offers daily stock picks and market insights from a group of experienced traders.

While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the pharmaceutical sector and its outlook this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2023. The pharmaceutical industry in the US is one of the largest in the world, representing roughly 50% of the global pharmaceutical sales revenue, as of 2020. The industry consists of a wide range of players, including large multinational corporations, mid-sized and small companies, and biotech startups. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry, as some companies dealing in vaccines or treatments for the virus experienced increased demand for their products. The trend of spending on Covid-related drugs continued through 2022. Some of the biggest pharma companies, like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), among others, are estimated to have generated approximately $100 billion in revenues in 2022, according to a report by Reuters.The current inflationary period has brought defensive stocks into the limelight as these stocks do not get affected by economic cycles. Pharmaceutical companies are often considered to be defensive as they deal in products that are considered essential for the maintenance of health and the treatment of illnesses, and demand for these products may remain relatively stable even during a recession. The sector also delivered positive returns to shareholders last year, when the S&amp;P 500 recorded its worst annual performance since 2008. The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index gained 4.91% from December 2021 to December 2022, compared with a 19.4% decline in the S&amp;P 500 during the same period. The index returned 3.71% in the past 12 months.Though pharma stocks delivered solid returns in 2022, the sector had a comparatively slow year pertaining to merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) deals compared with the previous years. One of the main reasons for this slowdown was that drugmakers acquired companies with authorized and tested drugs and products, instead of companies with products in clinical trials. Moreover, the economic headwinds from inflation and higher interest rates also hindered the deals last year. The deal value in the biopharma sector fell 42% in 2022, compared with 2021, as reported by Ernst &amp; Young. It was not the case in the past as large-cap pharma companies closed 178 deals from 2016 to 2020 with a total value of over $452.3 billion. However, analysts are positive about the activity gaining momentum this year. PwC expects the total M&amp;A deals to value between $225 billion and $275 billion across all sectors in 2023.

The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo. At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”6.

Vltava Fund mentioned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years. We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt. This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2023. Suggested articles:10 Best FAANG Stocks To Buy Now10 Best Telecom Dividend Stocks To Buy for 202310 Undervalued Lithium Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Silver Mining Stocks To Buy Now.Global economic conditions, geopolitical events, currency fluctuations, and investment demand have all impacted the silver industry in the past few months. The prices of the rare metal can often be volatile, impacting the profitability and viability of silver mining operations. Over the past few years, declining ore grades, increasing production costs, regulatory compliance, community relations, and environmental concerns have also all weighed on the industry. However, silver mining firms have dealt with these challenges in their stride. The global silver mining industry has been steadily producing silver for various industrial applications, jewelry, and investment purposes. According to data from the Silver Institute, global silver mine production for 2023 is expected to be 1.055 billion oz. The top silver producing countries in the world who will benefit from this include Mexico, Peru, China, Russia, and Australia. Mexico has been the world's largest producer of silver for many years, followed by Peru. These countries account for a significant portion of global silver production.There are numerous mining companies involved in silver mining globally, ranging from large multinational corporations to smaller regional and local operators. Some of the major silver mining companies include Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), and Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL), among others discussed in detail below. Silver has a wide range of industrial applications, including electronics, solar panels, medical instruments, and automotive components, which drive demand for silver. As a result, industrial demand for silver is a significant factor in the global silver mining industry. Silver is also used as a store of value and an investment asset, with demand coming from investors who seek exposure to precious metals. Silver is often used for investment purposes in the form of bars, coins, and exchange-traded products (ETFs), which can impact the demand for silver and subsequently the silver mining industry. Sustainability and responsible mining practices are important considerations for many stakeholders in the industry.Story continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we selected mining stocks that have interests in the silver business based on overall hedge fund sentiment.

The new policy will not apply to companies that have applications pending.The measure is one in a series of new orders announced by the DOE's office of fossil energy and carbon management aimed at keeping the U.S. on track to meet its goal of net zero emissions by 2050 while supplying allies with natural gas.The U.S. has approved over 49 billion cubic feet per day of LNG for non-Free Trade Agreement (FTA) country exports - of which more than half are held by LNG projects that are not operating or under construction and have asked for extensions for when they will commence exports.This new policy ""will allow DOE to better assess whether new non-FTA applications are in the public interest; provide more certainty to the U.S. and global LNG export markets; and ensure that DOE is making decisions utilizing the latest market information and analytical tools available,"" the DOE said in a statement.A DOE official said it would help newer LNG projects that use more modern technology and pollution controls to compete for approval.The agency also announced that it has made a decision on two pending applications. It will approve a first-time request by Port Arthur LNG, LLC and Sempra to extend the start date at the Texas terminal to 2028, and reject a second extension request by Energy Transfer's Lake Charles Exports' project in Lake Charles, Louisiana.In a related move, the DOE also issued a request for information from LNG industry participants on Friday on strategies and technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants throughout the LNG process.The DOE has been working on setting standards for certified natural gas, a form of the fuel that producers market as climate friendly.(Reporting by Valerie Volcovici)]"
114,4f176647-9a0c-3023-9915-7506afd57730,M,2023-04-22,"UPDATE 1-US natgas eases on forecasts for milder weather, less heating demand",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-us-natgas-eases-forecasts-185515812.html,1682103315,STORY,['NG=F'],"[(Adds latest prices) April 21 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures eased about 1% on Friday on forecasts for a little less cold weather and lower heating demand over the next two weeks than previously expected. That small decline came even though the amount of gas flowing to U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants remained on track to hit a record high for a second month in a row in April after Freeport LNG's export plant in Texas exited an eight-month outage in February. Front-month gas futures for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 1.6 cents, or 0.7%, to settle at $2.233 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). For the week, the contract rose about 5% for a second week in a row. Data provider Refinitiv said average gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants rose to 14.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in April, up from a record 13.2 bcfd in March. Those seven big U.S. LNG export plants can turn about 13.8 bcfd of gas into LNG. LNG plants can pull in a little more gas than they can turn into LNG because they use some of the fuel to power equipment used to produce LNG. Some analysts have begun to question whether low gas prices in Europe and Asia could force U.S. LNG exporters to cancel cargoes again this summer after mostly mild weather this winter left massive amounts of gas in storage. In 2020, at least 175 LNG shipments were canceled due to oversupply and weak demand. ""In Europe, storage is tracking near 2020 levels, leading to some concern that prices could follow 2020’s path, with spreads between global and U.S. prices narrowing to close export arbs (arbitrage) and shut LNG exports to prevent a global storage containment issue,"" analysts at Bank of America said in a note. Gas stockpiles in northwestern Europe - Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands - were currently about 56% of capacity, keeping the amount of gas in storage about 63% above its five-year (2018-2022) average for this time of year, according to Refinitiv. That is much healthier than U.S. gas inventories, which also contain excess gas after a mild winter and were at about 21% above their five-year norm. To ensure that Europe has enough gas for the winter heating season, the European Union wants utilities to refill stockpiles during the summer injection season to 90% of capacity by Nov. 1. Analysts at ClearView Energy Partners, a research firm, noted ""a scenario where European storage fills much earlier than last year and Asian demand growth does not materialize could reduce LNG margins further, potentially resulting in the cancellation of (U.S. LNG) cargoes once again."" Currently, however, the ""window for shipping U.S. LNG to Asia and Europe remains open,"" ClearView said. Gas was trading near a 21-month low of $13 per mmBtu at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) in Europe and a 22-month low of $12 at the Japan Korea Marker (JKM) in Asia. SUPPLY AND DEMAND U.S. gas futures lag far behind global prices because the U.S. is the world's top producer with all the fuel it needs for domestic use, while capacity constraints prevent the country from exporting more LNG. Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states rose to 100.2 bcfd so far in April, up from 99.7 bcfd in March. That compares with a monthly record of 100.4 bcfd in January. With temperatures expected to decline in coming days, Refinitiv forecast U.S. gas demand, including exports, would rise from 95.0 bcfd this week to 96.6 bcfd next week before sliding to 93.4 bcfd in two weeks as the weather turns seasonally milder. The forecasts for this week and next were lower than Refinitiv's outlook on Thursday.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Silver Mining Stocks To Buy Now.Global economic conditions, geopolitical events, currency fluctuations, and investment demand have all impacted the silver industry in the past few months. The prices of the rare metal can often be volatile, impacting the profitability and viability of silver mining operations. Over the past few years, declining ore grades, increasing production costs, regulatory compliance, community relations, and environmental concerns have also all weighed on the industry. However, silver mining firms have dealt with these challenges in their stride. The global silver mining industry has been steadily producing silver for various industrial applications, jewelry, and investment purposes. According to data from the Silver Institute, global silver mine production for 2023 is expected to be 1.055 billion oz. The top silver producing countries in the world who will benefit from this include Mexico, Peru, China, Russia, and Australia. Mexico has been the world's largest producer of silver for many years, followed by Peru. These countries account for a significant portion of global silver production.There are numerous mining companies involved in silver mining globally, ranging from large multinational corporations to smaller regional and local operators. Some of the major silver mining companies include Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), and Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL), among others discussed in detail below. Silver has a wide range of industrial applications, including electronics, solar panels, medical instruments, and automotive components, which drive demand for silver. As a result, industrial demand for silver is a significant factor in the global silver mining industry. Silver is also used as a store of value and an investment asset, with demand coming from investors who seek exposure to precious metals. Silver is often used for investment purposes in the form of bars, coins, and exchange-traded products (ETFs), which can impact the demand for silver and subsequently the silver mining industry. Sustainability and responsible mining practices are important considerations for many stakeholders in the industry.Story continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we selected mining stocks that have interests in the silver business based on overall hedge fund sentiment.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 largest coal mining companies in USA.One of the most controversial industries of our time, the U.S. coal industry has been the target of climate change activists for a while now, but regardless, still enjoyed a bumper 2022. Before we discuss 2022, let's discuss some of the trends in the past several years, going back to two decades, which have had a huge impact on what was once one of the biggest industries in the country.After climate change started to be taken seriously by most governments in developed countries, laws and regulations aiming to incentivize renewable energy companies and discourage fossil fuel consumption started to be passed, which is also why the most advanced countries in renewable energy are dominated by developed nations. In 2019, coal production had fallen 40% from the peak achieved in 2008, while in the last century, coal employees have fallen from nearly 900,000 to just 43,000. Because of these regulations, several coal giants, including some corporations which were among the largest coal mining companies in USA, had to file for bankruptcy. In 2015 alone, four listed coal companies filed for bankruptcy, including the fourth-largest such company at the time in Alpha Natural Resources. By 2016 alone, around a quarter of all coal companies had filed for bankruptcy or were in the bankruptcy process as mining downturn hit the industry severely. Between 2011 to 2016, the price of coal had fallen by 50% and the industry overall was heavily in debt to the tune of billions of dollars.12 largest mining companies in USACopyright: vyacheslavsvetlichnyy / 123RF Stock PhotoIn the U.S., coal production is heavily focused in a few states, with Wyoming being the biggest coal producer in the country by a mile, accounting for over 41% of total production, while Wyoming, Pennsylvania and West Virginia combined account for over 60% of the company's total coal production. One of the main reasons behind the decline of coal has been the focus on alternative sources, both renewable and non-renewable. While the biggest growth is easily witnessed by some of the largest renewable energy companies by market cap, even natural gas electricity production increased to 38% of the country's total electricity production in 2022, 1% up from 2021 and will then fall back to 36% in 2023. Meanwhile, coal electricity production fell from 23% in 2021 to 20% in 2022 while the decline will continue in 2023, falling to 19%.Story continuesWhile the last several years have not been very positive for the coal mining industry, 2022 was a bumper year for the industry overall, after oil prices increased significantly and an energy crisis gripped Europe due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia is among the biggest oil and gas exporters in the world, and after its war with Ukraine, sanctions were imposed by Western nations and European nations looked elsewhere for energy supplies, all of which was a boon to the coal industry. According to the International Energy Agency, global coal consumption reached a new high in 2022 even though the increase has been expected to be temporary. Global coal consumption in 2022 exceeded 8 billion tonnes in 2022, which was a boon to some of the largest coal mining companies in USA. Hallador Energy Company (NASDAQ:HNRG) saw 1 year returns of 72.2%, CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE:CEIX) saw a one year share price increase of 31% and Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ:ARLP) saw a return of 30.7% in the same time period, just to give a few examples of how coal companies profited in 2022.As mentioned earlier, this boon is expected to be temporary, and the World Bank has stated that coal prices are expected to decline in the medium term but prices are still much higher than the 2017 - 2021 average. China and India led record global consumption while exports were increased by Colombia and South Africa. Meanwhile, in Australia and South Africa, benchmark coal prices fell by around 50% from peaks earned in September 2022 and April 2022 respectively. Coal future prices have also declined considerably in 2023 as compared to 2022 but if gas prices rise further in 2023, this could create more demand for coal and hence, lead to a price increase there. Further risks to the coal industry include global growth falling below forecasts and China's economic revitalization after its abandonment of the nation's zero-Covid policy fails to materialize. One of the largest coal mining companies in the USA, Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) mentioned in its Q4 2022 earnings call ""So for 2023, we have a solid sales book, as we stated. We are completely sold out both in the PRB and our other U.S. thermal mines. So we have a really strong hand there. And so far, the shipments have been going. The nominations have been there and the demand has been there. Our customers, particularly our PRB customers are still short of their target inventories even though they're burning less coal are still short of their inventory. So the demand is there. The challenge we're having is with rail service in the PRB, which was a challenge we had last year and has continued into the start of this year, still with crew shortages, but also there's been some tough weather in the PRB. We are expecting to see that turn around here in the coming months, both railroads have additional crews coming on in February this month. So we're expecting to see some improvements in the rail performance. And at the moment, that really, Lucas, is nothing that I would say that we're seeing from the customer side. It's more of a transportation issue, which is a carryover from last year.""The top two largest coal mining companies in the USA alone account for over 30% of all production in the country. To calculate our ranking, we have considered their coal production in 2021 based on data from the International Energy Agency, and market cap as at 20th April 2023, with data taken from Yahoo Finance.

120,88c804a5-398d-34d3-8c18-ac2b6c2246bc,GD,2023-04-22,3 Aerospace-Defense Stocks to Watch on Bright Jet Deliveries View,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-aerospace-defense-stocks-watch-142502440.html,1682087102,STORY,"['NOC', 'GD', 'LMT', '^GSPC']","[Impressive projections for aircraft deliveries in 2023, as stated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), bode well for aerospace-defense stocks that are engaged in commercial aerospace-related operations. However, pandemic-induced supply-chain disruption in the U.S. defense electronics space remains a threat to the industry players. Nevertheless, the outlook remains bright for the defense side of the aerospace-defense industry, buoyed by a solid budget proposal, which should keep investors interested in this industry. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are Lockheed Martin LMT, Northrop Grumman NOC and General Dynamics GD.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology (IT) services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of revenues comes from defense contractors, offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services and supply chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in a report published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in February 2023, industry-wide revenue per kilometer increased 55.5% year over year. IATA projects a solid recovery for aircraft deliveries in 2023, with a total of 1,540 aircraft scheduled to be delivered this year, up 24% from 2022. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace manufacturers, which have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of their orders altogether by airlines.Expanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention the U.S. fiscal 2024 defense budget request of $842 billion for the Pentagon, which indicates a 3.2% improvement from fiscal 2023’s enacted amount. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which should enhance their top line.Supply Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption has been observed in the Aerospace and Defense industry, of late, courtesy of pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected smaller suppliers, like aircraft parts makers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace and the aftermarket business. Although the global economy has started to improve, lingering market disequilibria will likely continue to keep prices high, including that of labor, as estimated by IATA. This, in turn, might keep the growth trajectory of the U.S. aerospace and defense industry constricted, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to Industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines’ operations, which are already burdened with high inflation and jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve’s policy rate now stands at 4.75%, having started 2022 at 0.25%, and will likely peak in 2023 to the vicinity of 5%, as reported by IATA. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines, which earn revenues in non-U.S. currency. Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that operate in commercial aerospace, in particular.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #52, which places it in the top 21% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few aerospace-defense stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Aerospace-Defense industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its own sector over the past year.

121,f88afd39-1fff-3c91-b4b6-8e3926039d8c,WYNN,2023-04-22,Buy These Top-Rated Stocks for China's Strong GDP Growth,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-top-rated-stocks-chinas-002212584.html,1682122932,STORY,"['NKE', 'WYNN']","[China’s first quarter GDP numbers were much anticipated after reopening its economy and ending its Zero Covid-19 policy last December. Impressively, China’s GDP grew by 4.5% during the first quarter topping expectations of 4% and rising 2.2% year over year.Furthermore, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank rate China as the world’s largest economy based on purchasing power. As shown in the nearby chart, China’s total GDP in currency is now at $17.73 trillion and just behind the U.S. at $23.32 trillion.The World BankImage Source: The World BankGDP growth is oftentimes indicative of a strong consumer and this makes it more intriguing to invest in Chinese companies at the moment. With that being said, there are quite a few American companies that derive revenue from China and offer an alternative option outside of buying Chinese companies that have American Depository Receipts (ADRs) on U.S. stock exchanges.It is important to note that the market is forward-looking so many stocks offering valuable exposure to China have already soared in recent months but there is still opportunity among the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector in particular.  To that point, China’s retail sales of consumer goods increased 5.8% year over year according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Here are three top-rated Zacks Consumer Discretionary stocks that should have more upside and offer diversification to China’s economy.Trip.com (TCOM)Among ADRs, Trip.com's stock stands out right now and currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with its Leisure and Recreation Services Industry in the top 29% of over 250 Zacks industries.As a one-stop travel service company based in Shanghai, Trip.com is expected to be a beneficiary of the warmer summer months ahead as we approach peak travel season. Travel is expected to be higher in 2023 from lingering pent-up demand following the pandemic. This will certainly be the case for destinations in China after reopening its borders.  Story continuesEarnings estimate revisions have noticeably trended higher for Trip.com over the last 60 days. Over the last two months, fiscal 2023 and FY24 EPS estimates have climbed 12% and 11% respectively.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEven better, Trip.com earnings are now forecasted to skyrocket 275% this year at $1.09 per share compared to EPS of $0.29 in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to soar another 67% to $1.83 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWynn Resorts (WYNN)Outside of investing in Chinese companies directly through ADRs, Wynn Resorts is a prime example of an American company that should benefit from the growth of China’s economy.Wynn stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with the Las Vegas-based company operating its casino resorts in sin city, Everett Massachusetts, and Macau China.In fact, more than 70% of Wynn’s revenue comes from the three casinos it operates in Macau which is considered China’s version of Las Vegas. Indicative of the boost the reopening of the Chinese economy will add to Wynn’s post-pandemic recovery and future growth is that sales are anticipated to climb 45% this year and jump another 17% in FY24 to $6.43 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchChina’s growth is even more crucial to Wynn’s bottom line. To that note, earnings are expected to rebound and climb swing from a loss of -$4.47 per share last year to EPS of $1.05 in 2023. More intriguing, fiscal 2024 earnings are forecasted to leap another 385% at $5.10 a share. Largely attributed to Wynn’s buy rating is that earnings estimate revisions have soared and continue to go up.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNike (NKE)With an iconic global brand, Nike’s stock will get an added boost from China’s reopening and lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Notably, despite Nike’s Greater China segment sales dipping -9% in 2022 at $7.54 billion this still accounted for 16% of its total sales.Even better, this still represented 47% growth over the last five years with 2018 Greater China sales at $5.13 billion. As the Chinese economy kicks back in gear, the footwear and apparel giant will certainly look to continue its expansion in the People’s Republic.                                                       Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis will certainly add to Nike’s steady growth and earnings power. Nike’s earnings are forecasted to drop -13% this year but rebound and pop 23% in FY24 at $4.00 per share. Plus, earnings estimates have continued to tick higher for FY23 and FY24 over the last 30 days.Nike stock is more appealing considering the company has put together a string of nice earnings beats despite lowered contributions and growth from its Greater China segment. Suprisingly, Nike crushed its fiscal third-quarter earnings expectations by 52% in March with EPS at $0.79 compared to estimates of $0.27 a share.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayThese Zacks Consumer Discretionary stocks offer unique diversification to China’s huge economy. Furthermore, China’s strong first-quarter GDP numbers are a positive affirmation that these companies are growing as well. The rising earnings estimate revisions appear to reaffirm this and could continue to trend higher leading to nice upside in Trip.com, Wynn Resorts, and Nike stock.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

On that day, Wynn Resorts is projected to report earnings of -$0.18 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 85.12%. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $1.25 billion, up 31.58% from the year-ago period.WYNN's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $1.05 per share and revenue of $5.47 billion.

MAT is scheduled to report first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 26, after the closing bell. In the last reported quarter, the company earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 33.3%.The Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter bottom line is pegged at a loss of 25 cents per share against adjusted earnings of 8 cents per share reported in the year-ago quarter.For revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $750 million, suggesting a decline of 28% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Factors at PlayMattel’s first-quarter 2023 performance is likely to have been affected by a decline in North America gross billings. This decline is subject to the dismal performance of Infant, Toddler, and Preschool (including Fisher-Price and Thomas &amp; Friends), Dolls (including Barbie), Action Figures, Building Sets, Games and Other. Also, the persisting coronavirus-related risks are expected to have caused supply-chain disruptions along with dismal store traffic on account of travel and other local restrictions like retail closures in China.In first-quarter 2023, our model predicts North America and international revenues to decline 29.4% and 27.6%, year over year to $450.3 million and $292.4 million, respectively. On the other hand, North America gross billings are expected to decline 30.5% in the quarter to be reported.Mattel, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMattel, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseMattel, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Mattel, Inc. QuoteThe bottom line is likely to have been affected by inventory obsolescence expense, higher input cost inflation, unfavorable fixed cost absorption and higher royalty costs. These costs are expected to have negatively impacted the company’s operations and hurt margins in the to-be-reported quarter. For the first quarter, our model predicts adjusted gross margin to decline 450 points year over year.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model doesn’t conclusively predict an earnings beat for Mattel this time around.

127,6c593235-0e83-34df-8412-794ce0603d27,NEE,2023-04-22,Analysts Estimate TC Energy (TRP) to Report a Decline in Earnings: What to Look Out for,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/analysts-estimate-tc-energy-trp-140002151.html,1682085602,STORY,"['TRP', 'NEE']","[TC Energy (TRP) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 28, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis energy infrastructure company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.86 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -2.3%.Revenues are expected to be $3.01 billion, up 9.1% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.46% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for TC Energy?For TC Energy, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +0.58%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #4.So, this combination makes it difficult to conclusively predict that TC Energy will beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that TC Energy would post earnings of $0.84 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.82, delivering a surprise of -2.38%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.TC Energy doesn't appear a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Alternative Energy - Other industry, NextEra Energy Partners (NEP), is soon expected to post earnings of $0.46 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -73.3%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $415.85 million, up 48% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for NextEra Energy Partners has remained unchanged over the last 30 days. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 28.96%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that NextEra Energy Partners will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The new policy will not apply to companies that have applications pending.The measure is one in a series of new orders announced by the DOE's office of fossil energy and carbon management aimed at keeping the U.S. on track to meet its goal of net zero emissions by 2050 while supplying allies with natural gas.The U.S. has approved over 49 billion cubic feet per day of LNG for non-Free Trade Agreement (FTA) country exports - of which more than half are held by LNG projects that are not operating or under construction and have asked for extensions for when they will commence exports.This new policy ""will allow DOE to better assess whether new non-FTA applications are in the public interest; provide more certainty to the U.S. and global LNG export markets; and ensure that DOE is making decisions utilizing the latest market information and analytical tools available,"" the DOE said in a statement.A DOE official said it would help newer LNG projects that use more modern technology and pollution controls to compete for approval.The agency also announced that it has made a decision on two pending applications. It will approve a first-time request by Port Arthur LNG, LLC and Sempra to extend the start date at the Texas terminal to 2028, and reject a second extension request by Energy Transfer's Lake Charles Exports' project in Lake Charles, Louisiana.In a related move, the DOE also issued a request for information from LNG industry participants on Friday on strategies and technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants throughout the LNG process.The DOE has been working on setting standards for certified natural gas, a form of the fuel that producers market as climate friendly.(Reporting by Valerie Volcovici)]"
134,4f176647-9a0c-3023-9915-7506afd57730,MA,2023-04-22,"UPDATE 1-US natgas eases on forecasts for milder weather, less heating demand",Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/1-us-natgas-eases-forecasts-185515812.html,1682103315,STORY,['NG=F'],"[(Adds latest prices) April 21 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas futures eased about 1% on Friday on forecasts for a little less cold weather and lower heating demand over the next two weeks than previously expected. That small decline came even though the amount of gas flowing to U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) export plants remained on track to hit a record high for a second month in a row in April after Freeport LNG's export plant in Texas exited an eight-month outage in February. Front-month gas futures for May delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange fell 1.6 cents, or 0.7%, to settle at $2.233 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). For the week, the contract rose about 5% for a second week in a row. Data provider Refinitiv said average gas flows to the seven big U.S. LNG export plants rose to 14.1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) so far in April, up from a record 13.2 bcfd in March. Those seven big U.S. LNG export plants can turn about 13.8 bcfd of gas into LNG. LNG plants can pull in a little more gas than they can turn into LNG because they use some of the fuel to power equipment used to produce LNG. Some analysts have begun to question whether low gas prices in Europe and Asia could force U.S. LNG exporters to cancel cargoes again this summer after mostly mild weather this winter left massive amounts of gas in storage. In 2020, at least 175 LNG shipments were canceled due to oversupply and weak demand. ""In Europe, storage is tracking near 2020 levels, leading to some concern that prices could follow 2020’s path, with spreads between global and U.S. prices narrowing to close export arbs (arbitrage) and shut LNG exports to prevent a global storage containment issue,"" analysts at Bank of America said in a note. Gas stockpiles in northwestern Europe - Belgium, France, Germany and the Netherlands - were currently about 56% of capacity, keeping the amount of gas in storage about 63% above its five-year (2018-2022) average for this time of year, according to Refinitiv. That is much healthier than U.S. gas inventories, which also contain excess gas after a mild winter and were at about 21% above their five-year norm. To ensure that Europe has enough gas for the winter heating season, the European Union wants utilities to refill stockpiles during the summer injection season to 90% of capacity by Nov. 1. Analysts at ClearView Energy Partners, a research firm, noted ""a scenario where European storage fills much earlier than last year and Asian demand growth does not materialize could reduce LNG margins further, potentially resulting in the cancellation of (U.S. LNG) cargoes once again."" Currently, however, the ""window for shipping U.S. LNG to Asia and Europe remains open,"" ClearView said. Gas was trading near a 21-month low of $13 per mmBtu at the Dutch Title Transfer Facility (TTF) in Europe and a 22-month low of $12 at the Japan Korea Marker (JKM) in Asia. SUPPLY AND DEMAND U.S. gas futures lag far behind global prices because the U.S. is the world's top producer with all the fuel it needs for domestic use, while capacity constraints prevent the country from exporting more LNG. Refinitiv said average gas output in the U.S. Lower 48 states rose to 100.2 bcfd so far in April, up from 99.7 bcfd in March. That compares with a monthly record of 100.4 bcfd in January. With temperatures expected to decline in coming days, Refinitiv forecast U.S. gas demand, including exports, would rise from 95.0 bcfd this week to 96.6 bcfd next week before sliding to 93.4 bcfd in two weeks as the weather turns seasonally milder. The forecasts for this week and next were lower than Refinitiv's outlook on Thursday.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of these stocks, go directly to 5 Best Silver Mining Stocks To Buy Now.Global economic conditions, geopolitical events, currency fluctuations, and investment demand have all impacted the silver industry in the past few months. The prices of the rare metal can often be volatile, impacting the profitability and viability of silver mining operations. Over the past few years, declining ore grades, increasing production costs, regulatory compliance, community relations, and environmental concerns have also all weighed on the industry. However, silver mining firms have dealt with these challenges in their stride. The global silver mining industry has been steadily producing silver for various industrial applications, jewelry, and investment purposes. According to data from the Silver Institute, global silver mine production for 2023 is expected to be 1.055 billion oz. The top silver producing countries in the world who will benefit from this include Mexico, Peru, China, Russia, and Australia. Mexico has been the world's largest producer of silver for many years, followed by Peru. These countries account for a significant portion of global silver production.There are numerous mining companies involved in silver mining globally, ranging from large multinational corporations to smaller regional and local operators. Some of the major silver mining companies include Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), and Hecla Mining Company (NYSE:HL), among others discussed in detail below. Silver has a wide range of industrial applications, including electronics, solar panels, medical instruments, and automotive components, which drive demand for silver. As a result, industrial demand for silver is a significant factor in the global silver mining industry. Silver is also used as a store of value and an investment asset, with demand coming from investors who seek exposure to precious metals. Silver is often used for investment purposes in the form of bars, coins, and exchange-traded products (ETFs), which can impact the demand for silver and subsequently the silver mining industry. Sustainability and responsible mining practices are important considerations for many stakeholders in the industry.Story continuesOur MethodologyFor this article, we selected mining stocks that have interests in the silver business based on overall hedge fund sentiment.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Al Gore's sustainable investing, and go directly to read 5 Best Environmental Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Al Gore. Al Gore is an American politician, investor, environmentalist, and advocate for climate action. In addition to his political career, Al Gore is widely known for his work in raising awareness about climate change and promoting environmental activism. He is the founder and chairman of The Climate Reality Project, a non-profit organization focused on climate education and advocacy. He co-founded Generation Investment Management (GIM) in 2004, which follows a peculiar investment approach. The hedge fund employs a variety of strategies to identify and invest in sustainable companies, including analyzing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, engaging with company management to encourage sustainable practices, and seeking out companies that are leaders in their industries in terms of sustainability.Earlier this year, Gore spoke about climate change at an annual meeting of the World Economic Forum’s session at Davos. He said that the crisis is worsening at a rapid pace. He also lauded Greta Thunberg’s recent actions to prevent the expansion of coal mines in Germany. Here are some comments from the environmentalist:“There are a lot of words and there are some meaningful commitments, but we are still failing badly. We need to have a supermajority process instead of unanimity in the COP.

These stakes have a total value of over $3.78 billion. Davis Advisers mentioned Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in its annual 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“If Berkshire represents “growing value” then Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) might be said to represent “undervalued growth.” Founded more than a half century ago, Applied Materials has grown to be the largest supplier of manufacturing tools, services and software to the semiconductor industry. Holding more than 15,000 patents, Applied has become the irreplaceable supplier to the critical global growth industry, semiconductors. Because this company’s earnings can be uneven, short-sighted investors often label this company as “cyclical” and assign it a relatively low valuation.We disagree and, having perused more than 50 years of data, conclude that Applied is unquestionably a growth company trading at a value price. Figure 8 shows the two sustainable drivers of this growth. The green bars indicate that semiconductor manufacturers have grown industry revenue at 7.5% over the last decade, more than three times the growth of the U.S. economy over this same decade. The orange line indicates that the percentage of this revenue that the industry commits to capital spending has gradually risen from roughly 20% to 30%. Putting these two trends together, it should come as no surprise that Applied has grown revenue at a rate of 11%, and operating income at more than 19% over this same time period.In the near term, the impact of the chip industry’s post-pandemic inventory correction, which could reduce equipment demand, may more than offset the benefit of recent supply chain issues that limited Applied Materials’ ability to meet customer demand. Longer term, geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. are driving investment in potentially redundant chip production globally, while at the same time the U.S. and her allies are restricting export of leading edge production tools into China. Even though the near term is frustratingly veiled in uncertainty, the recent shortages and trade restrictions have firmly established that access to chip-production technology is essential to every major industrial economy. Given this, we see more opportunity than risk and estimate that Applied Materials could sell at about 10 times what the company could be earning three-to-five years from now.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Environmental Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Al Gore. Suggested articles:Cathie Wood’s Stock Portfolio: 2023 Stock Picks12 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates10 Eyecare Stocks with Upside PotentialDisclosure.

To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 largest coal mining companies in USA.One of the most controversial industries of our time, the U.S. coal industry has been the target of climate change activists for a while now, but regardless, still enjoyed a bumper 2022. Before we discuss 2022, let's discuss some of the trends in the past several years, going back to two decades, which have had a huge impact on what was once one of the biggest industries in the country.After climate change started to be taken seriously by most governments in developed countries, laws and regulations aiming to incentivize renewable energy companies and discourage fossil fuel consumption started to be passed, which is also why the most advanced countries in renewable energy are dominated by developed nations. In 2019, coal production had fallen 40% from the peak achieved in 2008, while in the last century, coal employees have fallen from nearly 900,000 to just 43,000. Because of these regulations, several coal giants, including some corporations which were among the largest coal mining companies in USA, had to file for bankruptcy. In 2015 alone, four listed coal companies filed for bankruptcy, including the fourth-largest such company at the time in Alpha Natural Resources. By 2016 alone, around a quarter of all coal companies had filed for bankruptcy or were in the bankruptcy process as mining downturn hit the industry severely. Between 2011 to 2016, the price of coal had fallen by 50% and the industry overall was heavily in debt to the tune of billions of dollars.12 largest mining companies in USACopyright: vyacheslavsvetlichnyy / 123RF Stock PhotoIn the U.S., coal production is heavily focused in a few states, with Wyoming being the biggest coal producer in the country by a mile, accounting for over 41% of total production, while Wyoming, Pennsylvania and West Virginia combined account for over 60% of the company's total coal production. One of the main reasons behind the decline of coal has been the focus on alternative sources, both renewable and non-renewable. While the biggest growth is easily witnessed by some of the largest renewable energy companies by market cap, even natural gas electricity production increased to 38% of the country's total electricity production in 2022, 1% up from 2021 and will then fall back to 36% in 2023. Meanwhile, coal electricity production fell from 23% in 2021 to 20% in 2022 while the decline will continue in 2023, falling to 19%.Story continuesWhile the last several years have not been very positive for the coal mining industry, 2022 was a bumper year for the industry overall, after oil prices increased significantly and an energy crisis gripped Europe due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Russia is among the biggest oil and gas exporters in the world, and after its war with Ukraine, sanctions were imposed by Western nations and European nations looked elsewhere for energy supplies, all of which was a boon to the coal industry. According to the International Energy Agency, global coal consumption reached a new high in 2022 even though the increase has been expected to be temporary. Global coal consumption in 2022 exceeded 8 billion tonnes in 2022, which was a boon to some of the largest coal mining companies in USA. Hallador Energy Company (NASDAQ:HNRG) saw 1 year returns of 72.2%, CONSOL Energy Inc. (NYSE:CEIX) saw a one year share price increase of 31% and Alliance Resource Partners, L.P. (NASDAQ:ARLP) saw a return of 30.7% in the same time period, just to give a few examples of how coal companies profited in 2022.As mentioned earlier, this boon is expected to be temporary, and the World Bank has stated that coal prices are expected to decline in the medium term but prices are still much higher than the 2017 - 2021 average. China and India led record global consumption while exports were increased by Colombia and South Africa. Meanwhile, in Australia and South Africa, benchmark coal prices fell by around 50% from peaks earned in September 2022 and April 2022 respectively. Coal future prices have also declined considerably in 2023 as compared to 2022 but if gas prices rise further in 2023, this could create more demand for coal and hence, lead to a price increase there. Further risks to the coal industry include global growth falling below forecasts and China's economic revitalization after its abandonment of the nation's zero-Covid policy fails to materialize. One of the largest coal mining companies in the USA, Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) mentioned in its Q4 2022 earnings call ""So for 2023, we have a solid sales book, as we stated. We are completely sold out both in the PRB and our other U.S. thermal mines. So we have a really strong hand there. And so far, the shipments have been going. The nominations have been there and the demand has been there. Our customers, particularly our PRB customers are still short of their target inventories even though they're burning less coal are still short of their inventory. So the demand is there. The challenge we're having is with rail service in the PRB, which was a challenge we had last year and has continued into the start of this year, still with crew shortages, but also there's been some tough weather in the PRB. We are expecting to see that turn around here in the coming months, both railroads have additional crews coming on in February this month. So we're expecting to see some improvements in the rail performance. And at the moment, that really, Lucas, is nothing that I would say that we're seeing from the customer side. It's more of a transportation issue, which is a carryover from last year.""The top two largest coal mining companies in the USA alone account for over 30% of all production in the country. To calculate our ranking, we have considered their coal production in 2021 based on data from the International Energy Agency, and market cap as at 20th April 2023, with data taken from Yahoo Finance.

Now forecast comes despite US export restrictions on the latest chip making technologies.Meanwhile, the US is working to develop its chip making infrastructure. For more on the current direction of the semiconductor industry, let's get to Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre. Hey, Ines.INES FERRE: Hey, Rochelle. Yeah, and those two companies, well known companies when it comes to manufacturing of semiconductors or the equipment to manufacture semiconductors are LAM Research that's based out of California, and also ASML Holdings and that's based out of the Netherlands.So they're both expecting strong demand coming out of China. Now, the US, last year, had announced that it was imposing some restrictions on exports into China of certain chips, and also manufacturing tools for those chips. But that involves the more advanced chips. So you still see chips that are going into the EV vehicles, for example. The demand for those are growing in China.And those are the types of chips that we're talking about when it comes to the Chinese customers for ASML and for LAM. When it comes to that strong demand that they are seeing, that will continue out of China. So LAM and ASML say that these Chinese customers are buying tools for building the less advanced chips, those chips that go into EVs, those chips that go into mobile phones that also go into laptops.And this is all happening really when you are seeing each region of the world or the major regions of the world, trying to become more self-sufficient when it comes to making chips because of the supply chain issues that we saw during the pandemic and also because of security concerns as well.Story continuesSo Europe just approved an EU Chips Act that's aimed at building capacity for building chips in and out of the EU, also making the EU just basically more self-sufficient in trying to avoid those supply chain issues that I just mentioned. As far as where the chip sector is going, analysts are seeing a recovery in the second half of 2023 after an inventory digestion. And you just had a Jefferies analyst that have a buy rating on LAM saying, investors are underestimating the potential for a v-shaped recovery, which is often what happens after a material inventory correction, Rochelle.- And then also honing in on TSMC, what do their latest results say about the chip space?INES FERRE: Yeah, basically, what they are-- they revised down their full year sales outlook, so they're expecting their revenue to be a little bit lower. But nevertheless, their CapEx is remaining unchanged. That's a capital expenditure.

These goals reflect our belief that environmental sustainability is extremely important, with significant social and economic benefits that require collective action and leadership from our Company and other corporate citizens.In line with our commitments, our strategy to achieve net-zero includes transitioning to renewable energy in our top operational footprint regions via long-term Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), decarbonizing our operations through the replacement of high global warming potential gases in our manufacturing processes and reducing natural gas usage at our San Diego, California, headquarters. We also joined the Climate Pledge, a cross-sector community of companies committed to be net-zero by 2040 - 10 years ahead of the Paris Agreement's goals.During our first full year of implementing this strategy, we've already made progress. Our 10-year renewable energy agreement with Shell Energy North America (US), L.P. (Shell Energy) has reduced our emissions by 25,785 tCO2 e, or 10 percent, of our total Scope 1 and 2 emissions since last year. Our solar PPA in Bangalore, India, (which began in 2018) continues to make a substantial contribution to our Scope 2 emission reductions in the amount of 15,284 tCO2 e (17,855 MWhrs) annually. We are also seeking to enter into long-term renewable energy agreements in our other top operational footprint regions of Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), India and Singapore.Furthermore, in 2022, we reduced our consumption of natural gas at our German manufacturing facility by 50 percent by shutting down our combined heat and power plant. The remaining 50 percent of natural gas is used in waste air treatment to reduce emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and GHG emissions from manufacturing processes exhaust. To mitigate the climate impact from the remaining natural gas, we offset our consumption through green biogas certificates, which are produced in Europe from renewable plant material.Story continuesFollowing the successful test phase of our Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) chamber clean project in 2021 at our German manufacturing facility, we continued to implement gas replacement in all PECVD chamber clean processes. The project replaces high global warming potential gases such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6 ) and nitrogen trifluoride (NF3 ) with a fluorine-based gas mixture that has a global warming potential of zero, thereby reducing our Scope 1 GHG emissions.Finally, we also implemented an internal carbon price across our three manufacturing facilities, as appropriate. This carbon price creates an assumed cost per ton of carbon emissions with an annual rate increase per year, with the objective of changing our internal behavior toward low carbon innovation.Learn more in Qualcomm's 2022 Corporate Responsibility ReportQualcomm, Friday, April 21, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Qualcomm on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: QualcommWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/qualcommEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: QualcommView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/750627/How-Qualcomm-is-Addressing-the-Climate-Challenge]"

At the same time, we also recognize the environmental toll that today's travel industry often has on the planet. Climate action is essential to preserving the many destinations our travelers are looking to experience. Sustainability is more than an accelerating trend for travel - it's fundamental for the future of our industry.Responsible travel is a key business imperative for Expedia Group. Among other motivations, our travelers are clearly demanding more sustainable options. In fact, terms related to sustainability and eco-friendliness were mentioned in traveler feedback twice as often last year as in previous years 1.To meet our travelers' demand and as part of our long-term sustainability efforts, last April, Expedia Group signed the Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Travel and Tourism as one signal of our commitment. And in September, we launched our Open World™ social impact and sustainability strategy with the specific mission of advancing a travel ecosystem that is open, accessible, and responsible for all.We are excited to share an update on our progress over the last year and outline our vision for what's ahead.BUILDING A PROSPEROUS PLANETOur Open World framework places environmental sustainability alongside two other pillars of social impact - inclusive access and economic mobility - with all three driving toward a responsible future for tourism and for the people, places, and communities that make up global travel.The Prosperous Planet pillar of our strategy is grounded in two commitments:Aligning with a Net Zero Future - We will decarbonize our operations and take action to mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change on our business.Powering Sustainable Journeys - We will innovate sustainable solutions for the future of travel, empowering travelers to act more sustainably and supporting partners in offering more sustainable travel options.Story continuesExpedia Group is committed to mobilizing its vast network of travelers, partners, and peers to empower more responsible choices.SETTING A VISIONOver the past year, we've collected data and had critical conversations with many stakeholders as we create our first Climate Action Plan, set to be released later this year. Outlining our overall climate vision and strategy, the Climate Action Plan articulates six core elements that will guide our action over the coming years:Reduce: Set and deliver science-aligned targets and decarbonization strategies for our operations.Prepare: Evaluate and integrate climate risk and opportunity to our business, including the outcomes of a scenario analysis, which describes how the physical and transition risks of climate change might impact our business.Adapt: Support community disaster response and climate adaptation to build resilience in the places where we work, and the destinations where we travel.Align: Advance industry standards to support clear, authentic, and consistent information on the sustainability of travel products.Recognize: Promote more sustainable travel options across our platforms and incentivize travelers to choose them.Accelerate: Support suppliers in providing more sustainable offerings, with a focus on the intersection of climate and equity.GREENER OPTIONS FOR A GREENER TRAVEL INDUSTRYCollaboration is critical to our progress as an industry, and we must work together to innovate and accelerate meaningful change. Expedia Group is committed to empowering both travelers and partners to make more responsible and sustainable travel choices by providing needed insights, tools, and resources.DESTINATION COMMUNITIESTravel is inherently place-based. That's why our Open World strategy puts destination communities alongside travelers at its center - outstanding travel experiences require vibrant and resilient destinations. We are therefore proud to be partnering with the Travel Foundation to launch a first-of-its-kind capacity-building program for destination marketing and management organizations (DMOs), enabling them to lead the way on climate action in tourism and catalyze meaningful change at a local level. DMOs bridge the gap between the global and the local within the travel industry, and Expedia Group sees them as a key node for accelerating sustainable travel.The program will offer practical training to DMO staff, creating ""climate champions"" that can apply a sustainability lens to strategic planning and decision-making. It will also support DMOs in creating their own climate action plans and offer peer-to-peer learning opportunities for destinations to share knowledge and insights with one another.The program's pilot cohort will launch over the summer. We're excited to name Destination Vancouver as the first DMO to sign on as a participant and look forward to scaling this work in the years to come.TRAVELERSWith operations in 70+ countries and across 200+ travel sites, we interact with millions of travelers. We want to provide credible and clear information, including on sustainability, whether they be carbon estimates or indications of other eco-friendly attributes and practices of travel providers.Trends in travel evolve, and we know that travelers are seeking experiences that are more than just about relaxation or exploration. We increasingly hear that travelers expect options in line with their values, with more information about the environmental and community impacts of their choices.A report by our Expedia Group Media Solutions team highlighted that 90% of consumers look for sustainable options when traveling, though 70% feel overwhelmed navigating available options and on starting the process of becoming a more sustainable traveler 2.Expedia Group is working to build trusted sustainability information for travelers into our products that align with industry best practices, including methodologies developed collaboratively between our peers within the Travalyst Coalition.Product features being tested include displaying estimates of flight emissions, the sustainability practices of hotels, and electric and hybrid vehicle filters for car rentals. Some of these features have never before been available on our sites, and we are excited to continue innovating, evolving, and enhancing the sustainability information we provide to travelers.LOOKING AHEADExpedia Group is charting a course for a more sustainable travel industry. Our Open World social impact and sustainability strategy outlines our commitment, and our forthcoming Climate Action Plan will deepen our vision and roadmap for success. We will continue to collaborate with our peers, partners, travelers, and destinations across the industry to ensure responsible travel on a truly prosperous planet for generations to come.Find more details on our plans and progress here.Data Sources1 Expedia Group, traveler reviews data, January 2021-January 20222 Expedia Group Media Solutions, Sustainable Travel Study, 2022View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Expedia Group on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Expedia GroupWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/expedia-groupEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Expedia GroupView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/750619/Creating-a-More-Sustainable-Travel-Industry]"

The fellow bemoaned the fact he couldn’t find any companies that met his investment criteria. He wanted companies with strong growth profiles and cash flow, good returns on capital, excellent management teams and great balance sheets with low valuations. He exclaimed “I can’t find any companies that meet all those criteria!”. Bill chuckled, “Yeah, I want all that too, and can’t find any of those either.""Market prices reflect fundamentals. If everything is wonderful, valuations reflect that. On the other hand, low valuations generally reflect some perceived problem. Stock prices are driven by revisions to expectations.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.""Trendlines Over Headlines""On April 12 Piper Sandler's chief market technician, Craig Johnson, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the current market situation and his market outlook. According to Johnson, the market is going to undergo 3 phases: ""a hop, and drop, and a pop"", and right now we are in a ""hop"" phase. According to Johnson, the S&amp;P 500 has the potential to trade up to anywhere between 4,200 and 4,300 during the ""hop"" phase. As for the ""drop"" phase, Johnson expects the market to decline when the Fed decides to cut interest rates, which he expects will happen in the middle of 2023 or possibly in the third quarter of 2023.Craig Johnson noted that ""great downturn reversals have already occurred"" over the past 24 months on the Dow, the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ, the Russell 2000, and the Dow Jones Transportation Average as well. According to Craig Johnson, we have had ""a series of higher highs and higher lows"" and when we look at the lows that were made in September and October 2022, we observe that at that point in time the market was extremely oversold. Here are some comments from Craig Johnson:""If you come back and you look at history, all the way back to 1929, when you look at the fact that we haven't seen in the first quarter (of 2023) a break back below the December lows of last year (2022). That has historically been a pretty bullish sign for the market. In fact, when you look back in time, the market is typically 83% of the time higher, with about 13.7% annual return, when you don't break back below those December lows in the first quarter of the new year. And that's exactly what we are seeing happen this year.""Story continuesWhile the markets may undergo a correction, according to Craig Johnson, investors should focus on the long term for 2023. Craig Johnson expects the S&amp;P 500 to move up to 4,625 by the end of the year. Here is what Craig Johnson of Piper Sandler said:""If you look at some of the underlying indices, clearly, it is trendlines over headlines at this point in time... All the negativity out there at this point in time, stocks aren't going down. They're starting to trend higher and we really need to pay attention to that fact.""Craig Johnson thinks that the National Bureau of Economic Research will officially declare a recession in the back half of 2023. He noted that once a recession is official, ""history shows that you typically backdate that recession's start date by about 7.6 months"". Out of all the recessions since 1929, it was only in 2002 that the market did not bottom, said Johnson, and he thinks that after the market bottoms the S&amp;P 500 will ""pop"" back to 4,625.Craig Johnson further noted that he sees the Fed starting to cut interest rates in July 2023, or possibly after that, and this will lead to a ""quick drop"" in the markets. Craig Johnson talked about investor positioning right now and said:""We're at levels right now that we have seen only at the lows of the market in 2020, 2011, and 2007. The world is already very negatively positioned, and any drop will get bought from our perspective.""While Craig Johnson's market outlook offers valuable insights into the broader market, investors can also consider the individual stocks recommended by Fast Money traders to identify potential near-term opportunities. Fast Money is a popular TV show on CNBC that offers daily stock picks and market insights from a group of experienced traders.

While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses.

However, pandemic-induced supply-chain disruption in the U.S. defense electronics space remains a threat to the industry players. Nevertheless, the outlook remains bright for the defense side of the aerospace-defense industry, buoyed by a solid budget proposal, which should keep investors interested in this industry. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are Lockheed Martin LMT, Northrop Grumman NOC and General Dynamics GD.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology (IT) services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of revenues comes from defense contractors, offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services and supply chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in a report published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in February 2023, industry-wide revenue per kilometer increased 55.5% year over year. IATA projects a solid recovery for aircraft deliveries in 2023, with a total of 1,540 aircraft scheduled to be delivered this year, up 24% from 2022. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace manufacturers, which have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of their orders altogether by airlines.Expanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention the U.S. fiscal 2024 defense budget request of $842 billion for the Pentagon, which indicates a 3.2% improvement from fiscal 2023’s enacted amount. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which should enhance their top line.Supply Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption has been observed in the Aerospace and Defense industry, of late, courtesy of pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected smaller suppliers, like aircraft parts makers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace and the aftermarket business. Although the global economy has started to improve, lingering market disequilibria will likely continue to keep prices high, including that of labor, as estimated by IATA. This, in turn, might keep the growth trajectory of the U.S. aerospace and defense industry constricted, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to Industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines’ operations, which are already burdened with high inflation and jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve’s policy rate now stands at 4.75%, having started 2022 at 0.25%, and will likely peak in 2023 to the vicinity of 5%, as reported by IATA. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines, which earn revenues in non-U.S. currency. Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars.

You can skip our detailed analysis of Al Gore's sustainable investing, and go directly to read 5 Best Environmental Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Al Gore. Al Gore is an American politician, investor, environmentalist, and advocate for climate action. In addition to his political career, Al Gore is widely known for his work in raising awareness about climate change and promoting environmental activism. He is the founder and chairman of The Climate Reality Project, a non-profit organization focused on climate education and advocacy. He co-founded Generation Investment Management (GIM) in 2004, which follows a peculiar investment approach. The hedge fund employs a variety of strategies to identify and invest in sustainable companies, including analyzing environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, engaging with company management to encourage sustainable practices, and seeking out companies that are leaders in their industries in terms of sustainability.Earlier this year, Gore spoke about climate change at an annual meeting of the World Economic Forum’s session at Davos. He said that the crisis is worsening at a rapid pace. He also lauded Greta Thunberg’s recent actions to prevent the expansion of coal mines in Germany. Here are some comments from the environmentalist:“There are a lot of words and there are some meaningful commitments, but we are still failing badly. We need to have a supermajority process instead of unanimity in the COP. We cannot let oil companies, gas companies, and petro-states tell us what is permissible.”In May 2022, GIM launched a $1.7 billion Sustainable Solutions Fund IV, which focuses on investing in high-growth companies that are leaders in sustainability, with a particular focus on those that are driving positive environmental and social impact. In our previous article, we also reported that this fund is collaborating with other ESG-centric programs to make investments in reducing global warming levels.Story continuesAt the end of the fourth quarter of 2022, Generation Investment Management’s 13F portfolio had a total value of over $17.3 billion, compared with $16.8 billion in the previous quarter.

These stakes have a total value of over $3.78 billion. Davis Advisers mentioned Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) in its annual 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“If Berkshire represents “growing value” then Applied Materials, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMAT) might be said to represent “undervalued growth.” Founded more than a half century ago, Applied Materials has grown to be the largest supplier of manufacturing tools, services and software to the semiconductor industry. Holding more than 15,000 patents, Applied has become the irreplaceable supplier to the critical global growth industry, semiconductors. Because this company’s earnings can be uneven, short-sighted investors often label this company as “cyclical” and assign it a relatively low valuation.We disagree and, having perused more than 50 years of data, conclude that Applied is unquestionably a growth company trading at a value price. Figure 8 shows the two sustainable drivers of this growth. The green bars indicate that semiconductor manufacturers have grown industry revenue at 7.5% over the last decade, more than three times the growth of the U.S. economy over this same decade. The orange line indicates that the percentage of this revenue that the industry commits to capital spending has gradually risen from roughly 20% to 30%. Putting these two trends together, it should come as no surprise that Applied has grown revenue at a rate of 11%, and operating income at more than 19% over this same time period.In the near term, the impact of the chip industry’s post-pandemic inventory correction, which could reduce equipment demand, may more than offset the benefit of recent supply chain issues that limited Applied Materials’ ability to meet customer demand. Longer term, geopolitical tensions between China and the U.S. are driving investment in potentially redundant chip production globally, while at the same time the U.S. and her allies are restricting export of leading edge production tools into China. Even though the near term is frustratingly veiled in uncertainty, the recent shortages and trade restrictions have firmly established that access to chip-production technology is essential to every major industrial economy. Given this, we see more opportunity than risk and estimate that Applied Materials could sell at about 10 times what the company could be earning three-to-five years from now.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Environmental Dividend Stocks To Buy According To Al Gore. Suggested articles:Cathie Wood’s Stock Portfolio: 2023 Stock Picks12 Best Dividend Stocks For Rising Interest Rates10 Eyecare Stocks with Upside PotentialDisclosure.

If you want to skip a detailed analysis including the pros and cons of diversified companies, go directly to the 5 Best Diversified Stocks to Buy Now.During the current economic turmoil and volatility, investing in companies with diversified products and service portfolios can be beneficial. In 2022, many indexes in the financial markets suffered a steep decline due to several industries falling prey to rising interest rates and inflation. At the end of the year, NASDAQ was down by 34%, the S&amp;P 500 index was down by almost 20%, and Dow Jones recorded a decline of 8.8%. In such economic downturns, companies with diverse product portfolios can shield themselves better as one segment's gains can offset the losses of another within the firm.One case that can be made for conglomerates or diversified companies is that renowned American investors like Warren Buffett, David Tepper, Michael Larson, and Richard S. Pzena have significant investments in diversified companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). Some advantages of many diversified companies are that most of them are cash-rich well-established blue-chip stocks that can remain stable during market downturns. This trend can be seen in the Dow Jones index, a collection of 30 of the finest blue-chip stocks that suffered the least during the tough macroeconomic conditions of 2022. A healthy cash position also means that these companies will not shy away from shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Diversification also helps a company expand its customer base and face fewer threats from the competition.11 Best Diversified Stocks to Buy NowOur MethodologyAfter careful market analysis, we found and listed down the best companies that have diversified product portfolios. We listed the companies according to their hedge fund sentiment which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds. Moreover, we skipped some companies that have diverse portfolios of products and services because they generate most of their revenue from a single source.Story continuesBest Diversified Stocks to Buy Now11. Sea Limited (NYSE:SE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) is a tech conglomerate based in Singapore. It initially started as a game developer in 2009. However, in addition to its game development platform, the company now owns two banks, a Singaporean soccer team, a digital payment platform, and an e-commerce company.A total of 48 hedge funds had stakes in the company as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. Kora Management owned over 3.97 million shares of the company in the fourth quarter, making it the hedge fund with the largest stake in Sea Limited (NYSE:SE).Here is what Hayden Capital had to say about Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) reported earnings last week, after which the share price rebounded +36% in a single day. The most obvious question that comes to mind, is why didn’t we sell more last year, when prices were still high? The truth is that we did sell a significant amount, but in hindsight obviously wish we were more aggressive with the sales.For example, we owned the peak number of shares of Sea Ltd in Q1 2020, and steadily trimmed over the next two years. From Q1 2020 to Q1 2022, we trimmed ~39% of our shares over that period. However, the issue was that the investment continued to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio, since the share price appreciated much faster than our sales (+620% from 1Q20 to 3Q21). This was a similar case for our other long-tenured positions as well.So why didn’t we trim more aggressively and just hold cash? The answer is that at its core, I believe that holding cash is implicitly a market timing call. I certainly didn’t foresee a likely recession on the horizon so quickly after the turbulence of Covid already had on the economy. Even in late 2021, after it was clear interest rates would start rising, we were still operating under the assumption that rates would cause valuations to compress, but likely wouldn’t have an impact on the overall earnings trajectory. Given our expectations for strong earnings growth, we thought this could more than offset the valuation compression over time, and would still generate strong IRRs over a 3 – 5 year timeframe…” (Click here to see the full text)10. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 523M Company (NYSE:MMM) is one of the biggest diversified companies, offering thousands of products for different industries.

We believe that the spin-off of General Electric HealthCare Technologies has highlighted the value of General Electric’s remaining business units. General Electric intends to spin out its Power and Renewables business unit early in 2024.”8. Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) is an American mass media and entertainment giant headquartered in New York. The company’s products and services include theme parks, comics, films, video games, sports broadcasting, and streaming services, along with many others. The company was founded in 2022 after the merger of Warner Brothers and Discovery Inc. and it operates globally.Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) has recently been favored by analysts.

(NASDAQ:WBD) in Q4 2022, compared to 61 in Q3 2022.Artisan Partners made the following comment about Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) is a global media and entertainment company that is the result of the 2022 merger of Discovery and WarnerMedia. Warner is known for its theatrical releases, networks (CNN, TNT, TBS) and pay television network HBO and related over-the-top streaming service HBO Max. The legacy Discovery business distributes content across US and international networks—such as HGTV, Discovery, TLC, Food Network and Animal Planet—as well as its own streaming service Discovery+. We believe the total portfolio of content and entertainment assets should provide a compelling direct-to-consumer offering to attract viewers and the scale to invest in original content. There is a lot of opportunity, but there’s also uncertainty related to the merger’s integration and realized cost synergies. These questions, in addition to a challenging macro environment for advertising and foreign exchange headwinds, have been overhangs on the stock price.Further, media and entertainment stocks have come under pressure due to skepticism about the industry’s long-term economics. Our view is streaming is a scale and intellectual property business that will result in a few large winners, and we believe HBO Max will be among this group. WBD looks like a bargain, selling at a double-digit FCF yield.”7.

Each stock was up 1% in the quarter compared to the 16% price decline for the S&amp;P 500 and the positions were reduced as the valuations became somewhat less appealing, though still attractive enough to warrant inclusion.”6. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is an American multi-industry company with various business segments including life sciences, diagnostics, environmental and applied solutions, and dental products. On February 22, with the announcement of an 8% increase to its quarterly dividend, Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) recorded its ninth consecutive year of dividend growth.

The next quarterly dividend will be payable by Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) on April 29, to the shareholders of record on March 31.Stewart Asset Management mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Diversified Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:12 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy Under $2010 Best ASX Stocks to Buy Now14 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy NowDisclosure: None. 11 Best Diversified Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"
152,2af96bb0-7617-311b-a32d-01e7653e7373,JNJ,2023-04-22,Thinking Of Buying Healthpeak Properties? Here Are The Properties And Tenants You'd Be Adding To Your Portfolio,Benzinga,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/thinking-buying-healthpeak-properties-properties-191706101.html,1682104626,STORY,"['PEAK', 'JNJ', '^GSPC']","[Real estate investment trusts (REITs) are one of the most popular income-oriented types of stocks investors can purchase. Receiving monthly or quarterly dividend payments on a regular basis is comforting to those who rely on such payments for ongoing household or other bills.But it’s always important to consider the properties, tenants and contractual agreements that comprise the largest percentage of a REIT’s business to ensure that those payments will continue.Take a look at one healthcare REIT with a slightly different tenant base from most of its peers in the same subsector:Healthpeak Properties Inc. (NYSE: PEAK) is a Denver-based diversified healthcare REIT that owns and operates private-pay facilities such as life science centers, medical offices and continuing care retirement communities. Although it has properties across the country, most of its properties are in the San Francisco, San Diego and Boston areas. Healthpeak Properties’ initial public offering (IPO) was created in 1985, and it was added to the S&amp;P 500 in 2008. It owns 480 properties worth over $20 billion.Healthpeak Properties has approximately 200 tenants in its Life Science centers, and the top 20 tenants represent about 45% of the life science annualized base rents (ABR). Publicly traded companies account for 73% of Healthpeak’s ABR, and about 80% of its ABR comes from companies with market caps over $1 billion. Biotech companies make up the preponderance of Healthpeak Properties’ tenants, with a somewhat even distribution between large-cap, mid-cap, small-cap and private biotech companies.Many of Healthpeak Properties’ life science tenants are large, well-known pharmaceuticals, such as Amgen Inc., Johnson &amp; Johnson, Pfizer Inc. and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.Healthpeak Properties’ emphasis on life sciences is what sets it apart from most other healthcare REITs, which are more involved with hospitals, assisted living facilities and skilled nursing homes. Life science and medical office buildings combined make up about 90% of Healthpeak Properties’ net operating income (NOI).Story continuesThe chart below from Healthpeak Properties’ March 2023 investor presentation shows the 20 largest tenants in its property portfolio. One of the positives that stands out from the chart is the remaining lease term for most of its top tenants. Only four have remaining lease terms of less than five years, and 11 of the 20 have remaining lease terms longer than seven years.Another positive for Healthpeak Properties is its life science portfolio occupancy rate, which was 99% at year-end 2022, up over 2% since 2019. While its medical office occupancy rate was 91.4%, its tenant retention rate average since 2015 is only 81%, which is somewhat low. Each time a tenant does not renew its lease, there are carrying costs until a new tenant is put into place, so Healthpeak Properties still has its work cut out to boost that renewal rate higher.With the growth of an aging Baby Boomer population, the Biotech industry should thrive over the next two decades, as long-term drug research for common diseases will continue. This bodes well for Healthpeak Properties’ ability to improve on its occupancy levels.Here's a summary of some of Healthpeak Properties’ largest tenants:Amgen Inc. (NASDAQ: AMGN) is a Thousand Oaks, California-based American multinational biopharmaceutical company established in 1980. Amgen focuses on molecular biology and biochemistry with a goal to use recombinant DNA technology to provide cures for cancer, arthritis and other autoimmune diseases. It’s been on the Fortune 500 list for 23 years. Amgen’s IPO was in June 1983, and today it’s a member of both the Dow 30 and S&amp;P 500. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) is a Brunswick, New Jersey-based American multinational corporation that develops and sells medical devices, pharmaceuticals and consumer packaged goods. Founded in 1886, it’s in the top 40 of the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations in terms of total revenue. Johnson &amp; Johnson has over 250 subsidiary companies that are based in 60 countries and sells products in 175 countries. Johnson &amp; Johnson’s worldwide sales are close to $100 billion.Johnson &amp; Johnson launched its IPO in 1944, has a market cap of $506.41 billion and is a member of both the Dow 30 and S&amp;P 500. It is one of the most popular stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and has an average daily volume of 8.6 million shares traded.Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (NYSE: BMY) is a New York-based American multinational pharmaceutical company. In 2022 it had revenue of $46.2 billion and is on the Fortune 500 list of the largest U.S. corporations. It manufactures prescription pharmaceuticals and does research and development in biologics for cancer, HIV/AIDS, diabetes and the treatment for several other areas of physical and mental disorders. Bristol-Myers Squibb was founded in 1887 and is a member of the S&amp;P 500.Recent NewsOn Feb. 7, Healthpeak Properties reported its fourth-quarter and full-year 2022 operating results. Adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) of $0.44 were up 7.3% over FFO of $0.41 reported in the fourth quarter of 2021 and a penny above analysts’ estimates. Revenue of $524.47 million was about 1% above the Street’s estimates of $519.38 million and was 8.5% above revenue of $483.2 million from the fourth quarter of 2021.Healthpeak Properties’s $1.70-$1.76 forward guidance of adjusted FFO for 2023 fell short of Wall Street’s consensus estimates of $1.77. That initiated a slew of selling over the next few months that dropped the share price from $28 to a recent closing price of $21.01. In mid-March, the chart of Healthpeak Properties formed a “death cross” — the 50-day moving average crossed below the 200-day moving average.Analysts have not been kind to Healthpeak Properties in recent months. In early April, Citigroup analyst Michael Griffin downgraded Healthpeak Properties from Buy to Neutral, while announcing a price target of $23. Griffin cited its heavy concentration of life science properties in San Francisco, an area that has recently seen declines in other sectors, such as tech.On March 31, Scotiabank analyst Nicholas Yulico also downgraded Healthpeak Properties from Sector Outperform to Sector Perform and announced a price target of $24. Yulico also mentioned a tougher operating environment for Healthpeak Properties’ life science properties over the next year.It’s been almost four months since an analyst has seen the value in Healthpeak Properties. On Jan. 3, Jefferies analyst Jonathan Petersen upgraded Healthpeak Properties from Hold to Buy and raised his price target from $23 to $29.Healthpeak Properties pays a quarterly dividend of $0.30. Its $1.20 annual dividend yields 5.7%. Potential investors should know that the quarterly dividend was cut in February 2021 from $0.37 to $0.30 per share and has not seen an increase since that time. Its forward FFO of $1.74 covers the $1.20 dividend with a payout ratio of 68.9%, and the price/FFO ratio (P/FFO) at 12.2 is reasonable.Despite its strong, well-established tenant base and decent dividend yield, Healthpeak Properties’ one-year total return is negative 35.73%, making it one of the weakest performing of all the healthcare REITs. Its poor performance is largely the result of negative earnings revisions and recent analyst downgrades.It’s been in a long-term downtrend since August 2021 when it traded near $35 per share. The 52-week range is $20.21 to $35.72, and the most recent closing price was less than a dollar above the lows.Healthpeak Properties will announce its first-quarter 2023 operating results after the market closes on April 27. FFO estimates are for $0.08, which would be well below the first-quarter 2022 FFO of $0.43. The consensus estimate on revenue is $522.21 million, which would be an improvement over revenue of $498.37 million achieved in the first quarter of 2022.Over the past five years, private market real estate investments have outperformed the publicly traded REIT market by about 50%.

You can skip our detailed analysis of value and dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Undervalued Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. Undervalued stocks trade at a price lower than their intrinsic or true value. These stocks can potentially be a good investment option for investors who are looking to purchase stocks at a discount and hold them for the long term. If an investor can identify a stock that is undervalued due to temporary factors, such as a downturn in the industry or a negative news event, they may be able to purchase the stock at a lower price and benefit from the potential upside when the temporary factors subside.Growth stocks have outperformed value equities in the past as they offer the potential for higher returns and capital appreciation. However, the consistent changes in monetary policies and growing inflation have turned investors’ attention toward value stocks. According to a report by UBS, value stocks surpassed growth equities by 18 percentage points in the first 10 months of 2022. The report mentioned that inflation above 3% has generally fared well for value stocks historically. In addition to this, tight monetary policies also favor value stocks relative to their growth counterparts. The UBS report revealed that value has historically outperformed growth by an average of 4 percentage points, in the 12 months following the bank’s last rate hike in a cycle.Readers can also have a look at 11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy to know more about value investing.Investors consider value stocks because of their solid long-term returns. This has been proven over the years as value has delivered strong returns to shareholders when compared with growth stocks. Since 1926, value investing returned 1,344,600%, compared with a 626,000% return for growth stocks, as reported by Bank of America. However, growth stocks reasserted their dominance in the recent past when interest rates were low. Investors are often advised to maintain a diversified portfolio, with both value and growth stocks, as it can help them manage risk and achieve their investment goals over the long term.Story continuesIn addition to value stocks, dividend stocks are also becoming popular among investors this year.

The company also is perceived to be somewhat recession-resilient given its strong financial performance during and after the 2008 financial crisis. We took the opportunity to conclude our investment as we have increased concerns over rising competition, supply chain issues related to sourcing semiconductors and the business’s higher-than-perceived cyclicality.”10.

Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.Since 2018, EPD’s dividend yield has gone from 6.5% to 8% with the annual per share payout growing from $1.72 to $1.96, +14%. The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow per share (what could be paid to us if management wanted to) has increased 22%, from $2.73 to $3.33, while leverage has come down a little over ½ a turn. So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio.

This milestone marks the approval of the only system with meal detection technology* that provides automatic adjustments and corrections† to sugar levels every 5 minutes§ for both basal (background) and bolus (mealtime) insulin needs. The system provides insulin to help account for when users occasionally forget to bolus or underestimates the number of carbs in their meal.""Mealtimes prove to be one of the biggest challenges for people living with type 1 diabetes and now for the first time, the MiniMed 780G system addresses this unmet need with automatic, real-time insulin corrections,"" said Que Dallara, EVP and President of Medtronic Diabetes. ""A lot can happen to blood sugars in the span of an hour or even just a few minutes, so we've designed our system for real life – the algorithm adapts to the user and helps compensate for everyday challenges that are quite common around mealtimes. We built in features informed by extensive customer feedback and we're excited to deliver a system with ease of use at the forefront.""Key System FeaturesThe MiniMed 780G system features the lowest glucose target setting (as low as 100 mg/dL) in any automated insulin pump on the market1 and one that more closely mirrors the average glucose of someone not living with diabetes. With this setting, the pump will ""treat to target"" and will automatically deliver basal insulin adjustments and autocorrections to a set target. It's also the only pump with an infusion set that can be worn for up to 7 days, doubling wear time** with advanced materials that help reduce insulin preservative loss, maintain insulin flow and stability, resulting in a reduced risk of infusion set occlusion.2 Combined with the new Guardian™ 4 sensor requiring no fingersticks with SmartGuard™ technology‡, the MiniMed 780G system delivers a user-friendly design with 94% of users saying they're satisfied with the impact the system has on their quality of life3. Importantly, users also reported remaining in SmartGuard™ technology 95% of the time4.Story continues""My last two years on the MiniMed 780G system as part of the clinical trial have been incredible for me,"" said Terry Weland, a Medtronic customer for 25 years. ""The system is so easy to use. I don't know anyone who's perfect at carb counting and there are times when you're not as on top of things as you'd like to be. I don't stress over my diabetes like I used to because I know the system has my back. I love that I can sync my sensor and infusion set changes to every 7 days, which streamlines my routine.""Clinical StudyIn the U.S. pivotal trial of the MiniMed 780G system, users experienced 75% Time in Range (blood sugar between 70-180 mg/dL), with overall Time Below Range of 1.8%5. The system provided even greater protection at night with an overnight Time in Range of 82%, and overnight Time Below Range of 1.5%. With use of the lower target of 100 mg/dL and active insulin time (AIT) set to two hours, Time in Range reached 78.8% without increasing hypoglycemia. These results are mirrored by the real-world evidence across Europe where the MiniMed 780G system has been approved since 2020 and is now available in 105 countries.Results from the randomized controlled ADAPT study evaluating the performance of the MiniMed 780G system1 against multiple daily injections (MDI) used in conjunction with an intermittently scanned CGM (isCGM) reinforced the significant benefits of automated insulin therapy over standard therapy. Initial 6-month results, published in The Lancet Diabetes &amp; Endocrinology, showed AHCL system users experienced a 27.6% increase in Time in Range (TIR) and 1.4% reduction in HbA1C compared to those on MDI + isCGM without increased time in hypoglycemia. This improvement was even greater overnight with a TIR increase of 30.2%. At the close of the 6-month study period, all participants on MDI + isCGM crossed over to the MiniMed 780G system. At one year, these significant improvements were reproduced in this cross-over group and sustained in those that started on AHCL therapy at the start of the trial.The system is approved for users seven years old and above with type 1 diabetes. Medtronic will begin taking pre-orders on May 15, 2023, with first shipments planned for later this summer.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the REIT sector and its outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best REIT Stocks Under $10. A Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate properties. REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders annually in the form of dividends, which makes them an attractive investment option for income-seeking investors. They provide a way for investors to invest in real estate without actually owning physical properties and offer diversification benefits to a portfolio. This has resulted in the growing popularity of REIT stocks among American investors. According to a report by Nareit, approximately 150 million Americans, or roughly 45% of American households have invested in REIT stocks directly or indirectly through mutual funds or exchange-traded funds.In 2022, high-interest rates and growing inflation affected the REIT sector as these economic conditions can also increase the borrowing costs of properties. This results in low profits and falling dividend payments for REIT companies. Last year’s returns also conform to this phenomenon as elevated interest rates caused the REIT sector to decline. The MSCI US REIT Index, which tracks the performance of publicly traded REITs, fell about  26% in 2022 through October 31, compared with a 16.5% decline in the S&amp;P 500 in this period.Despite a challenging period in 2022, analysts are giving a positive outlook for the REITs this year. Edward Pierzak, a senior Vice President of Research at Nareit, spoke with Wealth Management Real Estate about the sector’s position in 2023 so far. He said that though the economic conditions are challenging for the sector, the operational performance of the companies is seemingly more stable. Pierzak gave an insight into the sector’s balance sheet this year. He revealed that year-over-year FFO is up over 10% and net operating income is up 6.8%. Moreover, occupancy rates have also shown a 9.36% growth from the same period last year. This shows that the REIT sector is likely to perform well in 2023.Story continuesHistorical analysis of REIT stocks also shows that they have outperformed other asset classes over the years. In our article titled 11 Best REIT Dividend Stocks, we reported that REITs outperformed diversified core funds by 470 basis points annually over the past 30 years. The report also mentioned that the REIT sector delivered a 10.6% annual average return in the past 15 years, compared with a 6.5% return of the core funds during this period.As dividends are an essential component of the REIT sector, investors consider quality REIT companies with strong dividend policies. Some of the best dividend stocks from the REIT sector include American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD), and Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI).

You can skip our detailed analysis of the pharmaceutical sector and its outlook this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2023. The pharmaceutical industry in the US is one of the largest in the world, representing roughly 50% of the global pharmaceutical sales revenue, as of 2020. The industry consists of a wide range of players, including large multinational corporations, mid-sized and small companies, and biotech startups. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry, as some companies dealing in vaccines or treatments for the virus experienced increased demand for their products. The trend of spending on Covid-related drugs continued through 2022. Some of the biggest pharma companies, like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), among others, are estimated to have generated approximately $100 billion in revenues in 2022, according to a report by Reuters.The current inflationary period has brought defensive stocks into the limelight as these stocks do not get affected by economic cycles. Pharmaceutical companies are often considered to be defensive as they deal in products that are considered essential for the maintenance of health and the treatment of illnesses, and demand for these products may remain relatively stable even during a recession. The sector also delivered positive returns to shareholders last year, when the S&amp;P 500 recorded its worst annual performance since 2008. The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index gained 4.91% from December 2021 to December 2022, compared with a 19.4% decline in the S&amp;P 500 during the same period. The index returned 3.71% in the past 12 months.Though pharma stocks delivered solid returns in 2022, the sector had a comparatively slow year pertaining to merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) deals compared with the previous years. One of the main reasons for this slowdown was that drugmakers acquired companies with authorized and tested drugs and products, instead of companies with products in clinical trials. Moreover, the economic headwinds from inflation and higher interest rates also hindered the deals last year. The deal value in the biopharma sector fell 42% in 2022, compared with 2021, as reported by Ernst &amp; Young.

The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo. At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”6. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70 CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare company that owns a range of retail pharmacy chains.

Vltava Fund mentioned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years. We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt. This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2023. Suggested articles:10 Best FAANG Stocks To Buy Now10 Best Telecom Dividend Stocks To Buy for 202310 Undervalued Lithium Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 3.85%.This large drugmaker’s performance beat earnings expectations in each of the trailing four quarters.

Price and EPS Surprise        Merck &amp; Co., Inc. price-eps-surprise | Merck &amp; Co., Inc. QuoteMerck’s stock has risen 35% in the past year compared with an increase of 10.9% for the industry. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchFactors to ConsiderStrong global underlying demand across its business, particularly for cancer drug Keytruda and HPV vaccine, Gardasil, is likely to have boosted sales growth in the first quarter like several previous quarters.In oncology drugs, Keytruda sales are likely to have been driven by continued strong momentum in metastatic indications and rapid uptake across recent earlier-stage launches. Our model estimate for Keytruda is $5.72 billion.Higher alliance revenues from Lynparza, driven by increased demand, may have boosted oncology sales. Please note that Merck markets Lynparza in partnership with AstraZeneca AZN.AstraZeneca and Merck formed a profit-sharing deal to co-market Lynparza and Koselugo in July 2017.AstraZeneca and Merck’s Lynparza is approved for four cancer types, ovarian, breast, prostate and pancreatic. Lynparza is also being evaluated in an earlier-line setting for the approved cancer indications.Alliance revenues from Lenvima may have also boosted oncology sales.In the hospital specialty portfolio, higher demand due to recovery in surgical procedures and an increase in market share may have benefited sales of neuromuscular blockade medicine — Bridion injection. Our model estimate for Bridion is $407.3 million.Merck and partner Ridgeback Biotherapeutics’ oral antiviral pill to treat COVID-19, Lagevrio (molnupiravir) is unlikely to have been a major contributor to top-line growth in the first quarter. Lagevrio sales should primarily consist of sales from international markets.Story continuesWith regard to the HPV vaccine, Gardasil, ex-U.S. sales are expected to have been driven by strong demand in international markets like China in the first quarter. Sales are expected to have improved in the United States where revenues were hurt due to the unfavorable timing of CDC purchasing in the fourth quarter. Our model estimate for Gardasil is $1.88 billion.Meanwhile, the top line is expected to have witnessed the impact of the loss of U.S. market exclusivity for drugs like Remicade, Noxafil and Zetia. Lower demand and pricing in the United States and generic competition in certain international markets may have hurt sales of the diabetes franchise (Januvia/Janumet).  The drugs lost market exclusivity in China in July and the European Union in September last year.The Animal Health franchise’s sales growth is likely to have improved from the fourth-quarter levels. Our model estimate for the Animal Health unit is $1.58 billion.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Merck time around.

Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.Shares of this pharmaceutical company have returned +9.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. The Zacks Large Cap Pharmaceuticals industry, to which Merck belongs, has gained 9.3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Earnings Estimate RevisionsHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Merck is expected to post earnings of $1.37 per share, indicating a change of -36% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +1.2% over the last 30 days.The consensus earnings estimate of $6.20 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -17.1%. This estimate has changed -9.8% over the last 30 days.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.56 indicates a change of +38% from what Merck is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Merck.The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for MRK _12MonthEPSChartUrlProjected Revenue GrowthWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.In the case of Merck, the consensus sales estimate of $13.84 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -13%. The $58.59 billion and $62.52 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of -1.2% and +6.7%, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryMerck reported revenues of $13.83 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.3%. EPS of $1.62 for the same period compares with $1.80 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13.74 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.65%. The EPS surprise was +3.85%.The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.ValuationWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.The Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Merck is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.ConclusionThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Merck. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The aerospace giant delivered 113 737 jets in the same time frame, indicating a solid 31.4% improvement from 86 units delivered in the year-ago period.The Boeing Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Boeing Company Price and EPS SurpriseThe Boeing Company price-eps-surprise | The Boeing Company QuoteMoreover, Boeing delivered 11 787 Dreamliner jets in the first quarter of 2023, compared to none in the year-ago period, following this product line’s delivery resumption in the third quarter of 2022. This must have also boosted the Boeing Commercial Airplane (BCA) segment’s first-quarter top-line performance.Such significant delivery figures caused a 36.8% surge in the company’s overall commercial deliveries. This, in turn, must have contributed to BCA’s revenues in the quarter under review.The top-line estimate for Boeing’s commercial business segment is pegged at $7,238 million, implying a solid 73.9% improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Earnings ExpectationsOn the cost front, the delivery resumption of the 787 product line is likely to have boosted BCA’s operating profit, thereby adding impetus to its quarterly earnings.Improvements in BCA's financial performance owing to increasing 737 MAX and 787 deliveries and consistent cost management efforts by the BCA team is likely to have contributed to this unit’s first-quarter bottom-line growth.Story continuesFurther, a steady improvement in the company’s expenses is likely to have taken place in relation to the storage of the 737 and 787 aircraft. This is because jets that were in the inventory are gradually getting delivered. Also, the return of the 737 Max in China might have benefited the BCA margin.However, abnormal costs related to the 787 jets are likely to have some impact on Boeing’s first-quarter earnings. So, the overall effect of the aforementioned factors on BCA’s first-quarter earnings performance seems to have been favorable.The bottom-line estimate for BA’s commercial business segment is pegged at a loss of $526.7 million for the first quarter, indicating a solid improvement from the year-ago quarter’s reported loss of $859 million.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Boeing this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

167,afb84514-39af-3844-a64d-8f59cdfac1d7,BA,2023-04-22,Splunk and NIO have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/splunk-nio-highlighted-zacks-bull-105510864.html,1682074510,STORY,"['SPLK', 'BA', 'ERJ']","[For Immediate ReleaseChicago, IL – April 21, 2023 – Zacks Equity Research shares Splunk SPLK as the Bull of the Day and NIO NIO as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on The Boeing Company BA, Spirit AeroSystems SPR and Embraer ERJ.Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:Bull of the Day:Splunk is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) that develops and markets cloud services and licensed software solutions. The stock was a high-flyer back in 2020 as cloud-based stocks were the hot new thing. However, the market became saturated and the cloud bubble popped, bringing Splunk shares down over 70% in two years.The stock looks to have bottomed, almost doubling off its 2021 lows from October. Splunk is now consolidating in a sideways trade since pulling back after a big earnings beat.Investors seem to have accepted the current market price for the stock as they wait for the next catalyst.More About SplunkThe company incorporated in 2003 and is headquartered in San Francisco, California. It employs 8,000 and has a market cap of $15.3 billion.Splunk has a focus in two markets: Security and full-stack monitoring &amp; analysis. Revenues stem from the sale of software licenses, cloud subscriptions, and maintenance and support.The stock has a Zacks Style Score of ""A"" in Growth, but ""F"" in Value. The Forward PE is 33 and the stock pays no dividend.Q4 EarningsSplunk reported earnings in early March, seeing an 84% surprise to the upside. The company also beat on the top line, but issued weak guidance.Splunk guided Q1 revenue at $710-$725M vs the $807M expected and guided FY24 revenues at $3.85-3.9B vs the $4.02B. The numbers were disappointing and the stock sold off about 15% in the week after the earnings release.However, the stock has stabilized and it looks like investors are focusing on the long-term as the stock sees estimates revised upwards for the current year.Estimates MixedShort-term, we still see estimates headed in both directions. While analysts dropped their numbers after the March earnings, we see a small tick higher for the current quarter. Over the last week analysts have lifted estimates a tick, going from -$0.12 to -$0.11.Story continuesFor next quarter, we see a small tick down. Over the last 7 days, we see numbers fall to $0.26 from $0.27.So to go along with the stock, there is a flatlining of the short-term earnings expectations.But when we look to the current year, we see estimates have ticked 8% higher since earnings, going from $2.55 to $2.75. For next year we see a hike of 5%, with analysts lifting numbers from $3.14 to $3.30.Analysts that are bullish on the stock cite significant growth opportunities in the observability, cybersecurity, and core machine search markets. Additionally, Splunk has made cost-saving and operating leverage improvements.The Technical Take Splunk was a cloud darling in 2020, hitting highs of $225. But over the last two years, the stock fell to $65 before rallying to $110.While the stock is well off its lows, its struggling to break away from its 200-day moving average. SPLK has been glued to the $92 level, no higher than 6% above or below that price. This is a tight range for such a volatile stock and something must give.Earnings will be the catalyst, so investors should watch for similar companies reporting as we approach SPLK earnings in late May.For those looking to buy, here are some levels.21-day Moving Average (MA): $92200-day MA: $91.50Fibonacci support (50%): $87.50 Fibonacci support (61.8%): $82.50The 50-day MA is at $96.50 and will provide resistance until a catalyst can break through it. Upside levels to consider taking profits would be $120-125 and $145-150In Summary While the numbers are not quite there yet, the bulls see some opportunity headed into next quarter and especially next year. The next earnings report will be a major catalyst that will either help the stock well above $100 or take out recent lows.Bulls should be looking to accumulate shares at support levels and watch estimates for any big changes in expectations.Bear of the Day:NIO is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) that designs, develops, manufactures, and sells smart electric vehicles in China.The stock had a big run back in 2020, but NIO has since lost all gains since the EV bull run started. Investors are at a loss as earnings continue to underperform and analysts' lower estimates.About the Company The Shanghai based company was founded in 2014 and is considered the Tesla of China. NIO offers five, six, and seven-seater electric SUVs, as well as smart electric sedans. The company also is also involved in the provision of energy and service packages to its users.NIO is valued at $14.7 Billion and holds Zacks Style Scores of ""F"" in Growth, ""D"" in Value, but ""B"" in Momentum. The stock pays no dividend.Q4 Earnings NIO released Q4 earnings in early March seeing EPS at -$0.44 vs the -$0.16 expected. While sales were up to $2.33B from the $1.55B last year, the EPS miss brought selling into the stock.The big issue was a contraction in margins that came in at 3.9%, down from the 17.2% the year prior. NIO blamed the contraction to accelerated depreciation, and losses on purchase commitments for the existing ES8, ES6 and EC6 amid the transition to new models under the NIO Technology Platform 2.0.EstimatesSince earnings, analysts have been cutting their numbers aggressively for the current year. Over the last 90 days, we have seen numbers fall from -$0.51 top -$1.36.Looking at next year, things don't get much better. 90 days ago, estimates were expected to come in at a gain of 6 cents. But now, a loss of 47 cents is expected.Considering the Tesla earnings report coming up short, investors might want to take extreme caution as we head into NIO earnings.Technical TakeIn early 2020, NIO was just a $3 stock that had a dream. When EV got hot, this dream was realized as the stock ran all the way to $66. From there, the stock became very volatile in 2021 and started to bleed lower in 2022.The collapse continues as the stock recently hit lows not seen since July of 2022.For those interested in moving averages, the 50-day is at $9.40 and the 200-day is at $13.50. These will likely become areas of resistance if the stock manages to rally.SummaryNIO was a former EV highflyer that continues to bleed lower. The estimates are showing no relief coming anytime soon, so investors should shy away from the name.Additional content:Will Abnormal 787 Costs Hurt Boeing (BA) in Q1?The Boeing Company is set to release first-quarter 2023 results on Apr 26, before the opening bell.In the last reported quarter, the company incurred a loss of $1.75 per share, which came in much wider than the Zacks Consensus Estimate of earnings of 5 cents. Solid delivery figures, both commercial and defense, along with robust aftermarket services trend, must have boosted Boeing'sfirst-quarter earnings performance. Yet, abnormal costs associated with 787 might adversely impact its overall first-quarter results.Solid Product Deliveries to Aid ResultsBoeing's first-quarter deliveries reflect a solid 36.8% surge in commercial shipments from the year-ago reported figure. Defense shipments have also increased 2.4% year over year.The jet giant's military and commercial business revenues comprised almost 35% and 39% of its total revenues (as of 2021-end), respectively, thereby together constituting almost 75% of its total revenues.For manufacturing companies like Boeing, successful deliveries of finished products play a crucial role in boosting its revenue growth. Therefore, such a significant improvement witnessed in the jet maker's deliveries for both its commercial and defense segments is expected to benefit Boeing's overall first-quarter results.Expectations for BGSAs far as Boeing Global Services (BGS) unit's first-quarter performance is concerned, we remain optimistic. Notably, a steady growth observed in both domestic and international air travel recently are expected to have bolstered fleet utilization, thereby once again boosting aftermarket commercial jet services in the first quarter of 2023. Meanwhile with 737 Max having returned to China in the fourth quarter of 2022 must have also ushered in some aftermarket services contract for Boeing in the soon to be reported quarter.This, as well as a robust cargo market with several Boeing converted freighter and materials management agreements, is likely to have added an impetus to BGS' first-quarter revenues.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the unit's revenues is pegged at $4,503 million, indicating an improvement of 4.4% from the year-ago reported number.The same for its earnings is pegged at $639 million, indicating growth of 7.9% from the prior-year quarter.Cash Flow ProjectionsHigher jet deliveries, especially that of 737 aircraft, along with the recent strong order activity and increased aftermarket services, are expected to have contributed to Boeing's cash flow reserve.Q1 ExpectationsConsidering the aforementioned discussion, we remain optimistic about BA's overall first-quarter revenue and earnings performance. However, abnormal costs in relation to the 787 program, along with periodic expenses, might adversely impact its bottom-line performance.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Boeing's total revenues is pegged at $17.36 billion, implying a 24.1% improvement from the prior-year reported figure. The bottom line estimate is pinned at a loss of 98 cents per share, indicating a significant improvement from the year-ago quarter's loss of $2.75 per share.What the Zacks Model UnveilsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Boeing this time around. The combination of a positiveEarnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an earnings beat.

It will fund an array of programs and opportunities related to electric transportation, from cars and bicycles to aircraft, as well as their accompanying technologies and infrastructure. Through this support, Georgia Power and the university hope to advance the field of e-mobility and ensure the state of Georgia benefits from that advancement.Story continuesGeorgia Power's gift will be distributed across four areas:Cultivation of an E-Mobility Network: UGA's Engineering E-Mobility Fund broadly supports e-mobility initiatives in teaching, research and outreach. Added support here from Georgia Power will, among other benefits, help expand UGA's Certificate in E-Mobility program; increase access of underrepresented and underserved communities to e-mobility opportunities; and help UGA bring together partners from academia, research, industry and communities across the state of Georgia.E-Mobility Scholarships: The new Georgia Power E-Mobility Scholarship Fund will create scholarships to support students pursuing UGA's Certificate E-mobility.E-Mobility Research: E-mobility research at UGA will be enhanced by the newly established Georgia Power Research Fund in E-Mobility, which may support research on battery technology and design, among other topics.E-Mobility Community Partnerships: To ensure the advances UGA makes are shared with all of Georgia, the Georgia Power E-Mobility Community Partnership Fund will provide resources for UGA to use in exploring strategic partnerships with other academic institutions in the state—from four-year institutions to historically Black colleges and universities to technical colleges—as well as communities and industry groups, with an emphasis on underserved and rural communities.""UGA's position as a flagship university means we are uniquely positioned to capitalize on the significant investments that are occurring in e-mobility in Georgia and transform these investments into benefits for our students and all of our communities,"" said College of Engineering Dean Don Leo. ""My sincere thanks to Georgia Power for their continued partnership.""This is the second gift Georgia Power has made to the university to support e-mobility. In April 2022, the company made a $250,000 gift to create the Georgia Power Electric Mobility Distinguished Professorship, an endowed faculty position in the College of Engineering.Georgia Power's contributions aim to further advance the e-mobility sector in Georgia, which has grown significantly in recent years. The company's economic development team partners with the state to help attract and retain businesses in Georgia every day. According to the Georgia Department of Economic Development, since 2018, 35 electric-vehicle-related projects have committed more than $23 billion in realized or planned investments in Georgia. Among these are high-profile projects from companies like Rivian, Hyundai Motor Group and SK Battery America.UGA also has committed resources to support this growth area for the state. Last year, UGA announced its Electric Mobility Initiative, which provides seed funding for new e-mobility projects and brings together thought leaders to discuss innovative approaches to electric mobility across Georgia and the region. The university will soon launch a faculty hiring initiative to recruit 10 leading researchers in the field of electric mobility to its campus.UGA and Georgia Power officials gathered Friday for the announcement of the Georgia Power gift to the university at the Electric Mobility Summit at the Georgia Center for Continuing Education &amp; Hotel.

171,3975a227-3793-3fa9-afe3-f92414e476d9,SO,2023-04-22,Portland General Electric (POR) Earnings Expected to Grow: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/portland-general-electric-por-earnings-140002415.html,1682085602,STORY,"['POR', 'SO']","[Portland General Electric (POR) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis electric utility is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.75 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +11.9%.Revenues are expected to be $673.5 million, up 7.6% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.06% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Portland General Electric?For Portland General Electric, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +5.33%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Portland General Electric will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Portland General Electric would post earnings of $0.59 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.70, delivering a surprise of +18.64%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Portland General Electric appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Utility - Electric Power industry, Southern Co.

172,f224944a-c8aa-35b8-9775-964c8b31a4fb,SO,2023-04-22,Southern Company (SO) Q1 Earnings on Deck: What to Expect,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/southern-company-q1-earnings-deck-135701133.html,1682085421,STORY,"['SO', 'NJR', 'EIX', 'POR']","[The Southern Company SO is set to release first-quarter results on Apr 27. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 75 cents per share on revenues of $6.7 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the power supplier’s performance in the December quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at Southern Company’s previous-quarter results first.Highlights of Q4 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider beat the consensus mark due to the positive effects of rates, usage and pricing changes, plus a demand boost from favorable weather. Southern Company had reported adjusted earnings per share of 26 cents, ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 24 cents. Moreover, revenues of $7 billion came in 15.6% above the consensus mark.SO topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters and missed in the other. The utility has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 10.2%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:Southern Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company (The) Price and EPS SurpriseSouthern Company (The) price-eps-surprise | Southern Company (The) Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter bottom line has been revised 1.3% downward in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 22.7% decline year over year. However, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues suggests a slight (0.9%) increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderSouthern Company's seven major regulated utilities serve approximately nine million electric and natural gas customers. Leveraging the demographics of its operating territories, the firm has been successfully expanding its regulated business customer base. As proof of that effort, Southern Company added more than 49,000 new residential electric customers and in excess of 31,000 residential natural gas customers in 2022. This trend most likely continued in the January-March period of 2023 because of healthy economic development across its service territories.In particular, the firm is expected to have benefited from higher retail electricity sales, reflecting economic strength in the Southeast in the form of demand from industrial buyers. Finally, investment in state-regulated electric/gas franchises and continued trends in hybrid working have most likely buoyed Southern Company’s revenues and cash flows.On a somewhat bearish note, the power supplier’s total operating cost in the fourth quarter increased 13.3% year over year to $6.9 billion. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the to-be-reported quarter due to inflationary pressures.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Southern Company is likely to beat estimates in the first quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. But that’s not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, for this company is -5.8%.Zacks Rank: Southern Company currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Southern Company, here are some firms from the utilities space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:Portland General Electric Company POR has an Earnings ESP of +5.33% and a Zacks Rank #2.

They created 3D models from Rainer Trummer’s computed tomography scan images by utilizing Oqton D2P software. They used Oqton Geomagic Freeform solution to complete the design of the 55-year-old patient’s occipital prosthesis.Evonik Industries AG’s VESTAKEEP i4 3DF PEEK filament, an implantable high-performance plastic, was used for printing the cranial implant on 3D Systems’ Kumovis R1 extrusion platform. The total process took around 10 hours for getting completed.Rainer Trummer, a computer scientist by profession, has been suffering from craniosynostosis (a birth skull deformity defect). He received the successfully manufactured 3D-printed PEEK cranial implant.3D Systems Corporation Price and Consensus3D Systems Corporation Price and Consensus3D Systems Corporation price-consensus-chart | 3D Systems Corporation Quote3D Systems’ Kumovis R1 is a 3D printing medical device that can make implants by using plastic materials such as poly ether ether ketone, polyphenylsulfone, polyether imide and poly ether ketone ketone while retaining the original mechanical properties. It was specifically designed to enable point-of-care applications within hospitals.

175,88c804a5-398d-34d3-8c18-ac2b6c2246bc,NOC,2023-04-22,3 Aerospace-Defense Stocks to Watch on Bright Jet Deliveries View,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/3-aerospace-defense-stocks-watch-142502440.html,1682087102,STORY,"['NOC', 'GD', 'LMT', '^GSPC']","[Impressive projections for aircraft deliveries in 2023, as stated by the International Air Transport Association (IATA), bode well for aerospace-defense stocks that are engaged in commercial aerospace-related operations. However, pandemic-induced supply-chain disruption in the U.S. defense electronics space remains a threat to the industry players. Nevertheless, the outlook remains bright for the defense side of the aerospace-defense industry, buoyed by a solid budget proposal, which should keep investors interested in this industry. The frontrunners in the aerospace-defense industry are Lockheed Martin LMT, Northrop Grumman NOC and General Dynamics GD.About the IndustryThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry comprises companies that primarily design and manufacture heavy-built products like commercial as well as military jets and helicopters, tankers and other combat vehicles, missiles, combatant ships as well as auxiliary ships, submarines, bombs, guns, space transportation vehicles, military satellites and a few more. The industry also includes cyber security players who offer information technology (IT) services and C4ISR (command, control, communications, computers, intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance) solutions. A portion of revenues comes from defense contractors, offering spare parts, aircraft modification, ship repair and overhaul services and supply chain management services.4 Trends Shaping the Future of the Aerospace-Defense IndustryImproved Air Traffic Outlook Boosts Prospects: Recovering global air traffic data in recent times has boosted the near-term growth prospects of the industry. As stated in a report published by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) in February 2023, industry-wide revenue per kilometer increased 55.5% year over year. IATA projects a solid recovery for aircraft deliveries in 2023, with a total of 1,540 aircraft scheduled to be delivered this year, up 24% from 2022. Such impressive projections bode well for commercial aerospace manufacturers, which have long borne the brunt of poor air travel in the form of delayed jet deliveries and, in some cases, cancellation of their orders altogether by airlines.Expanding Defense Budget Remains a Growth Catalyst: While the commercial aerospace market has been recovering steadily over the past couple of quarters, the defense side of the industry stood its ground amid the COVID-19 crisis, cushioned by steady government support. To this end, it is imperative to mention the U.S. fiscal 2024 defense budget request of $842 billion for the Pentagon, which indicates a 3.2% improvement from fiscal 2023’s enacted amount. Such improved budgetary provisions set the stage for industry players focused on the defense business to win more contracts, which should enhance their top line.Supply Chain Issues May Hurt: Significant supply-chain disruption has been observed in the Aerospace and Defense industry, of late, courtesy of pandemic-induced lower aircraft demand and restrictions on the movement of people and goods. This primarily affected smaller suppliers, like aircraft parts makers, especially those with heavy exposure to commercial aerospace and the aftermarket business. Although the global economy has started to improve, lingering market disequilibria will likely continue to keep prices high, including that of labor, as estimated by IATA. This, in turn, might keep the growth trajectory of the U.S. aerospace and defense industry constricted, to some extent, in the near term.Strengthening Dollar Adds to Industry Woes: The recently appreciating U.S. dollar is adding another layer of cost to airlines’ operations, which are already burdened with high inflation and jet fuel prices. The Federal Reserve’s policy rate now stands at 4.75%, having started 2022 at 0.25%, and will likely peak in 2023 to the vicinity of 5%, as reported by IATA. All U.S. dollar-denominated costs are rising for airlines, which earn revenues in non-U.S. currency. Similarly, the debt burden has increased for all non-dollar-based entities that have borrowed in dollars. Such a burden on airlines might lead to lower aircraft delivery, thereby hurting aerospace-defense industry players that operate in commercial aerospace, in particular.Story continuesZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Aerospace-Defense industry is housed within the broader Zacks Aerospace sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #52, which places it in the top 21% of more than 250 Zacks industries.The group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.Before we present a few aerospace-defense stocks that you may want to add to your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock market performance and valuation picture.Industry Lags S&amp;P 500 &amp; SectorThe Aerospace-Defense industry has underperformed the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite as well as its own sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 5.4% compared with the Aerospace sector’s decline of 3.5%. The Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite has gone down 3.2% in the said timeframe.One-Year Price PerformanceIndustry's Current ValuationOn the basis of the trailing 12-month EV/Sales ratio, which is used for valuing capital-intensive stocks like aerospace-defense, the industry is currently trading at 1.85, compared with the S&amp;P 500’s 3.43 and the sector’s 2.19.Over the past five years, the industry has traded as high as 1.99X, as low as 1.64X, and at the median of 1.88X, as the charts show below.EV-Sales Ratio TTM 3 Aerospace-Defense Stocks to Keep in Your WatchlistLockheed Martin: Based in Bethesda, MD, Lockheed is the largest defense contractor in the world, with its main areas of focus being defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cyber security.

Impressively, China’s GDP grew by 4.5% during the first quarter topping expectations of 4% and rising 2.2% year over year.Furthermore, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank rate China as the world’s largest economy based on purchasing power. As shown in the nearby chart, China’s total GDP in currency is now at $17.73 trillion and just behind the U.S. at $23.32 trillion.The World BankImage Source: The World BankGDP growth is oftentimes indicative of a strong consumer and this makes it more intriguing to invest in Chinese companies at the moment. With that being said, there are quite a few American companies that derive revenue from China and offer an alternative option outside of buying Chinese companies that have American Depository Receipts (ADRs) on U.S. stock exchanges.It is important to note that the market is forward-looking so many stocks offering valuable exposure to China have already soared in recent months but there is still opportunity among the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector in particular.  To that point, China’s retail sales of consumer goods increased 5.8% year over year according to the National Bureau of Statistics. Here are three top-rated Zacks Consumer Discretionary stocks that should have more upside and offer diversification to China’s economy.Trip.com (TCOM)Among ADRs, Trip.com's stock stands out right now and currently boasts a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with its Leisure and Recreation Services Industry in the top 29% of over 250 Zacks industries.As a one-stop travel service company based in Shanghai, Trip.com is expected to be a beneficiary of the warmer summer months ahead as we approach peak travel season. Travel is expected to be higher in 2023 from lingering pent-up demand following the pandemic. This will certainly be the case for destinations in China after reopening its borders.  Story continuesEarnings estimate revisions have noticeably trended higher for Trip.com over the last 60 days. Over the last two months, fiscal 2023 and FY24 EPS estimates have climbed 12% and 11% respectively.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchEven better, Trip.com earnings are now forecasted to skyrocket 275% this year at $1.09 per share compared to EPS of $0.29 in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to soar another 67% to $1.83 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchWynn Resorts (WYNN)Outside of investing in Chinese companies directly through ADRs, Wynn Resorts is a prime example of an American company that should benefit from the growth of China’s economy.Wynn stock sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with the Las Vegas-based company operating its casino resorts in sin city, Everett Massachusetts, and Macau China.In fact, more than 70% of Wynn’s revenue comes from the three casinos it operates in Macau which is considered China’s version of Las Vegas. Indicative of the boost the reopening of the Chinese economy will add to Wynn’s post-pandemic recovery and future growth is that sales are anticipated to climb 45% this year and jump another 17% in FY24 to $6.43 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchChina’s growth is even more crucial to Wynn’s bottom line. To that note, earnings are expected to rebound and climb swing from a loss of -$4.47 per share last year to EPS of $1.05 in 2023. More intriguing, fiscal 2024 earnings are forecasted to leap another 385% at $5.10 a share. Largely attributed to Wynn’s buy rating is that earnings estimate revisions have soared and continue to go up.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchNike (NKE)With an iconic global brand, Nike’s stock will get an added boost from China’s reopening and lands a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Notably, despite Nike’s Greater China segment sales dipping -9% in 2022 at $7.54 billion this still accounted for 16% of its total sales.Even better, this still represented 47% growth over the last five years with 2018 Greater China sales at $5.13 billion. As the Chinese economy kicks back in gear, the footwear and apparel giant will certainly look to continue its expansion in the People’s Republic.                                                       Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThis will certainly add to Nike’s steady growth and earnings power. Nike’s earnings are forecasted to drop -13% this year but rebound and pop 23% in FY24 at $4.00 per share. Plus, earnings estimates have continued to tick higher for FY23 and FY24 over the last 30 days.Nike stock is more appealing considering the company has put together a string of nice earnings beats despite lowered contributions and growth from its Greater China segment. Suprisingly, Nike crushed its fiscal third-quarter earnings expectations by 52% in March with EPS at $0.79 compared to estimates of $0.27 a share.  Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayThese Zacks Consumer Discretionary stocks offer unique diversification to China’s huge economy. Furthermore, China’s strong first-quarter GDP numbers are a positive affirmation that these companies are growing as well. The rising earnings estimate revisions appear to reaffirm this and could continue to trend higher leading to nice upside in Trip.com, Wynn Resorts, and Nike stock.  Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

They're particularly keen for signals from the regional banks most vulnerable to the panic that cascaded through the financial system in the weeks that followed.Reports over the past week from more than 15 regional lenders offered plenty of those signs, as multiple executives said the deposit outflows they saw in March had since stabilized or even reversed.Horizon Investments head of portfolio strategy Zach Hill called the earnings results this past week ""better than feared.""The banking crisis ""does feel like it's largely contained,"" added Quant Insight head of analytics Huw Roberts.Wedbush analyst David Chiaverini told Yahoo Finance the theme dominating this earnings season so far is ""less than feared.""At Western Alliance, deposits rose by $2 billion in the first two weeks of April.""The waters are now calmer,"" Western Alliance CEO Ken Vecchione told analysts this week.This doesn’t mean, however, that all is fine for the many mid-sized banks that lack the power or diversity of industry giants such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC).Many of these smaller institutions said they now expect to earn less on their loans and pay more for their deposits, thus lowering expectations of revenue and profits in the future. Some also said they expect stricter federal banking regulations that could force them to raise more capital.On Friday Moody's reinforced this challenging outlook by downgrading ratings for 11 regional lenders, including a two-notch cut for Western Alliance, citing ""a deterioration in the operating environment and funding conditions for US banks.""Story continues""Some of the immediate problems have gone away but the reality is with interest rates higher the banks’ business model is going to have to change, and that’s going to play out over months and quarters and even years,"" Commonwealth Financial Network CIO Brad McMillan told Yahoo Finance.Higher costs, lower profitsTheir problems start with a critical source of funding for smaller institutions: deposits. Even before the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, bank customers who were earning little interest from their accounts had begun moving their money to higher-yielding alternatives such as certificates of deposit or money market funds.That outflow accelerated in March. Comerica (CMA), a regional bank in Dallas, said its deposits fell 9% during the first three months of the year. Zions (ZION), a Salt Lake City lender, said they dropped 3.4%.That forced many regional lenders to start paying more to keep depositors or attract them back. Deposit costs for Comerica rose 2,850% from a year ago, to $118 million. At Zions, these costs were up 1,266%, to $82 million. At Cincinnati lender Fifth Third (FITB) and Cleveland lender KeyCorp (KEY), the increases were 4,245% and 2,400%, respectively. Comerica and Zions were among the banks that received downgrades from Moody's on Friday.A Comerica bank branch. Credit: BauerGriffin/MediaPunch /IPX (AaronP/MediaPunch/IPx)Those higher costs, in turn, are beginning to cut into a key measure of profitability known as net interest income, which is the difference between what a bank earns on its loans and pays out on its deposits. Many regional banks said their net interest income dropped from the fourth quarter of 2022 and they expect it to drop again in the second quarter of this year as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates high.KeyCorp and Fifth Third were among the banks that reduced their net interest income expectations. Comerica said it expects that number to drop 11-13% in the three months ending June 30.But Comerica executives also said they expect some of the deposits they lost to come back. Much of the outflows in March, they said, happened because long standing customers decided to move some excess amounts elsewhere. Because those relationships are strong, customers may return.""I don’t think we are going to have to pay up for it,"" senior executive vice president Peter Sefzik told analysts Thursday.'No crisis inside our four walls'Several executives from regional banks said some concerns about their corner of the industry were overhyped. After all, recent data shows that deposit outflows among banks below $250 billion in assets have slowed since March. These institutions even regained $20 billion in the two weeks ending April 12, according to Fed data released Friday.Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence told analysts Thursday his institution is particularly well situated to benefit from a recent surge in manufacturing jobs across his regions in the Midwest.""Markets have been trading on narratives over fundamentals,"" he said, adding that ""there was no crisis inside our four walls.""Western Alliance's CEO, Vecchione, admitted that depositors withdrew $8 billion from his bank in one day during March but said deposits began returning within a week. After gaining back $2 billion during the first two weeks of April it expects to pull in another $2 billion per quarter this year.""We've returned to a lot more calm,"" Vecchione said.Some of that new industry calm could get tested again next week as more regional banks report results. Plenty of investors will be paying close attention to one specific name that was at the center of last month’s crisis, First Republic (FRC), which is scheduled to release first-quarter earnings Monday. In March the San Francisco lender took a $30 billion deposit infusion from 11 rival banks in a bid to restore confidence. It was also among the banks that received downgrades from Moody's on Friday, specifically on its preferred-stock rating.A lot of money is riding on its fate. Everyday investors have bet $245 million on First Republic stock since the fall of Silicon Valley Bank, according to Vanda Research, the third highest inflow to a specific bank stock behind Bank of America and Charles Schwab (SCHW). It also has one of the highest levels of interest among so-called short sellers betting on the stock to decline, according to analytics firm S3 Partners, accounting for $480 million in such bets over the last 30 days.First Republic ""will be a bellwether of sentiment for the sector"" Vanda said in a note this past week.Western Alliance’s CEO told analysts Wednesday that his bank had proved it was now in a different category than First Republic.""There was a point where whatever happened to them affected us. But I think we've now separated ourselves.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of the pharmaceutical sector and its outlook this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2023. The pharmaceutical industry in the US is one of the largest in the world, representing roughly 50% of the global pharmaceutical sales revenue, as of 2020. The industry consists of a wide range of players, including large multinational corporations, mid-sized and small companies, and biotech startups. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry, as some companies dealing in vaccines or treatments for the virus experienced increased demand for their products. The trend of spending on Covid-related drugs continued through 2022. Some of the biggest pharma companies, like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), among others, are estimated to have generated approximately $100 billion in revenues in 2022, according to a report by Reuters.The current inflationary period has brought defensive stocks into the limelight as these stocks do not get affected by economic cycles. Pharmaceutical companies are often considered to be defensive as they deal in products that are considered essential for the maintenance of health and the treatment of illnesses, and demand for these products may remain relatively stable even during a recession. The sector also delivered positive returns to shareholders last year, when the S&amp;P 500 recorded its worst annual performance since 2008. The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index gained 4.91% from December 2021 to December 2022, compared with a 19.4% decline in the S&amp;P 500 during the same period. The index returned 3.71% in the past 12 months.Though pharma stocks delivered solid returns in 2022, the sector had a comparatively slow year pertaining to merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) deals compared with the previous years. One of the main reasons for this slowdown was that drugmakers acquired companies with authorized and tested drugs and products, instead of companies with products in clinical trials. Moreover, the economic headwinds from inflation and higher interest rates also hindered the deals last year. The deal value in the biopharma sector fell 42% in 2022, compared with 2021, as reported by Ernst &amp; Young. It was not the case in the past as large-cap pharma companies closed 178 deals from 2016 to 2020 with a total value of over $452.3 billion. However, analysts are positive about the activity gaining momentum this year. PwC expects the total M&amp;A deals to value between $225 billion and $275 billion across all sectors in 2023.

We are simply betting that the future might not be as bad as the price suggests.”Consensus FY22 and FY23 EPS estimates at the time were around $17 – $18 per share.

The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo. At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”6. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70 CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare company that owns a range of retail pharmacy chains.

Vltava Fund mentioned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years. We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt. This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2023. Suggested articles:10 Best FAANG Stocks To Buy Now10 Best Telecom Dividend Stocks To Buy for 202310 Undervalued Lithium Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

(Blue Whale) (Burlington, VT). The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable.The ratings reflect Blue Whale’s balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its strong operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).The ratings also reflect Blue Whale’s strategic position as the only captive insurer for Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer) [NYSE: PFE], a leading global pharmaceutical company. As Blue Whale insures or reinsures Pfizer’s global property exposures, it plays an important role in Pfizer’s overall ERM and assumes a critical role in protecting the Pfizer enterprise’s assets.Blue Whale provides coverages with significant limits and elevated potential gross exposures per loss occurrence. Its net property retentions remain quite substantial. Nonetheless, the reinsurance program is appropriate and diverse, providing ample coverage for all of its lines of business. AM Best recognizes the quality of the reinsurers and the substantial financial resources and support available to the captive as part of Pfizer. Blue Whale’s historical and prospective operating performance are strong with low average loss and minimal expense ratios. However, volatility of key metrics can be low to moderate with its high retentions for low frequency, high severity coverage.Blue Whale is a wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary of Pfizer, created to insure or reinsure specific risks of the parent organization. In recent years of hard market conditions, Blue Whale has opted to participate in small slices of its CAT tower as an economic efficiency for the Pfizer enterprise. It also offers capacity for cyber liability coverage when required by hard market pricing.Negative rating action could occur if AM Best's perception wanes of Pfizer’s ability and/or willingness to support the captive.Story continuesAM Best remains the leading rating agency of alternative risk transfer entities, with more than 200 such vehicles rated in the United States and throughout the world.

185,46247350-d39f-3fe0-8f6d-e581593af4e7,FOXA,2023-04-22,Column: We've solved the mystery of Smartmatic’s funding in $2.7 bln Fox case,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-weve-solved-mystery-smartmatic-202055303.html,1682108455,STORY,['FOXA'],"[By Alison Frankel(Reuters) - (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) The voting technology company Smartmatic USA Corp is up against a phalanx of Fox lawyers in its $2.7 billion defamation suit over debunked election fraud claims.Fox News Network LLC and Fox Corp are shelling out for the services of at least three law firms, including top appellate counsel from Clement &amp; Murphy and a vast team from Kirkland &amp; Ellis, one of the biggest and most expensive law firms in the country.How is Smartmatic — the David to Fox's Goliath in this case — coming up with the money to litigate against Fox’s high-priced onslaught?Fox has long suspected that Smartmatic was receiving funding from an outside source. Its lawyers have repeatedly argued in filings to New York State Supreme Court Justice David Cohen that Smartmatic has no money to spare, citing a report from its expert economist that the voting tech company lost $100 million between 2016 and 2020 and hasn’t turned a profit in years. (Smartmatic refutes that contention, insisting that Fox’s false reporting squelched its billion-dollar prospects.)Fox litigated for more than a year to find out who is funding Smartmatic’s case, arguing that the funder’s motives were relevant to its counterclaim accusing the election tech company of filing a baseless lawsuit. As I’ll explain, Fox won that fight: Cohen ruled last month that Smartmatic has to disclose any agreement to pay its litigation costs and expenses.But it turns out that Fox was apparently wrong all along about Smartmatic’s funding: No outsider is paying Smartmatic’s litigation costs, according to Smartmatic counsel Erik Connolly of Benesch, Friedlander, Coplan &amp; Aronoff.“Smartmatic does not have any third-party funding for the cases, and never has had such funding,” Connolly said in an email statement to me.He and a Smartmatic spokesperson did not respond to my follow-up question about whether Benesch Friedlander is handling the case on a contingency fee basis, in which the law firm fronts the cost of litigation in exchange for a percentage of the client’s ultimate recovery. As my Reuters colleague Andrew Goudsward reported earlier this week, Dominion’s lead counsel in its parallel defamation suit against Fox, Susman Godfrey, handled Dominion’s case on a discounted contingency fee basis, which means the law firm should have quite a payday thanks to Dominion’s $787.5 million settlement with Fox.Story continuesI’m not sure why Smartmatic fought so hard against Fox’s demand for disclosure of a funding agreement that, according to the company’s new statement to me, does not even exist. But I’m sure Smartmatic and its lawyers had a bit of a laugh along the way at what now seems to have been a wild goose chase by Fox.Spokespeople for Fox News and Fox Corp did not respond to my email query about Smartmatic’s denial of outside funding or to a previous query about what Smartmatic disclosed to Fox after Cohen ordered the voting tech company to disclose funding agreements.New York state courts generally frown on demands for the disclosure of litigation funding agreements. As Smartmatic argued in a Feb. 24 brief asking Cohen to overrule a hearing judge’s order that it turn over any funding documents to Fox, defendants are only entitled to see such agreements if they can show outside funding is directly relevant to claims or defenses in the case. Smartmatic said that Fox’s purported justification – that the identity of any funder would shed light on Smartmatic’s motives for suing Fox – was not sufficient because Fox was merely speculating.Smartmatic was a bit cagey in its brief, arguing vehemently against the disclosure of any litigation funding agreement without saying whether the company had actually entered into any such agreement. “To the extent that they exist,” it argued, “Smartmatic should not have to produce these agreements.”Fox responded that any litigation funding agreement was directly relevant to its counterclaim under New York’s so-called anti-SLAPP law, which was enacted to discourage meritless litigation designed to chill public debate. Fox argued that Smartmatic’s “deeply implausible” demand for nearly $3 billion in damages was the “very definition of trying to chill speech.”According to Fox, the disclosure of Smartmatic’s backers would show “whether Smartmatic’s aggressive claims are being driven by other individuals or entities who have a proverbial axe to grind.”Cohen sided with Fox in his March 24 ruling, holding that the identity of any Smartmatic funder could be relevant to Fox's arguments about Smartmatic's improper motives for suing.Given the judge's ruling, I was eager to read the counterclaims Fox filed this week to find out what it had learned about Smartmatic’s funding. Would Fox assert that some liberal activist was backing Smartmatic's big-money defamation suit in the hopes of tarring the network? Such a scenario would resemble assertions by former President Donald Trump, who claimed in a court filing earlier this month that a prominent Democratic donor is funding a defamation suit over his denial of rape claims by New York writer E. Jean Carroll.Or maybe Fox would allege that Smartmatic was being bankrolled by a competitor on Fox’s right flank. Even the Fox filing revealed only that the voting tech company had made a deal with a traditional litigation financier, I figured it would be interesting to know which funder had a stake in Smartmatic’s case.But to my surprise, Fox’s filing was silent on the matter of litigation funding. Its counterclaim, demanding that Smartmatic pay Fox’s fees and costs for defending a baseless lawsuit, simply re-iterated Fox’s arguments that Smartmatic could not possibly have suffered billions of dollars of harm from the network's reporting of newsworthy allegations of election fraud by Trump and his allies.So far, those arguments have not succeeded in ending the Smartmatic suit. Cohen denied Fox’s dismissal motion last March. An intermediate state appellate court affirmed that ruling in February, despite Fox arguments that it was entitled to immunity for reporting on newsworthy allegations.I'm sure Fox was hoping to cast additional doubt on Smartmatic’s motives by ascribing ill intentions to a litigation funder. But it looks like that's a dead end.Read more:Fox resolves Dominion case, but $2.7 billion Smartmatic lawsuit loomsNo delay for Trump in rape accuser's trial, more discovery allowedFox News must face Smartmatic's lawsuit over election-rigging claims(Reporting By Alison Frankel; editing by Leigh Jones)]"

According to a recent QuickBooks survey, 65% of respondents who plan to start a new business in 2023 said they'd continue their day job, and 66% said they wanted to start a business to boost their income amid inflation.More from Fortune:  5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from home Looking to make extra cash? This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home “Today’s economic environment is anything but stable. Having a side hustle not only helps to pad your bank account and bolster financial security, but brings along psychological benefits,” says Christina Curtis, founder of Curtis Leadership Consulting, an executive coaching firm in Denver. “Having more income for that rainy day brings about a stronger sense of courage and willingness to take calculated risks that can advance your career.”However, you don’t need to invest in launching a major business to reap the benefits of extra side income. Leveraging technology to take on small jobs and tasks can help you earn extra cash quickly.How to make money fastConsider these options if you’re looking for ways to make more money that don’t require a large startup investment or specialized skills—and result in quick cash.1. Become a rideshare driverIf you have your own car and it meets certain qualifications, you could join the ranks of rideshare drivers and make money for giving customers rides around town. It only takes a few days to get approved to drive, in most cases. And both Uber and Lyft pay every week, though getting paid even faster for a small fee is possible.As far as how much you can make, it depends a lot on where you’re located, the trip fare, any promotions taking place, and whether your riders add a tip. According to The Rideshare Guy, most Uber drivers will make around $15 to $20 per hour.Story continues2. Make deliveriesIf you want to earn money driving but aren’t interested in making awkward car conversations, you can make deliveries instead. Apps such as DoorDash, UberEats, Grubhub, and Instacart focus on delivering fast food, groceries, and other items, with a similar sign-up and payment process as ridesharing.Shipt is another app that pays you to do shopping and/or pick up and drop off packages to customers’ homes. Workers earn an average of $25 to $35 per hour and are guaranteed at least $16 per hour. You can get paid weekly or daily.3. Help others with simple, everyday tasksFor those who are particularly handy, offering your services to people who need tasks done around the house is another way to make money fast. You can rely on word of mouth, or sign up on a platform like TaskRabbit, which connects Taskers with customers who need help putting together Ikea furniture, mounting TVs, cleaning, and more. Plus, you can set your own rates and keep 100% of your earnings, including tips (a small registration fee may be required to get started). Most people are approved to start tasking within four business days.4. Pet sitHouse and pet sitting can be a good way to make money fast, especially if you enjoy spending time with animals and have a flexible schedule. Again, you can rely on referrals and word of mouth to find paying customers, though it may take time to build up a network.To speed up the process, you can sign up for an app such as Rover, which allows you to set your rates and select the type of pet care services you offer (such as walks, overnight stays, etc.) and then connect with customers and get paid through the platform. Payments show up in your account two days after completing a service. Additional tips are available after 24 hours.5. Sell clothes and accessories onlineWant to make money fast and clear out some closet space? Multiple online consignment stores allow you to sell clothes, shoes, handbags, and more.Poshmark, for instance, lets you set up an online closet where you showcase items for sale. Brand names and well-designed posts featuring high-quality pictures, detailed descriptions, and competitive prices will likely sell faster. Once a sold item reaches its destination, funds are released to your account within three days.Similar services include Mercari, ThredUp, Depop, and The RealReal. But you don’t have to stick with consignment stores; services such as Facebook Marketplace and Craigslist also allow you to sell your belongings without a middleman, though it may take more time to vet buyers, and you may receive more lowball offers.6. Sell unused gift cardsA 2022 study by CreditCards.com found that 47% of Americans have at least one unused gift card. So if you have gift cards from holidays past collecting dust, consider selling them online at a discount for cash.Raise is an online marketplace where you can list your gift cards for partial value and users can buy them. Once a sale is made, a 15% fee is deducted and funds are directly deposited to your PayPal or bank account. If you don’t want the burden of finding buyers, a site like CardCash will pay you upfront for your gift cards (up to 92% of their value) and resell them.7. Earn a bank bonusIf you’re looking for a one-off opportunity to earn extra money, consider opening a checking or savings account that offers a new customer bonus. It takes little effort, and can result in an extra $200 or $300 in the bank. Remember that to qualify for a bonus, you may be required to make a minimum initial deposit or keep the account open for a minimum period.8. Take surveysWhen you have extra time, you can make a few bucks an hour by filling out surveys, quizzes, watching videos, and more through sites such as ​​Survey Junkie, Swagbucks, Inbox Dollars, and Google Opinion Rewards.Survey Junkie, for instance, lets you earn virtual points for answering surveys about products or participating in focus groups. Those points can then be redeemed for cash. The company notes that you won’t get rich or replace your full-time job, but it is an opportunity to share your opinions for a little extra cash. You can earn as much as $40 per month by completing three surveys daily.9. Trade in old electronicsThere’s a good chance you have an old smartphone or tablet sitting in a drawer somewhere, no longer being used. To make money fast, consider selling it to a buyback service such as ItsWorthMore, Decluttr, Gazelle, or Trademore, where you can trade in old phones, laptops, tablets, smartwatches, and more. The amount you get paid depends on the exact model of the item and its condition.Gazelle notes that once it receives your item, the transaction is processed in a day or two, and as long as the model and condition are confirmed during the inspection, the payment is processed within three to five business days. Amazon and PayPal are the fastest ways to get paid. Similarly, Trademore pays out within five business days of receiving and confirming the item, via PayPal or a virtual Mastercard gift card.10. Host a yard saleA yard sale is a great way to declutter your home and make money same-day, in cash, by selling unwanted belongings to neighbors. Sites such as YardSaleSearch.com, GarageSaleFinder.com, and eBay Classifieds can help you get the word out.To ensure a successful sale, put items out in an organized fashion. Start early on a Thursday or Friday, around 6:00 a.m., to catch the crowd of people dropping their kids off at school. And don’t put a price on anything—you’ll save yourself some headache by letting customers come to you with their best offers.11. Rent a parking spaceIf you live near a major attraction, such as an amusement park or stadium—or there’s a major event happening near your home, like a parade—you can make quick money by renting out your parking space for the day. Maybe you don’t have a car, and that precious parking real estate could generate daily cash.If you aren’t sure how to find a tenant, consider a service such as CurbFlip or SpotHero, which let you rent out your driveway, parking space, or garage. These sites take a fee but also vet drivers, allowing you to manage payments within the platform. Just be sure that you aren’t violating any lease or homeowners association agreement terms if you list your parking spot.12. Rent out your car or RVAfter plummeting during the pandemic, the cost of renting a vehicle has skyrocketed over the past couple of years. Global car rental prices are predicted to rise another 6.8% in 2023, according to forecasts by CWT. In turn, affordable car-sharing services are gaining popularity.If you don’t mind strangers driving your vehicle, you can rent it when you’re not using it. Turo, for example, allows you to rent your car and even offers a calculator to see how much you could earn based on your vehicle. After your first completed trip, payment is made within three business days. Subsequent trips pay out three hours after the trip ends.Recreational vehicles have also been incredibly popular since the pandemic. Outdoorsy is a similar service that lets you rent your RV to travelers. Payments are automatically deposited to your bank account 48 hours after a guest begins their trip. However, it can take your bank another three to five days to process the payment.13. Find out if you have unclaimed propertyIt might sound like a scam, but there is a real possibility that you have unclaimed property being held by the government, such as an old bank account, insurance policy, dividend check, etc. Finding it is one way to make money fast. Each state has its own database of unclaimed property; to find out if you have money waiting to be claimed, check the National Association of Unclaimed Property Administrators' directory.14. Test out websites and appsYou don’t have to be a tech expert to get paid for user testing. As long as you have a device with a working microphone and a PayPal account, you can make money for visiting websites, apps, or digital products, completing a set of tasks, and sharing your thoughts.One site that facilitates paid user testing is Usertesting.com. After completing a 15- to 20-minute practice test, you’ll find out if you’re accepted in a few days. The amount you can earn depends on the test type, but you’ll always see the pay range in your dashboard. Payments are sent to your PayPal account after seven days. Sometimes, customers may send you a bonus for completing longer or more complex projects.15. Do laundryNot everyone has the luxury of a washer and dryer in their home, or the time to do laundry for a busy family. Maybe you do. If so, you can make money by doing laundry for others.Laundry Care is an example of an app-based wash-and-fold service that lets you do laundry from home and pick up and drop off orders for customers. The typical order is two bags, averaging 15 pounds each. You get paid $20 per bag, plus a service fee of $3. You can also perform other services, such as ironing, which is an additional per-item payment. Customers can also tip you, and you keep 100% of that amount. Payments can be cashed out at any time and deposited into your bank account in one to three business days.16. Put ads on your carAnother way to make money with your car is by allowing companies like Wrapify, Carvertise, and Nickelytics to put their ads on it. These services will pay you each month during a campaign for adding a decal, sticker, or wrap to your car that promotes a product or service.Wrapify, for example, pays around $180 to $452 monthly, depending on the coverage level. Carvertise says it pays $450 to $1,500 per campaign. And Nickelytics says most of its drivers earn between $175 and $250 per month, though some campaigns may pay up to $500. All these services pay out monthly.The takeawayStarting a side hustle might sound daunting, but it doesn’t have to be. Plenty of ways to make money fast don’t require much time, investment, or equipment. It’s up to you how much time you want to dedicate to earning a side income, whether 10 hours a week or 10 minutes once.Just be sure that however you choose to make money, you put those funds to good use. Earning side income is a great way to pad your emergency fund, pay off debt, or start investing.This story was originally featured on Fortune.comMore from Fortune: 5 side hustles where you may earn over $20,000 per year—all while working from homeLooking to make extra cash?

192,a63afefc-508b-3e0c-8ca2-92e73dc686b7,IBM,2023-04-22,Top 15 Cloud Computing Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-15-cloud-computing-companies-202451124.html,1682108691,STORY,"['AMZN', 'CRM', 'DBX', 'NVDA', 'WDAY', 'IOT', 'IBM', 'NOW', 'SPLK', 'ADSK', 'VMW', 'VEEV', 'ADP', 'TEAM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the top 15 cloud computing companies in the world. For more companies head on over to Top 5 Cloud Computing Companies in the World. The growth of technology has created new markets and changed the manner in which people live their lives and businesses run their operations. While the computer and the microprocessor on their own have enabled users to compute billions of instructions in the blink of an eye, the true disruption from technology takes place in tandem with the rise of the Internet. Data from the popular internet speed testing firm Ookla, global internet speeds have grown from 0.5 megabits per second (Mbps) to 107 Mbps as of July 2021.This high speed connectivity has generated growth in a relatively nascent industry called cloud computing. The Internet's role in cloud computing growth is clear from the fact that these technologies have been present since the 1970s when computers were first linked together to allow for resource sharing. This also led to a growth in enterprise resource computing and firms such as SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) which enable companies to manage their production and other resources efficiently. However, things only took a head at the turn of the millennia, with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) allowing its customers to 'rent out' cloud computing resources and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) delivering software over the Internet. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) joined in soon as it provided a system for developers to develop applications over the Internet, and even the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) pitched in by providing the world's first open source software for creating private and semi private cloud computing networks.These days, cloud computing is used far and wide in both the enterprise sector and by the general consumer. One of the most well known examples of cloud computing is Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX)'s online platform that enables users to remotely share their documents and other resources. While on the surface Dropbox being a cloud computing firm might sound counterintuitive due to the term 'computing', in fact, cloud computing is defined by three distinct yet interrelated services. These are platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). Out of these, Dropbox is a SaaS company since it provides people with access to a virtual platform located on its hardware through an easily accessible interface.Story continuesOn the corporate side of things, cloud computing is quite prevalent as well. These uses are spread across a variety of industries, from sectors ranging from hospitality and restaurants to biotechnology, banking, and production and logistics optimization. According to the consulting firm McKinsey, the coronavirus pandemic was a massive stimulant for the cloud computing sector. It outlines that prior to the devastating global pandemic, companies planned to spend less than half of their information technology budgets on cloud computing by 2021. However, the pandemic led to this spending growing to 80% of the budget by 2024. A large motivating factor behind this spending is the cost benefits offered by cloud computing, as according to McKinsey, the segment can generate an additional $1 trillion in operating income. For the uninitiated, operating income is the income of a firm after direct and indirect costs are accounted for but taxes and interest payments are not subtracted. On a side note, cloud computing was also central in Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s fight against the coronavirus, as the firm built its messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) research platform on a public cloud, which enabled it to scale up research of, and rapidly design, the Spikevax coronavirus vaccine.As a whole, the global cloud computing market was worth $484 billion in 2022 and should grow to $619 billion by the end of this year according to a report from Grand View Research. From then until 2030, the sector is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1% and sit at a final value of $1.5 trillion by the end of the forecast period.Looking at the situation on the ground, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s chief financial officer Mr. Brian Olsavsky commented on the firm's AWS cloud computing division during Amazon's Q4 2022 earnings call conference where he highlighted:Net sales increased $21.4 billion in Q4, up 20% year-over-year and now representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Starting back in the middle of the third quarter of 2022, we saw our year-over-year growth rates slow as enterprises of all sizes evaluated ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to the tough macroeconomic conditions.As expected, these optimization efforts continued into the fourth quarter. Some of the key benefits of being in the cloud compared to managing your own data center are the ability to handle large demand swings and to optimize costs relatively quickly, especially during times of economic uncertainty. Our customers are looking for ways to save money, and we spend a lot of our time trying to help them do so. This customer focus is in our DNA and informs how we think about our customer relationships and how we will partner with them for the long term. As we look ahead, we expect these optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters. So far in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-teens.That said, stepping back, our new customer pipeline remains healthy and robust, and there are many customers continuing to put plans in place to migrate to the cloud and commit to AWS over the long term.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the top cloud computing companies in the world, with the top ones being Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL).Top 15 Cloud Computing Companies in the WorldAI Generated ImageOur Methodology To find the top cloud computing companies in the world, we started by listing down all publicly traded firms that provide cloud computing products and services.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Dalio’s investment philosophy and portfolio construction, go directly to the Top 5 Technology Stocks to Buy in 2023, According to Ray Dalio.Billionaire Ray Dalio argued in a recent interview on the Julia La Roche Show that global central banks are less willing to hold the US dollar for two reasons. First, the greenback has serious competition for the first time in many decades from the Chinese yuan. He noted that China's share of global trade is ascendant while the US share is shrinking. Most importantly, China is promoting trading agreements centered on its currency rather than the dollar, which has been the norm for a long time. Secondly, Western sanctions against Russia and several other countries have exposed new risks for holding dollar-denominated assets. For instance, the US and its allies froze Russia's assets, with the US Fed freezing currency reserves. To Dalio, the action was not only high-handed but spooky to global central banks that hold dollar-denominated currency reserves.Last year, Dalio said during CNBC's Squawk Box interview that investors are better off not keeping cash because inflation had reached dangerous levels. Instead, he argued that putting the money in a well-balanced portfolio was safe. He also spent time discussing his latest book, ""The Changing World Order,"" in which he shares valuable insights on the current geopolitical and economic cycles.Dalio has made bullish comments on China's tech sector, arguing that it is vibrant and poised to challenge the United States. At home, Dalio was among the loudest speakers regarding the possibility of a tech stock bubble pre-2021. He said in an interview in early 2022 that the Fed's rate hikes would hit hard the 'bubble-type' tech stocks. His thoughts were prescient because several tech stocks lost significant value in 2022 after the Fed's sustained campaign of rate hikes.Story continuesTop 10 Technology Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Ray DalioRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur MethodologyWe picked top 10 tech stocks from Bridgewater Associates' 13F portfolio as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. Although the billionaire retired from Bridgewater, he remains a mentor, board member and investor at the firm.Top Technology Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Ray Dalio10. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $24.89 million Percentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 0.13% Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 117Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) provides streaming entertainment services, including TV series, movies, documentaries, and mobile games in multiple languages and genres, available on various internet-connected devices. The company has around 231 million paid subscribers across 190 countries.On April 18, Credit Suisse analyst Douglas Mitchelson raised his price objective on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) to $331 from $291 and retained a ‘Neutral’ rating before Q1 earnings report. Credit Suisse predicted positive investor feedback on Netflix's Q1 earnings with increased revenue and margin improvement but anticipated management's caution on Q2 subscriber numbers due to potential password-sharing launches and seasonal effects.Bridgewater Associates owns 84,422 shares in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), valued at more than $24.89 million, which accounts for 0.13% of the hedge fund's portfolio. The hedge fund has boosted its stake in the firm by an impressive 101% in the fourth quarter of 2022.Out of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 117 hedge funds were long Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) during the fourth quarter with aggregate stakes worth $8.15 billion. This compares to 115 hedge funds holding $6.66 billion in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in the previous quarter.Like Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the tech stocks on the radar of Ray Dalio.In its Q4 2022 investor letter, Broyhill Asset Management stated the following about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX):“Speaking of fresh names, we established a new position in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) during the second half. We began accumulating shares after the company reported two consecutive quarters of subscriber losses, which brought the stock down by about 75% from peak to trough. Our investment in Netflix is a good example of what we categorize as a “temporary dislocation” and a great example of the historical investments we’ve made in the tech sector. Unlike other “value” investors, we don’t arbitrarily put tech in the “too hard” pile. We are comfortable and more than happy to underwrite investments in the industry. We just demand a margin of safety when doing it (something often ignored by other investors in the industry). That margin of safety opened up when consensus quickly concluded that Netflix’s growth was over, on the heels of two quarters of subscriber losses, which happened to follow years of surging lock-down-induced demand. The popular narrative was that by pursuing advertising revenue, Netflix was all but admitting that streaming television was completely saturated. We thought otherwise. With ~ 75MM subscribers in the US, even converting a small portion of those 100MM moochers would move the needle3. And given the superiority of the company’s technology and first-party user data, we think the consensus is completely underestimating the long-term potential of a Netflix advertising model.”9. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $28.67 million Percentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 0.15% Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 43International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) provides integrated solutions and services globally, operating through four business segments: Software, Consulting, Infrastructure, and Financing, offering hybrid cloud platform and software solutions, business transformation and technology consulting services, server and storage solutions, and financing services.Securities filings reveal that Bridgewater Associates boosted its stake in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) by 8% during the fourth quarter of 2022.

The most prominent shareholder in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is Adage Capital Management, with 919,590 shares valued at $129.56 million.In its Q4 2022 investor letter, Diamond Hill Capital stated the following about International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM):“New positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and elf Beauty (ELF). Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”8.

NOV is set to release first-quarter results on Apr 26. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 22 cents per share on revenues of $2 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the oilfield service provider’s performance in the March quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at NOV’s previous-quarter results first.Highlights of Q4 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the Houston, TX-based oil and gas equipment company beat the consensus mark on an improving momentum in the international markets. NOV had reported net income per share of 26 cents, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents. Revenues of $2.1 billion also came in 6.5% above the consensus mark.NOV beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings twice in the last four quarters and missed in the other two, resulting in an earnings surprise of 27.4%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:NOV Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNOV Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNOV Inc. price-eps-surprise | NOV Inc. Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 269.2% jump year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 26.4% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderOne of NOV’s key segments — Rig Technologies — is expected to have benefited from impressive sales of offshore wind turbine installation vessel packages and growing demand for its aftermarket operations during the first quarter of 2023. As a result of this improved operating environment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter revenues of Rig Technologies is pegged at $534 million, indicating an increase of 21.1% from the year-ago period.NOV is also expected to have benefited from a powerful performance from its Wellbore Technologies unit, with more drilling work, improved pricing and better execution. As a reflection of this, the consensus mark for first-quarter Wellbore Technologies revenues stands at $764 million, suggesting a rise of 25.7% from the corresponding period of 2022.On a somewhat bearish note, the increase in NOV’s costs might have dented the company’s to-be-reported bottom line. The company’s fourth-quarter cost of goods sold totaled $1.6 billion, up 24% from the year-ago period. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the first quarter due to the prevailing inflationary environment.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that NOV is likely to beat estimates in the first quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates.

197,df81a64b-8e84-3f35-85d7-011bd24dfff2,MPC,2023-04-22,Imperial (IMO) to Finish Oil Sands Wastewater Cleanup by May,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/imperial-imo-finish-oil-sands-105610593.html,1682074570,STORY,"['IMO.TO', 'RNGR', 'MPC', 'PARR']","[Imperial Oil IMO has announced that it will complete the cleanup process of its oil sands wastewater by the end of May. This is a significant step toward reducing its operational impact on the surrounding ecosystem and improving environmental sustainability.The company was in the news regarding its cleanup efforts following two incidents at the Kearl oil sands site. The first incident involved a wastewater overflow from a containment pond in February, and the second was the tailings pond seepage, discovered in May 2022. Water tests conducted after these incidents confirmed the presence of toxic elements in the local groundwater and at least one nearby water body.Overview of the Cleanup Process:The cleaning process requires the removal of contaminants from the wastewater that were produced during oil sands extraction. This is done using a combination of physical, chemical and biological treatments.The physical treatment involves removing solid and suspended particles from the water, which is done through settling and filtration procedures. The chemical treatment makes use of chemicals to break down and remove contaminants, such as organic compounds and heavy metals. The biological treatment involves using microorganisms to consume and break down organic matter.Imperial has implemented a multi-stage treatment process that combines all these methods to effectively clean its wastewater. The process entails the usage of settling tanks, filters and bioreactors to remove contaminants and improve water quality.According to an announcement made by an Imperial executive, the company has completed the cleanup of the wastewater overflow. It has also made significant progress in the remediation of the tailings pond seepage.Environmental Impact:The cleanup of oil sands wastewater is a critical issue for companies operating in the oil and gas industry. Contaminated wastewater can have significant negative impact on the environment, including nearby water sources and wildlife.Story continuesImperial has taken significant steps toward reducing its environmental impact. These include investing in technologies to reduce emissions and improve efficiency.Future Outlook:IMO also announced that its Kearl oil sands production is set to grow to 280,000 barrels per day by next year. It is considering raising the output to 300,000 barrels per day. This projected expansion of production is a positive sign for the company and the oil sands industry as a whole.In addition to its traditional oil and gas operations, Imperial is also investing in renewable energy. The company plans to build a 20,000 barrels per day renewable diesel plant, scheduled to start operations by early 2025. Despite subsidies provided by the Inflation Reduction Act, IMO’s renewable diesel plant will remain competitive with U.S. plants.In conclusion, Imperial’s cleanup efforts and plans for expansion in the oil sands industry are promising. Its commitment to renewable energy is another positive sign. The company’s continued investments in renewable energy will help ensure a more sustainable future for Canada and the world.Zacks Rank and Key PicksImperial is a Canadian petroleum company that operates in the upstream, downstream and chemical sectors of the oil and gas industry. It has been in operation for more than 140 years and holds a significant position in the oil sands region of Alberta, Canada.

STZ, Brown-Forman (BF.B), Molson Coors TAP and The Duckhorn Portfolio NAPA.Industry: Alcoholic BeveragesLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2081836/5-stocks-poised-to-benefit-from-favorable-alcohol-industry-trendsPlayers in the Zacks Beverages – Alcohol industry have been benefiting from the continued recovery across markets and channels, robust demand for premium and high-quality products, and innovative spirits. The diversification of product portfolios of alcohol companies has been helping boost their top lines. Companies are expected to benefit from the momentum in spirits and ready-to-drink (RTD) cocktails.However, companies in the alcohol space have been witnessing product shortages due to supply delays and other logistic issues. Escalated input, freight and packaging costs, along with higher advertising and marketing expenses, may continue to be headwinds for the industry participants.Investments in product innovations, premiumization and technology platforms bode well for players like AnheuserBusch InBev, Constellation Brands Inc., Brown-Forman, Molson Coors and The Duckhorn Portfolio.About the IndustryThe Zacks Beverages – Alcohol industry mainly comprises producers, importers, exporters, marketers and sellers of alcoholic beverages like beer, craft beer, ciders, wine, rum, whiskey, liqueurs, vodka, tequila, champagnes, brandy, amaretto, RTD cocktails and malt. Some industry players also produce and sell non-alcoholic beverages like carbonated soft drinks, sparkling waters, bottled water, energy drinks, powdered and natural juices, and RTD teas.The companies sell products through wholesalers and retailers like supermarkets, warehouse clubs, grocery stores, convenience stores, package stores, drug stores and other retail outlets. The industry participants also sell beer directly to consumers in cans and bottles at restaurants, pubs, bars and liquor stores. Some brewers operate brewpubs or taste rooms at breweries, offering consumers the freshest beer.Story continuesWhat's Shaping the Future of Beverages - Alcohol IndustryPremiumization &amp; Product Diversification: Premiumization has been a key growth driver for players in the alcohol space due to consumers' continued desires for refreshing and newer tastes. Many beverage companies are diversifying their product offerings to capture more sales. Alcohol companies have also been witnessing robust demand trends for premium and high-end products.As a result, the companies focused on innovation and portfolio premiumization stand to gain from today's market. The companies have been exploring opportunities beyond the traditional beer, whiskey, spirits and wine categories. Some popular variations, which have gained traction, include RTD spirits like canned wine and cocktails, hard seltzers, cider, and flavored malt beverages.To capitalize on the priority and consumer trends, companies have been resorting to innovative products. Most companies in the industry have collaborated to grow their shares in the fast-growing RTD category.E-Commerce Development &amp; Pricing Gains: Alcohol companies have been benefiting from the rise of e-commerce, and the recovery across markets and channels, boosting volume. Investments in online and e-commerce portals have gained prominence. Companies have been investing in the latest capabilities, and leveraging technology to better connect with customers and consumers.With a recovery in markets and channels, and the expansion of digital capabilities, players in the alcohol space look well-poised for growth. Additionally, companies have been benefiting from price increases and supply productivity savings, offsetting the effects of cost inflation. Effective marketing and exceptional commercial execution have been boosting the sale of alcohol companies.Supply-Chain Disruptions &amp; Higher Freight Costs: Players in the alcohol industry have been enduring pressures from the ongoing supply-chain constraints, and the impacts of inflationary labor, transportation and commodity costs. The industry players have been experiencing elevated ingredient and other input costs, including shipping and freight, labor, trucking, fuel, co-packing fees, secondary packaging materials, and increased outbound freight costs, leading to increased costs of sales and higher operating costs. These have been resulting in adverse gross and operating margins for beverage companies.Elevated Costs: Apart from elevated input and packaging costs, players in the alcohol industry are anticipated to witness higher advertising and promotional expenses, as well as SG&amp;A costs, further threatening profitability. Rising brand investments, particularly in media, advertising, production and local marketing, and increased freight to distributors due to higher volumes are resulting in elevated advertising, promotional and selling expenses.Growing external costs, increased compensation expenses and higher discretionary spending are expected to drive SG&amp;A deleverage. Most industry players expect the trend to continue in the near term, impacting profitability to some extent.Zacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright ProspectsThe Zacks Beverages – Alcohol industry is an 18-stock group within the broader Zacks Consumer Staples sector.

First quarter sales of EVs surged 45% from a year ago, according to Kelley Blue Book. EVs now account for 7.2% of total auto sales, according to Cox Automotive.The EV maker with the biggest brand recognition is Tesla (TSLA), but competitors Ford (F) and General Motors (GM) have been catching up.

The average price of an EV is over $61,000 that's according to Kelley Blue Book. That's $10,000 more than a gas-powered car.To offset the cost the government covers some tax credits for certain electric vehicles. The credits, , they range from $3,700 up to $7,500.SEANA SMITH: The second consideration is charging. Right now, there are over 130,000 public chargers across the US. That's a far cry from the 1.2 million needed by 2027 to support EV adoption according to S&amp;P Global Mobility.DAVE BRIGGS: The final consideration is range. Most electric cars give you 200 miles of driving range for every charge that's according to Kelley Blue Book. Some like Tesla models 3 and Y provide as much as 300 miles and the Lucid Air Dream edition gives more than 500 miles.]"

Nick Green, Thrive Market co-founder and CEO, told Yahoo Finance offering less selection on its website helps keep prices low.""Instead of going into a grocery store and having 40,000 non-perishable SKUs [stock keeping units], we've got about 5,000 or 6,000, which gives us more purchasing power...despite the inflation, we've been able to be pretty resilient in keeping our prices low, certainly relative to competitors,"" Green told Yahoo Finance Live (video above).In March, the cost of groceries went up 8.3% compared to a year prior. And although grocery inflation is down from the 13.5% peak seen in August 2022, higher grocery prices still weigh on consumer budgets and keep them looking for value.In 2022, Thrive Market brought in nearly $500 million in revenue. Thrive Market has approximately 1.2 million paid members and a valuation of more than $1 billion, based on the company's latest funding round.An annual $60 annual subscription fee for members helps to drive prices lower too, Green said. ""By getting our margin from membership, it actually gives us a lot of flexibility to push our price as low as we possibly can.""Another strategy to keep prices low is asking members to spend at least $49 to qualify for free shipping.Green said this minimum encourages customers to add more to their order and said the threshold is ""less about cost and a lot more about our mission"" to make healthy, sustainable living affordable and accessible to all.Typically, a Thrive Market order has more than 15 items and more than $90 worth of products.""The impact of that is good for the business. It means we can actually offer more savings because we don't have as much cost in shipping and packaging and that's really good for the environment where we can use ground shipping,"" Green said. ""So we're able to get to more than half our members in one day or less on shipping. We're able to get to 95% in two days or less.""Story continues(Courtesy: Thrive Market) (Elisha Knight | Thrive Market)While Thrive Market competes with the growing online grocery space, which is expected reach $235.86 billion in sales by 2026, Green said the company's ""profits and the purpose go hand in hand.""On Wednesday, the company converted to a Public Benefit Corporation.Green said many outsiders assume a mission to serve people, purpose, and the planet will come at the expense of profits. ""We really found the exact opposite to be the case,"" Green said, because the ""mission resonates with people"" and leads to customer loyalty, renewal rates, and referrals.Onesies and twosiesMore packages and day-of deliveries means more problems for the planet, Green said.Once consumers learn about that impact, he said they decide to turn away from mega companies known for that like Amazon (AMZN).""People order on Amazon for those onesy, twosies because they can,"" Green said. ""Once you tell people what the impact of that is on the environment, a lot of them do want to change their purchasing behaviors.""In a typical day, Amazon ships approximately 1.6 million packages, per the Amazon seller software tool LandingCube. That means 66,000 orders are delivered every hour.Green explained the impact: ""If you're trying to deliver day-of, your carbon footprint is going to be a lot higher. If you're trying to do air shipping to get next-day from a geographic distance, you're going to be using an order of magnitude, more carbon footprint.""Brooke DiPalma is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

When evaluating insider transactions, knowing whether insiders are buying versus if they selling is usually more beneficial, as the latter can be open to many interpretations. However, shareholders should take a deeper look if several insiders are selling stock over a specific time period.While insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing. Check out our latest analysis for Target Target Insider Transactions Over The Last YearThe Executive VP, Don Liu, made the biggest insider sale in the last 12 months. That single transaction was for US$2.0m worth of shares at a price of US$167 each. That means that an insider was selling shares at around the current price of US$160. We generally don't like to see insider selling, but the lower the sale price, the more it concerns us. In this case, the big sale took place at around the current price, so it's not too bad (but it's still not a positive).Target insiders didn't buy any shares over the last year. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!insider-trading-volumeIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free list of growing companies that insiders are buying.Insiders At Target Have Sold Stock RecentlyThe last three months saw significant insider selling at Target. Specifically, Executive VP Don Liu ditched US$2.0m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. Overall this makes us a bit cautious, but it's not the be all and end all.Does Target Boast High Insider Ownership?Many investors like to check how much of a company is owned by insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Target insiders own about US$209m worth of shares (which is 0.3% of the company). Most shareholders would be happy to see this sort of insider ownership, since it suggests that management incentives are well aligned with other shareholders.Story continuesSo What Does This Data Suggest About Target Insiders?An insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. Looking to the last twelve months, our data doesn't show any insider buying. The company boasts high insider ownership, but we're a little hesitant, given the history of share sales. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Our analysis shows 5 warning signs for Target (1 makes us a bit uncomfortable!) and we strongly recommend you look at these before investing.Of course Target may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free collection of high quality companies.For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body.

The company’s earnings and revenues are expected to have witnessed year-over-year declines.This Wilmington, DE-based lender’s fourth-quarter 2022 earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate primarily due to a fall in net interest income (NII) and total other income. Also, higher provisions hindered the results. Nonetheless, a decrease in expenses was a tailwind.NAVI has a mixed earnings surprise history. Navient’s earnings outpaced estimates in two of the trailing four quarters and missed twice, the average beat being 6.24%.Navient Corporation Price and EPS Surprise Navient Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseNavient Corporation price-eps-surprise | Navient Corporation QuoteNAVI’s activities in the to-be-reported quarter were adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. As a result, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings of 88 cents per share has moved marginally upward in the past week. However, the figure indicates a 2.22% decline from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.The consensus estimate for revenues of $230.68 million indicates a decline of 16.42% from the year-ago reported figure.Key Factors to NotePer the Fed’s latest data, consumer loan declined in the quarter under review. Federal Reserve hiked rates by 50 basis points in the to-be-reported quarter and 25 bps in the prior quarter. With this, the policy rate reached 4.75-5% in March 2023, the highest since 2008. Such successive rate hikes are likely to have limited any further positive impact on Navient’s NII.Hence, a weakening lending scenario and lower-to-no positive impact of higher rates are anticipated to have affected NII in the quarter.Nonetheless, the consensus estimate for NII is pegged at $275 million, suggesting a sequential increase of 23.3%.The increasing interest rate environment is anticipated to have affected its net interest margin in the Federal Education Loans and Consumer Lending segments.Weakness in fee income is expected to have kept Navient’s top line under pressure in the to-be-reported quarter. Fee income declined sequentially in the fourth quarter due to a decrease in transition services performed in connection with the Department of Education servicing contract being transferred. A similar trend is expected to have continued in the quarter under review.The pandemic-related contract expirations are expected to have continued to affect revenues in the Business Processing segment.Nonetheless, the consensus estimate for servicing revenues is pegged at $17.33 million, suggesting a 2% increase from the prior quarter’s reported figure. The consensus mark for asset recovery and business processing revenues suggests a sequential rise of 2.8% to $74 million.With this, the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 98 million for total fee income indicates a decline of 10.1% from the prior-quarter’s reported figure.Navient’s initiatives to become a technologically-advanced company and its aim to expand services outside the education industry are expected to have led to elevated expenses, affecting bottom-line growth.Story continuesWhat Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model conclusively predicts an earnings beat for Navient this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat, which is the case here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP for Navient is +2.36%.Zacks Rank: Navient currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3.

210,c20b5306-6806-3df4-9c69-6761b82a58ff,CSX,2023-04-22,Recent uptick might appease CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) institutional owners after losing 6.6% over the past year,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/recent-uptick-might-appease-csx-110025590.html,1682161225,STORY,['CSX'],"[Key InsightsInstitutions' substantial holdings in CSX implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price49% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholdersUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a companyA look at the shareholders of CSX Corporation (NASDAQ:CSX) can tell us which group is most powerful. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 75% to be precise, is institutions. Put another way, the group faces the maximum upside potential (or downside risk).Last week's US$2.3b market cap gain would probably be appreciated by institutional investors, especially after a year of 6.6% losses.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of CSX. See our latest analysis for CSX ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About CSX?Many institutions measure their performance against an index that approximates the local market. So they usually pay more attention to companies that are included in major indices.CSX already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see CSX's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. CSX is not owned by hedge funds. Our data shows that The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the largest shareholder with 9.0% of shares outstanding. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 6.8% and 6.6% of the stock.Story continuesOn studying our ownership data, we found that 25 of the top shareholders collectively own less than 50% of the share register, implying that no single individual has a majority interest.While it makes sense to study institutional ownership data for a company, it also makes sense to study analyst sentiments to know which way the wind is blowing. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of CSXWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of CSX Corporation in their own names. It is a very large company, so it would be surprising to see insiders own a large proportion of the company. Though their holding amounts to less than 1%, we can see that board members collectively own US$65m worth of shares (at current prices). Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 25% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Case in point: We've spotted   1 warning sign for CSX  you should be aware of.If you are like me, you may want to think about whether this company will grow or shrink. Luckily, you can check this free report showing analyst forecasts for its future.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

(NASDAQ: CSX) has recognized the sustainability achievements of 13 rail customers by naming them 2023 CSX Customer Environmental Excellence Award winners.In the second year of the annual awards program, CSX chose winners in two categories: highway-to-rail conversions and innovation.“Freight shippers are increasingly choosing rail transportation to support a cleaner environment while taking advantage of CSX’s service reliability and innovative supply chain solutions,” said Kevin Boone, executive vice president of sales and marketing. “The CSX Environmental Excellence Awards recognize the efforts of our customers who are reducing their carbon footprint through sustainable transportation choices.”Customers who choose rail over truck transportation can typically reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% to 80%. A typical CSX freight train can carry the cargo load of 280 trucks and is three to four times more fuel-efficient than highway transportation. CSX recently launched an enhanced carbon calculator that allows companies to determine emissions savings on specific shipments and gain insight into maximizing supply chain sustainability.The 2023 CSX Customer Environmental Excellence Award winners include companies whose highway-to-rail conversions resulted in substantial emissions savings during the previous year. In addition, innovation awards were presented to customers who demonstrated the greatest environmental ingenuity through their transportation initiatives. Among those receiving awards are:Highway-to-rail Conversion AwardsFordMillerCoorsNational CementSylvamo North AmericaUnileverUSG Corporation (United States Gypsum)Innovation AwardsGeorgia-Pacific, for its announced Dixie Paper manufacturing facility in Jackson, Tennessee.Nucor, for its announced sheet mill plant in Apple Grove, West Virginia.CSX is recognized as a transportation industry leader in sustainability. In 2020, the company became the first railroad in the United States to align with the Science Based Targets initiative, setting a goal to reduce GHG emissions intensity by 37.3 percent by 2030, using 2014 as a baseline. The company has earned a place on the Dow Jones Sustainability Index for 12 consecutive years, ranks first among all U.S. transportation and logistics companies in Newsweek magazine’s list of America’s Most Responsible Companies, and was the only transportation company on the Forbes 2021 “Green Growth 50”.Story continuesAbout CSX CSX, based in Jacksonville, Florida, is a premier transportation company.

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend-Paying Stocks Under $50. The current inflationary environment has turned investors’ attention toward income-generating stocks as they look for regular income streams. When inflation is high, the value of money declines, and investors need to find investments that can provide returns that at least keep up with inflation. Dividend-paying stocks can be a good choice because they provide a steady stream of income that can help offset the effects of inflation. In addition to this, some companies may increase their dividends to keep up with this environment, providing even more protection against the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation. Some of the best dividend stocks that are popular among investors include Lowe’s Companies Inc. (NYSE:LOW), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI).During previous inflationary periods, dividend stocks outperformed other asset classes and significantly contributed to the market’s overall returns. According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividends represented over 41% of the market’s returns since the 1940s and the percentage increased during periods when inflation was high. We also previously reported that during the decades of the 1940s and the 1970s, when inflation reached its record high, dividends accounted for 53% and 50% of the stock market’s total return, respectively.Analysts also advise investing in dividend stocks in this environment to decrease volatility and for some downside protection. John Sheehy, manager of Fidelity Equity Dividend Income Fund, spoke to Fidelity Investments about the importance of dividend investments during periods of market fluctuations. Here are some comments from the analyst:""Income from dividends is a head start in any market, which is why dividend-paying stocks have historically fared well in low-return markets and provided good downside risk protection in challenging markets such as 2022.""Story continuesHe further emphasized that investors should not focus on dividend yields when investing in dividend stocks as high yields may indicate higher payout ratios. Instead, companies with strong financials and solid balance sheets should be their choices. He said:""I look for the ability to maintain and grow dividends over time, which implies a resilient business model.""Readers can also have a look at 25 Best Stocks for Dividends to know more about dividend stocks and their importance.14 Best Dividend Paying Stocks Under $50Image by Steve Buissinne from PixabayOur Methodology:We scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds and picked 14 dividend stocks priced under $50 as of April 7.

The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow per share (what could be paid to us if management wanted to) has increased 22%, from $2.73 to $3.33, while leverage has come down a little over ½ a turn. So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio. We’ll continue to own this company unless the shares become meaningfully overvalued, and if it gets cheaper, we would be very comfortable owning more.”13.

Profits at the Phoenix-based lender dropped 41% from a year earlier.And yet its stock rose 24% the day after announcing those results.Investors have been looking for any signs that the crisis that saw three US banks fail in a matter of days back in early March is over. They're particularly keen for signals from the regional banks most vulnerable to the panic that cascaded through the financial system in the weeks that followed.Reports over the past week from more than 15 regional lenders offered plenty of those signs, as multiple executives said the deposit outflows they saw in March had since stabilized or even reversed.Horizon Investments head of portfolio strategy Zach Hill called the earnings results this past week ""better than feared.""The banking crisis ""does feel like it's largely contained,"" added Quant Insight head of analytics Huw Roberts.Wedbush analyst David Chiaverini told Yahoo Finance the theme dominating this earnings season so far is ""less than feared.""At Western Alliance, deposits rose by $2 billion in the first two weeks of April.""The waters are now calmer,"" Western Alliance CEO Ken Vecchione told analysts this week.This doesn’t mean, however, that all is fine for the many mid-sized banks that lack the power or diversity of industry giants such as JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Bank of America (BAC).Many of these smaller institutions said they now expect to earn less on their loans and pay more for their deposits, thus lowering expectations of revenue and profits in the future. Some also said they expect stricter federal banking regulations that could force them to raise more capital.On Friday Moody's reinforced this challenging outlook by downgrading ratings for 11 regional lenders, including a two-notch cut for Western Alliance, citing ""a deterioration in the operating environment and funding conditions for US banks.""Story continues""Some of the immediate problems have gone away but the reality is with interest rates higher the banks’ business model is going to have to change, and that’s going to play out over months and quarters and even years,"" Commonwealth Financial Network CIO Brad McMillan told Yahoo Finance.Higher costs, lower profitsTheir problems start with a critical source of funding for smaller institutions: deposits. Even before the failure of Silicon Valley Bank, bank customers who were earning little interest from their accounts had begun moving their money to higher-yielding alternatives such as certificates of deposit or money market funds.That outflow accelerated in March. Comerica (CMA), a regional bank in Dallas, said its deposits fell 9% during the first three months of the year. Zions (ZION), a Salt Lake City lender, said they dropped 3.4%.That forced many regional lenders to start paying more to keep depositors or attract them back. Deposit costs for Comerica rose 2,850% from a year ago, to $118 million. At Zions, these costs were up 1,266%, to $82 million. At Cincinnati lender Fifth Third (FITB) and Cleveland lender KeyCorp (KEY), the increases were 4,245% and 2,400%, respectively. Comerica and Zions were among the banks that received downgrades from Moody's on Friday.A Comerica bank branch. Credit: BauerGriffin/MediaPunch /IPX (AaronP/MediaPunch/IPx)Those higher costs, in turn, are beginning to cut into a key measure of profitability known as net interest income, which is the difference between what a bank earns on its loans and pays out on its deposits. Many regional banks said their net interest income dropped from the fourth quarter of 2022 and they expect it to drop again in the second quarter of this year as the Federal Reserve keeps interest rates high.KeyCorp and Fifth Third were among the banks that reduced their net interest income expectations. Comerica said it expects that number to drop 11-13% in the three months ending June 30.But Comerica executives also said they expect some of the deposits they lost to come back. Much of the outflows in March, they said, happened because long standing customers decided to move some excess amounts elsewhere. Because those relationships are strong, customers may return.""I don’t think we are going to have to pay up for it,"" senior executive vice president Peter Sefzik told analysts Thursday.'No crisis inside our four walls'Several executives from regional banks said some concerns about their corner of the industry were overhyped. After all, recent data shows that deposit outflows among banks below $250 billion in assets have slowed since March. These institutions even regained $20 billion in the two weeks ending April 12, according to Fed data released Friday.Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence told analysts Thursday his institution is particularly well situated to benefit from a recent surge in manufacturing jobs across his regions in the Midwest.""Markets have been trading on narratives over fundamentals,"" he said, adding that ""there was no crisis inside our four walls.""Western Alliance's CEO, Vecchione, admitted that depositors withdrew $8 billion from his bank in one day during March but said deposits began returning within a week. After gaining back $2 billion during the first two weeks of April it expects to pull in another $2 billion per quarter this year.""We've returned to a lot more calm,"" Vecchione said.Some of that new industry calm could get tested again next week as more regional banks report results. Plenty of investors will be paying close attention to one specific name that was at the center of last month’s crisis, First Republic (FRC), which is scheduled to release first-quarter earnings Monday. In March the San Francisco lender took a $30 billion deposit infusion from 11 rival banks in a bid to restore confidence. It was also among the banks that received downgrades from Moody's on Friday, specifically on its preferred-stock rating.A lot of money is riding on its fate. Everyday investors have bet $245 million on First Republic stock since the fall of Silicon Valley Bank, according to Vanda Research, the third highest inflow to a specific bank stock behind Bank of America and Charles Schwab (SCHW). It also has one of the highest levels of interest among so-called short sellers betting on the stock to decline, according to analytics firm S3 Partners, accounting for $480 million in such bets over the last 30 days.First Republic ""will be a bellwether of sentiment for the sector"" Vanda said in a note this past week.Western Alliance’s CEO told analysts Wednesday that his bank had proved it was now in a different category than First Republic.""There was a point where whatever happened to them affected us. But I think we've now separated ourselves.""Click here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocksRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance]"

Welcome to Regions First Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. John and David will provide high-level commentary regarding the quarter. Earnings documents, which include our forward-looking statement disclaimer and non-GAAP information are available in the Investor Relations section of our website. These disclosures cover our presentation materials, prepared comments and Q&amp;A. I will now turn the call over to John.John M. TurnerThank you, Dana, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you joining our call today. Once again, Regions delivered another solid quarter, underscoring our commitment to generating consistent sustainable long-term performance. We generated earnings of $588 million, resulting in earnings per share of $0.62. Despite recent events in the banking industry, we remain focused on the fundamentals and things we can control. We've spent over a decade enhancing our interest rate risk, credit risk, capital and liquidity management frameworks. Our relationship-based banking approach, coupled with our favorable geographic footprint uniquely positions us to weather an uncertain market backdrop. Further, balance and diversity on both sides of the balance sheet have been a key focus for years. As a result, we are well positioned to withstand an array of economic conditions. Approximately 70% of our deposits are retail deposits. These deposits tend to be granular and less rate sensitive. In fact, approximately 90% of these deposits are insured. Our strategy focuses on primacy and customer loyalty. We want to be our customers' primary banking relationship. This strategy is evident in the fact that over 90% of our consumer checking households include a high-quality checking account, and over 60% of consumer checking deposit balances are with customers that have been with Regions for 10 years or more. Our wholesale or business services deposits are also highly diversified from an industry, size and geography perspective, with approximately 75% of deposits that are either insured, operational in nature or collateralized. In total, approximately 75% of our deposits across all business lines are insured or collateralized by securities and our deposits are with customers we know is over 97% reside within our 15-state footprint. Further supporting our high-quality deposit franchise, we had access to total primary liquidity of approximately $41 billion at the end of the quarter, sufficient to cover uninsured retail and nonoperational wholesale deposits by more than a 2:1 ratio. If you include access to the Federal Reserve discount window, available liquidity increases to $54 billion or approximately 3:1 coverage. We have a strong team of bankers and the recent disruption has given us an opportunity to connect with our customers and top prospects to answer questions and reassure them of our stability. We've experienced some deposit outflows as corporate treasurers look to diversify and sought higher interest rates for their excess cash. However, we've also experienced deposit inflows from new and existing customers. Importantly, our total deposits at March 31 were roughly unchanged from what they were prior to the onset of liquidity concerns in the industry. The majority of the $3 billion deposit decrease this quarter was as expected, due primarily to further normalization in corporate deposits, which had dramatically increased during the pandemic, as well as the continuation of rate-seeking behavior in certain wealth and higher balance consumer accounts. From a lending perspective, our focus on risk-adjusted returns continues. Overall sentiment among our corporate customers remains positive. While most are forecasting strong performance in 2023, they are expecting modest declines from levels seen in 2022. While current market conditions weren't heightened caution, we believe our strong liquidity profile provides an advantage in terms of supporting our customers' borrowing needs. In closing, despite all the industry turmoil, we feel very good about our balance sheet and strong liquidity position. And through our proactive hedging strategies, we are positioned for success in any interest rate environment. Our granular deposit base and relationship-based banking model continue to serve us well, and we're proud to continue supporting our customers' banking needs. Now Dave will provide some highlights regarding the quarter.Story continuesDavid Jackson TurnerThank you, John. Let's start with the balance sheet. Average loans increased 2% sequentially. Average business loans increased 2% compared to the prior quarter, reflecting high-quality, broad-based growth across the utilities, retail trade and financial services industries. Approximately 87% of this growth was again driven by existing clients accessing and expanding their credit lines to rebuild inventories and expand their businesses. Average consumer loans increased 1% as growth in mortgage and interbank was partially offset by continued pay downs in home equity and runoff exit portfolios. Looking forward, we continue to expect 2023 ending loan growth of approximately 4%. From a deposit standpoint, our deposit base remains a strength and competitive advantage with balances continuing to largely perform as expected. Previously, we indicated the combination of rapidly rising interest rates and normalization of surge deposits would likely lead to $3 billion to $5 billion of deposit declines by midyear before we would begin to generate net deposit growth. While the events in March created turmoil in the banking industry, we continue to believe that range is appropriate. However, we may be at the higher end of the range as we approach midyear. The preponderance of deposit outflows this quarter occurred prior to early March and were in line with our expectations. Approximately $2 billion of the $3 billion outflow came from corporate deposits, reflecting normal seasonal activity. The other $1 billion came from a continuation of rate-seeking behavior among certain wealth and higher balance consumer clients. The same characteristics that contribute to our deposit advantage in a rising rate environment are also helpful in a time of systemic volatility. As John noted, our focus on attracting and retaining a diverse and granular deposit base with high primacy drives loyalty and trust and instills funding stability. So let's shift to net interest income and margin. Net interest income continued to expand with market interest rates in the first quarter, reflecting our asset-sensitive profile and funding stability. Net interest income grew 1% linked quarter to a record $1.4 billion and net interest margin increased 23 basis points to 4.22%. As the Federal Reserve nears the end of its tightening cycle, net interest income is supported by elevated floating rate loan and cash yields at higher market interest rates and fixed rate asset turnover from the maturity of low-yielding loans and securities generated through the pandemic. At this stage in the rate cycle, we expect accelerating deposit costs through repricing and remixing. Importantly, recent trends remain within our expectation. The cycle-to-date deposit beta is 19%, and our guidance for 2023 is unchanged, a 35% full-cycle beta by year-end. We remain confident that our deposit composition will provide a meaningful competitive advantage for Regions when compared to the broader industry. Net interest income is projected to grow between 12% and 14% in 2023 when compared to 2022. The midpoint of the range is supported by the March 31 market forward yield curve, which projects nearly 75 basis points of rate cuts in 2023, a stable Fed funds level would push net interest income to the upper end of the range. The balance sheet hedging program is an important source of our earnings stability in today's uncertain environment. Hedges added to date create a well-protected net interest margin profile through 2025. Forward-starting receive-fixed swaps will become effective in the latter half of 2023, and '24 and generally have a term of 3 years. Activity in the first quarter focused on extending that protection beyond 2025. In addition to forward-starting swaps, we added a $1.5 billion collars strategy, selling rate caps to pay for rate floors to limit exposure to extreme market rate movements. The resulting balance sheet is constructed to support a net interest margin range of 3.6% to 4% over the coming years, even if interest rates move back towards 1%. If rates remain elevated, our net interest margin is projected to remain above the high end of the range until deposits fully reprice. So let's take a look at fee revenue and expense. Adjusted noninterest income declined 3% from the prior quarter as modest increases in service charges and wealth management income were offset by declines in other categories. primarily capital markets and card and ATM fees. Service charges increased slightly as seasonally higher treasury management fees offset declines in overdraft fees. Excluding the impact of CVA and DVA, capital markets increased 4% sequentially as growth in real estate capital markets, loan syndications, and debt and securities underwriting more than offset declines in M&amp;A fees and commercial swaps. We did have a negative $33 million CVA and DVA adjustment, reflecting lower long-term interest rates, volatility in credit spreads as well as a refinement in our valuation methodology. Card and ATM fees were negatively impacted by a $5 million increase in reserves, driven by higher reward redemption rates. With respect to our outlook, and incorporating first quarter results, we expect full year 2023 adjusted total revenue to be up 6% to 8% compared to 2022. Let's move on to noninterest expense. Adjusted noninterest expenses increased 1% compared to the prior quarter. Salaries and benefits increased 2%, primarily due to merit and a seasonal increase in payroll taxes. FDIC insurance assessment reflects the previously announced industry-wide increase in the assessment rate schedules. In contrast to the prior 2 years, we expect first half 2023 adjusted expenses to be higher than the second half of the year. And we continue to expect full year 2023 adjusted noninterest expenses to be up 4.5% to 5.5%. We now expect to generate positive adjusted operating leverage of approximately 2%. From an asset quality standpoint, overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected. Net charge-offs were 35 basis points in the quarter. Nonperforming loans and business services criticized loans increased while total delinquencies decreased. Provision expense was $135 million, while the allowance for credit loss ratio remained unchanged at 1.63%. The amount of the allowance increase due primarily to economic changes and normalizing credit from historically low levels, partially offset by a reduction associated with the elimination of the accounting for troubled debt restructured loans. It is worth noting the outcome of the most recent Shared National Credit exam is reflected in our results. I want to take a few minutes to speak to our commercial real estate portfolio. Since 2008, we have deliberately limited our exposure to this space. At quarter end, our exposure totaled 15% of loans, excluding owner-occupied and it is highly diverse. This total includes $8.4 billion of investor real estate and $6.7 billion of unsecured exposure, of which the vast majority is within real estate investment trust. Our REIT clients generally have low leverage and strong access to liquidity with 68% classified as investment grade. Importantly, total office represents just 1.8% of total loans at $1.8 billion. Of note, 83% consist of Class A properties with 62% located within the Sunbelt. The office portfolio was originated with an approximate weighted average loan-to-value of 58% and we have stressed the portfolio to include a 25% discount using the Green Street commercial property price index with the weighted average resulting loan-to-value of the book approximating 77%. It is also noteworthy that 37% of our secured office portfolio is single-tenant. While we are carefully monitoring conditions, we believe our portfolio will be able to weather the weakness in the industry. Including first quarter results, we now expect our full year 2023 net charge-off ratio to be approximately 35 basis points. Given the recent economic uncertainty and market volatility, we may see a pickup in the pace of normalization towards our through-the-cycle annual charge-off range of 35 to 45 basis points over time. From a capital standpoint, we ended the quarter with a common equity Tier 1 ratio at an estimated 9.8%, reflecting solid capital generation through earnings, partially offset by continued loan growth and approximately $100 million or 7 basis points related to the phase-in of CECL into regulatory capital. Given current macroeconomic conditions, and regulatory uncertainty, we anticipate managing capital levels at or modestly above 10% over the near-term. So in closing, we delivered solid results in the first quarter despite volatile conditions. We have balance and diversity on both sides of the balance sheet and are well positioned to withstand an array of economic conditions. We are in some of the strongest markets in the country. And while we remain vigilant to indicators of potential market contraction, we will continue to be a source of stability to our customers. Pre-tax pre-provision income remained strong, expenses are well controlled, credit remains broadly stable, and capital and liquidity levels remain robust. With that, we'll move to the Q&amp;A portion of the call.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.Ryan Matthew NashDavid, maybe a question on betas and deposit balances. So you guys are one of the few that isn't increasing your deposit beta guidance given that you're at 19% and I think expectations are for 35%. Can you maybe just talk about where you expect the pressure to come from? I think you noted in the remarks, repricing and remixing, how much will each of these contribute? Are you expecting more to be in retail given the push for insured deposits? Or is it on the commercial side? And then second, you noted that you do expect to see stabilization of growth in balances later in the year. Can you maybe just talk about what you see driving that as we move through the year?David Jackson TurnerSure. So as we've mentioned before, we had $41 billion worth of surge deposits. We didn't think those would stay with us as long as they actually have stayed with us. And we furthermore said as rates continue to increase that people would be seeking higher returns than we were offering at the time. And so you can see our cumulative beta, as you mentioned, at 19%, well below everybody else. We do understand that we're going to end up -- there's going to be a shift of deposits into CDs, more expensive deposits. And so we do also expect some continued runoff. We had given you the guide of $3 billion to $5 billion. We're down $3.3 billion. We expect to be at the upper end of that by the end of the second quarter. And a lot of that is putting money to work in businesses, but also some seeking higher rates. And so the combination of where we are relative to our deposit costs relative to the peers would imply that we would be increasing some of that over time, and that's going to drive our beta, and we still believe 35% is the right number by the end of the cycle, which we're calling the end of this year.Ryan Matthew NashGot it. And maybe as a follow-up, so you guys are now expecting losses at the high end of your previous guidance. It looks like the increase this quarter was driven by C&amp;I. And I think, David, I think you just noted you could see a pickup in the pace of normalization. Can you maybe just talk about, one, what is driving the incremental pressure? And what are you expecting to be the higher driver of charge-offs, both for the rest of this year and then the pace of normalization that we could see?David Jackson TurnerWell, so as we've, I believe, stated many times, the charge-off level is below normal. And that we said it would be normalizing over time. We've furthermore set our normalized loss rate based on the risk profile we maintain is 35 to 45 bps. As we get through the end of this year, we're trying to give you the message that, that could kind of lead you into a run rate towards that 35 to 45 bps by the end of the year. We're already at 35 this quarter, which would imply we expect a reduction in charge-offs in the second and/or third quarter. But all in, we still think we're going to be at 35 basis points, which is below normal. So we have a lot of confidence in that. We had certain things that happened in the first quarter we don't think will repeat. And so I think our 35 bps is a pretty good number.John M. TurnerYes. Ryan, I'd just add to the question about where we're seeing the stress. We've identified a couple of areas on previous calls where we are experiencing some stress in the portfolio. That would be health care, where we're seeing rising costs and pressure on labor. Transportation, particularly on the smaller end of the transportation sector where customers are competing in the spot market to move product. Consumer discretionary, where consumers are changing their buying patterns and moving away from more discretionary items towards services where we're seeing some pressure, office obviously and then senior housing, which is a sector that we believe is improving but still not returned to occupancy levels that we experienced prior to the pandemic. And again, it's a sector where labor is a factor in the operations of those businesses and driving cost up. So those are all areas where we are seeing more pressure than in the rest of the portfolio. And I would finally comment, I think we'll see some additional ""movement"" toward normalization. But we've probably gotten there a little faster than I think we thought we would. So we don't expect a whole lot of additional deterioration as we move towards normalization.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS.Erika NajarianMy first question is for David. You continue to have that line about a long-term NIM of 3.6% to 4%. I think investors are starting to think about rate cut in 2024, and (inaudible) always ask about 2024, but I think investors are thinking about how inexpensive bank stocks are really right, trying to evaluate them on what could be trough earnings next year. So if the Fed cuts, can you still stay within that range? And I think nobody is expecting a cut to 0, but perhaps walk us through the scenario of that range in the scenario of like a 200 basis point cut over 1 year?David Jackson TurnerYes. So the bottom line answer is yes, we do feel comfortable under any scenario as we mentioned that we would operate in that 3.60% to 4% range. Clearly, our guidance is based on the market. I mean, on the March 31 forward that has 3 cuts, 75 basis points worth of cuts after one increase. So to the extent that were to happen, we will still be within that range. If it stays higher than that, then we'd be at the upper end of the range. And we have some receive-fixed swaps that actually come on board in the second half of the year to protect us from lower rates. We're not saying that the rates will be cut. That's what the market says. I personally don't see that, that will happen at that pace. But we wanted to be able to center the discussion on what the market is saying, and that's why we gave you that and then we gave you some sensitivity around it. So we feel very good about the range. Where we are in the range? There are a whole lot of factors. The pace, the timing of cuts would take us down even if we had a couple of hundred basis points of cuts, then '24, we're still in the range. So does that get you what you wanted?Erika NajarianYes. And as we think about perhaps a more measured pace of cut, how would you anticipate being able to normalize your deposit costs in that backdrop?David Jackson TurnerSay that again, how would we? Say it again, Erika.Erika NajarianYes, how quickly could you lower deposit costs in an environment where the Fed is cutting in a measured pace? I'm just trying to think about the other side as I think about your sort of your long-term NIM target range?David Jackson TurnerYes. Well, so you can see our deposit cost relative to our peers is 19% (inaudible) lagging. And so the ability to cut, we have to be competitive. We have to offer a fair price to our customer base. And I think to the extent you start seeing a pause and/or cuts coming from the Fed. The beta that we just mentioned could change and may not be as severe. What happens is the increase in deposit cost lagged the last increase of -- that the Fed is going to have. So it will take some time for that to manifest itself. So if you look at the retail side, the retail side is very slow to react. But on the commercial side, it's almost instantaneous as treasurers look to lock in the best yield that they can. We have some index deposits that move with changes in Fed funds. So that will react pretty quickly, which I think is a benefit to us in that scenario.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of John Pancari with Evercore.John G. PancariIn terms of your maintaining the cumulative or through-cycle beta at 35%, I hear you where you're trending down 19% in your confidence. But I'm just curious how the liquidity crisis through March and how it really impacted that outlook. We saw a number of other banks increased their deposit beta expectations given the intensifying pressure around deposit costs as well as broader funding costs. So how has the liquidity crisis impacted your view? And how does that not influence an increase in how you're thinking about the through-cycle data? If you could just walk us through that.David Jackson TurnerYes, John. So our -- this is our competitive advantage is our deposit base. And so we haven't had to react at the pace that others. So if you look at the incremental beta of our core peer group, that was some 73% this quarter. And ours was 40%, 41%. So we just haven't had to move at the pace and I still think based on how we fund ourselves, the core retail, 70% of our deposits being retail really has helped us from being able to keep that beta where it is at 35%. So as we think about some of the larger customers that are seeking rates, seeking returns, that's where there's been more competitive pressure and we saw some of that being put to work in the first quarter. And we called for some of that. That's part of the $3 billion to $5 billion that we're talking about. As a matter of fact, in our beta assumption, we had all that coming out of noninterest bearing. That wasn't quite what we saw, but we gave it -- we assumed noninterest-bearing because that was more conservative to give you the guidance. And so if you take all that into consideration, I think that's why you didn't see us change our cumulative beta to 35%. And being at 19%, there's a long way to go from 19% to 35%. We understand that, but if we miss it, maybe it's a tad underneath that, which is why we gave you also some guidance on our Slide #7, that would show you if beta was a little bit better than 35%, how much it might be.John G. PancariGot it, David. That's helpful. And then separately on the capital front. I know you increased your target to 10% -- and just if -- or 10% or just above, I believe you said. If you could maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of the rationale. And then could that allow for buybacks at some point? How are you thinking about deployment and the pace of where you -- the timing of when you get to around that 10% range?David Jackson TurnerSure. So you saw our Common Equity Tier 1 increase from 9.6% to 9.8%, and that's after absorbing about 7 basis points due to the CECL impact for the first quarter. So we're generating 20 to 30 basis points worth of CET1 every quarter. After loan growth, we first and foremost want to be here as a source of strength for our customers and be able to make all creditworthy loans we can make. And we're open for business and ready to do that. That's what our job is. We want to make sure we pay our shareholders a fair dividend, 35% to 45% of our earnings in the form of a dividend, and we have been at the lower end of that. But -- and then we've used our capital for other nonbank acquisitions and mortgage servicing right acquisitions, which we'd like to continue. And then to optimize our capital, we'll buy stock back from time to time. Given the uncertainty that's in the market, obviously, there's a lot of review going on to what happened in the month of March, and there's going to be some reports coming out from our regulatory supervisors on what may change. And we just want to be prepared for that, and we think it would be inappropriate at this time to be buying our stock back when we have this kind of uncertainty. You'll lop on top of that the uncertainty in the economy and monetary policy. So there's just a lot of noise, which caused us to rethink, let's just wait, let us accrete up to that 10%, maybe slightly over that. And to the extent things settle down, then we'll optimize capital, and we'll use share repurchases as a mechanism to do so.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank.Matthew Derek O'ConnorHow are you thinking about managing liquidity going forward? Obviously, like with a very strong deposit base, you've been less reliant on wholesale borrowing. But both in light of current conditions and then just kind of the way the regulation might be moving. What are you thinking about in terms of borrowings and then also both cash and securities. And again, like you've got a smaller AFS book than others, which has worked well given the moving rates. But what's the outlook on both the funding and asset side?David Jackson TurnerYes. So we still believe in growing customer relationships, core checking accounts and operating accounts of businesses. It's the basis of our whole business, and we'll continue to do that from -- to help us from a liquidity standpoint. Clearly, some things have changed. We've given you a list of our total primary liquidity and also liquidity at the discount window should we need it. What we've learned, I think, over this, is that it can move much quicker that we all had anticipated the world has changed a bit. And so we've had one of the largest cash balances of anybody in the peer group the lower securities book. And we did that intentionally because we were not clear on the surge deposits on the pace that they would move out. So we'll probably maintain a bit more cash than we historically have been. Obviously, there's -- currently, there's a new term bank facility that the Fed created that's temporary. I hope there's some thinking about how to maybe keep some of that in place. But we did not use that, as you can tell from our disclosures. But we tested it after quarter end, just to make sure the pipes were worked up and I think we borrowed $1,000 and repaid it quickly. But posting collateral to something like that, that you can get access to quickly. Clearly, the Federal Home Loan Bank is still our primary source we go to. We have a little bit outstanding there at quarter end, a couple of billion dollars. And so just having access to multiple levels, if we learned anything, it's diversification. And you need to make sure your funding side is diverse. And within your deposit base, it needs to be diverse. So if you end up with a concentration, you end up with a problem. So I think that's a big lesson learned for everybody and staying as diverse, so we can a little more cash on hand I think, is in order.Matthew Derek O'ConnorAnd then specifically on the securities book, how would you think about that relative to assets kind of near or longer term with the current framework?David Jackson TurnerWe've historically been in that 20% range of earning assets, and we don't see that changing dramatically. I think we need to be careful. There's been a lot of discussion about shortening up maturities and things of that nature. And we need to be real careful because there could be broad implications of that. The banking system is a big buyer of mortgage-backed securities, and we need to support the mortgage industry and the housing industry and consumers that way. So we are forced to go too short. There are much broader implications to the economy. So we're going to be careful of that. We'll see what the policymakers come up with and we'll adapt and overcome as we see fit. But right now, I think having a book about where we've been, which is a little lower than others, I think, is the right spot for us based on our -- again, our funding profile.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC.Gerard Sean CassidyJohn or David, or both of you, obviously, Regions has derisked its balance sheet dramatically from the '08, '09 time period. And so I think you guys are in a good position to maybe handle this question, specifically for commercial real estate, can you guys share with us the differences that you are seeing in the current commercial real estate market in your portfolio versus what it was like in '08, '09. Now granted, I know you've lowered the exposure. So that's a major difference. But in terms of the cap rates, obviously, have moved up, the refinancing risk is here. But can you share with us how you guys could handle that more -- I'm assuming more easily today than what happened in '08, '09.John M. TurnerYes. Gerard, this is John. I would say we rebuilt our business beginning in kind of the '09, '10 time frame, recognizing that it's very much a specialized business. And we've built it around professional real estate bankers who are working with professional real estate developers. Generally, they are either regional or national developers. They have strong capital positions, good access to liquidity, strong track records. They're operating in some of the primary markets across the U.S. We rebuilt our business with a focus on concentration risk management. So it's well distributed portfolio is across different segments of the industry as well as across geographies. We have built a business, I think, very conservatively from a structural standpoint requiring good equity in projects. And we're constantly stressing our exposure. It's a relationship business for us. We're transacting with customers who maintain deposit relationships with us, who use our capital markets capabilities. We're very close to those customers. And as a consequence, I think we have a very good handle on the exposure that we have across the business. And we have the benefit of operating in some of the best markets in the country as well. If you look at markets like Dallas and Houston, Orlando, Charlotte, Atlanta and Nashville, where we're doing business and where the majority of our portfolio resides. We have good underpinning economy to help support the projects as well.Gerard Sean CassidyAnd maybe, David, on a technical question regarding the commercial real estate, how does the elimination of TDRs now help or hinder your guys working out with some of your customers that may inevitably have an issue with their property?David Jackson TurnerWell, we're not going to let an accounting change, change what we're going to do for our customer if we need to have a restructuring then that's what we'll do. And we'll let the accounting is what it is. So I don't think that will impact us at all, Gerard, from moving forward just like we always have.Gerard Sean CassidyVery good. And then just as a follow-up question, another technical one for you, David. Can you just remind us about the CECL being phased into capital, just the time range and how that may affect your capital ratios going forward?David Jackson TurnerIt's roughly the same number you just saw. It's almost a straight line number over, I think, it's 4 periods. So we've got 3 more of these coming. It's $100 million in round numbers in the first quarter of each of the next 3 years, about 7 points -- I'm sorry, 2 more years. And so it will be about a 7 basis point hit to us each of the next 2 years.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Peter Winter with D.A. Davidson.Peter J. WinterYou guys had pretty solid average loan growth this quarter and did maintain the period-end outlook. Can you just talk about loan demand? And then secondly, if there's any areas maybe where you're tightening underwriting standards or being more selective at this stage?John M. TurnerYes. So we -- obviously, in this economy, we want to be thoughtful about any new relationships that we acquire and any new credit that we book. I think -- I would like to think that we're not changing our underwriting standards that they are consistent across all economic cycles. But at the same time, when you think about allocation of capital and lending into this environment, we want to be thoughtful and prudent. We want to make sure that any new business we get as a result of calling activity that's been ongoing for some time. We understand the relationship potential and opportunity that we have a good plan. The bulk of the loan growth that we've experienced in the wholesale business has been loans to existing customers. And in the last quarter, a good bit of the growth was in our industry verticals, particularly in power and utilities, energy and the industrial space. We're also seeing a little growth within our Regions Business Capital business, asset-based lending business during this period of time. And then on the consumer side, mortgage grew and Interbank grew as a result of putting mortgage because we're generating some arms during the period on balance sheet arms in a period like this. I think loan growth, clearly, or loan pipelines, I should say, on the wholesale side of the business are down. And I think that reflects caution on the part of customers as well as projects, just the economy is slowing a bit as a result of rising rates and increasing cost. We still believe, given sort of our view of the future and known projects that are either underway or will get underway. There is -- we have an opportunity to grow loans, I think we're guiding to about 4% between now and end of the year and should see growth in the same categories that I just described.David Jackson TurnerI think, Peter, I'll add to that, that part of the growth outlook is because of the markets that we operate in. We've been the recipient of a lot of migration of people and businesses into where we operate. And so our economy here is a bit different than certain other economies around the country. And I think that's given us some confidence that our 4% loan growth is reasonable.Peter J. WinterGot it. Very helpful. And if I could ask about the guidance on the deposit service charges, still $550 million. Question is, how should we think about the second half of the year from the impact of that grace period? Will it step down to, I guess, around $120 million. And could you offset some of that with just account growth and cross-selling treasury management services?David Jackson TurnerYes. So you can see that our -- if you annualize where we ended up in the first quarter, we would be above the $550 million, and that's an acknowledgment that our last change of 24-hour grace actually goes in beginning of the second -- of the third quarter. And so you're going to see that step down more so in the third and fourth quarter than you have seen because we hadn't made the change. One of the things that we've been the recipients of is our treasury management investments we've made on people and technology have really helped offset to some degree, at least, the decline we're seeing from the consumer service charges, and we expect that to continue. So we're up some 8% there in TM. And if this continues at that pace, we might have a better answer for you next earnings call. But right now, we're calling for $550 million with a step down in the second half of the year.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies.Kenneth Michael UsdinI just have a follow-up also on the fee side. I know, obviously, it's been a tougher start to the year in capital markets and you're reiterating that 60 to 80 zones that you kind of were in, in the first quarter. Just maybe can you give us color on just how the business is feeling and acting in terms of pipelines and expectations and whether or not you anticipate there being a -- is there a bounce built into your expectation in the second half?John M. TurnerYes, we do -- can't expect the business to pick up in the second half of the year. It's still I would say, modestly improving, but the second quarter will probably look a lot like the first is our guess. Our business is -- a good bit of our business is built around real estate capital markets and our real estate customers, and that business has just been really, really slow. And if you look at the component parts of our business, generally speaking, whether it's syndication revenue, revenue generated from fixed income placement or derivative sales has been pretty good over the course of the first quarter. But real estate capital markets has been very soft. M&amp;A was pretty good in the first quarter. We expect that to be true through the balance of the year. So I think we're guiding to pick up in the second half of the year, and we believe that's very possible.David Jackson TurnerAnd just for clarification, make sure, Ken, that when John said you should expect the second quarter to look like the first quarter, that's ex CVA and DVA. So we're talking about the lower end of -- probably in the middle of the 60 to 80 range is about where we would expect that. And we don't expect to have a CVA DVA adjustment, quite as volatile as you just saw this quarter.Kenneth Michael UsdinAppreciate that. Yes. And second question, just on the loan side. As far as the outlook goes, when you think about just the combination of either your supply of credit and the demand of credit? And this changing environment that we're in, just what's happening on the lending side of things in terms of how the environment is changing that? Are you guys tightening up at all? Is it more about the end client that's changing their demand functions?John M. TurnerWell, naturally, in a softening economy, if you will, we are going to probably be a little more conservative, even though I would say that we like to -- as I said a few minutes ago, we like to think that our underwriting standards don't change from economic period to economic period. We are in some very good markets, as David pointed out, and while pipelines are softer, we see people that are -- still have opportunities. We want to be smart about client selectivity all the time, probably even more so during periods like this. We want to support our existing customers and some 90% -- almost 85% in round numbers of loan growth we've experienced in the last quarter was to existing customers. So we are acquiring some new customers but being very thoughtful about that. And then separately, while our economies are good, and we do see some opportunity, pipelines are down because of, I think, customer caution related to still difficulty acquiring labor. There are 2 open jobs in the Southeast for every 1 person looking for a job. So labor market is still tight. And costs while moderating have risen fairly significantly, including interest costs, obviously, which puts pressure on projects. So I think for the balance of the year, we'll probably see pipelines will have moderated and stayed fairly muted, but we believe we can deliver the loan growth that we're projecting despite that.OperatorOur next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.Betsy Lynn GraseckIn the past, you've talked a little bit about the fact that you're not going to need debt financing for, I don't know, several quarters. And I just wanted to see if you could give us an update on how you're thinking about that, especially as you -- even though your size doesn't come into the current TLAC expectations there is the potential for that to happen over time. And I wanted to hear how you're thinking about that.David Jackson TurnerYes. So from a debt financing standpoint, we borrowed a little bit from the FHLB as you saw. But the larger term financing, we said we'd push off probably until the second half of the year. We don't know what the regime is going to be, if there will be any change pushed down to us from a TLAC standpoint. At some point, whether we had that or not, we need some more term financing, some term debt that we'll put on. And so I think that we can make sure we deal with that over time. Betsy, I would say that the changes that are at least being banded around right now. You can't move too fast because we all can't go out there and raise a bunch of debt at the same time. It would be tough for the market to absorb. So I think any change that might be coming relative to that would be over time. And I still think there's going to be some tailoring what that looks like, what that means. We'll have to find out and see what our regulatory supervisors and policymakers decide. But outside of something like that, and we have a little bit of term debt that we need to get done, and that's really pointed towards the back half of this year. And that's included in our guidance.Betsy Lynn GraseckRight. And that was something that you had been talking about for a while. Just wondering if it's feasible to give us a sense as to size, if that's reasonable or not?David Jackson TurnerNo, we haven't done that yet. So we're still working out what that needs to look like and precise timing, too. But we don't expect it this first half of the year.Betsy Lynn GraseckOkay. And then separately, could you just give us a sense on the expense outlook that you've got for 2023, the kind of levers that you have to keep the expense guide in the range that you've got 4.5% to 5.5%. And if there's anything in particular that you could point us to in terms of opportunities for efficiency improvements from here.David Jackson TurnerYes, it's a great question. We tried to -- not tried, we gave guidance that our first quarter was going to be a high watermark. I'm not sure that made it into everybody's expectations, but it is what it is. We've now given you guidance again that we think the first half of the year will be higher than the second half of the year. We had some things that we knew were coming in the first half, including we moved our merit month, our merit increase up a month from April to March. So you've seen that in our first quarter. And in any event, I think when you look at the way to work on expenses. The first thing are salaries and benefits and making sure that you've got the right people, right, a number of the right people doing the right things. And I think that's always a challenge and we continue to look at process improvement, leveraging technology so that when we have attrition, natural attrition, perhaps we don't have to backfill as people if we can move that at the same time. We've looked at our occupancy. I do think return to work is still trying to find its way and but we likely have more square footage than we need, whether it be in the branch space or the office space. And so we have a team constantly working on square footage, which is our second highest cost. From a technology standpoint, we're having to make room to go through our transformation we're working on right now. And so those costs are going up, and we're able to have cuts in other places to pay for it. Vendor spend is another area where we really make sure that we limit our use of consultants or contracts with vendors. We just make sure we get the best deal we can, and we have a team working on that. So there is a cost pool in this company that's not going to go through some type of challenge during this year because you don't have a tailwind in '24 for rates. So you've got to do -- start working on your expenses today to help '24, and we're doing that. And so we have pretty good confidence in our expense number that 4.5% to 5.5% right now for this year.OperatorOur final question comes from the line of Stephen Scouten with Piper Sandler.Stephen Kendall ScoutenI just wanted to ask a little bit about the adjusted revenue guidance. Obviously, I can appreciate that would be down a little bit given the funding pressures industry-wide. But as I look at your results from this quarter, it kind of feels like they were within guidance from last quarter, and the NIM was exceptionally high. So it just feels like you might be ahead of schedule versus having to pair that guidance back. So I'm wondering if you can walk me through the main drivers of that reduction?David Jackson TurnerWell, there are 2 primary drivers. The first is we used in our guidance the March 31 forward curve that had 75 basis points worth of cuts in the year. with 1 increase. So you're down into the $450 million range by the end of the year. So we then tried to sensitize that. We told you if that wouldn't quite there, how much that may mean. And you can see that on Page 7 of the deck. So that was number one. Number two, we just had our capital markets was down quite a bit in the first quarter, primarily driven by -- or at least a good portion of it driven by the CVA/DVA adjustment. We don't think that will repeat at that level, but nonetheless, it's in the number. And so you're already down that. So we didn't carve that out as an adjusted item. That's in our core number. Some people adjust it some people don't. What we do is provide that and let you do what you want with it. But when we're giving you guidance, it is in our number -- in our core number. And so those are the 2 big drivers. We've already given you guidance that our service charge number is likely to go down because we're going to offer a 24-hour grace, and we're not exactly sure what that will mean, but we've taken an estimate, and we've given you the $550 million for service charges and we'll update as we learn. But those are probably the big 3.Stephen Kendall ScoutenOkay. Very helpful, David. And then I guess just one maybe high-level kind of question. I mean it feels like your business model is really proving itself out right now. I mean you're in just a phenomenal position from a deposit perspective and you've diversified your loan book so much over the last few years. I guess, as you look at the environment today, is there anything you would have done differently or anything you would have structured differently, knowing what, I guess, we've learned since March 8 or what have you? Or do you feel like you've done what you would have wanted to do regardless?David Jackson TurnerStephen, I think we really -- our core of our franchise are our customers and the people that work here, and we have a fabulous customer base, deposit base. We've said that for many, many years, even when rates were 0, virtually 0. And you didn't see the benefit of that rising rates and of course, having a liquidity challenges all proves the business model out. So we certainly wouldn't change that, and we wouldn't change our focus on thinking of a customer on the right side of the balance sheet in the form of a checking account or an operating account, that's really worked well for us. We brought on some really talented people in our company, in particular, in our technology area. We brought on some very good people in the revenue areas that are doing a great job for us. And so I just think sticking to fundamentals of banking is what we've done, that's what John has asked us to do. We're not trying to take big bets on anything. We're just trying to keep it down the fairway. And to me, steady as she goes, has been the way and may not be flashy, but it seems to be paying off for us. And I think if we just stay on that soundness, profitability and growth, those are the 3 words John asked us to use in that order. And if we stick to that, we're going to have a pretty good franchise. It's going to be less volatile than many of our peers and certainly less volatile than we used to be pre-crisis. So I don't see a lot of change. We need to get better and leverage technology in some areas where we're using human capital, and that's just -- that's on the to-do list, and we're trying to get after it.John M. TurnerThank you. Well, I know it's been a busy week for everybody. I appreciate your participation today, and thank you for your interest in Regions. We'll end the call. Thanks very much.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation, and have a wonderful day.]"

They just need to find what that art is.""Katrina MittenRegions Bank's Indiana Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion (DEI) Network and Eiteljorg Museum of American Indians and Western Art in Indianapolis hosted award-winning Native American artist, Katrina Mitten, for a conversation on her art, history, and culture as a citizen of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma.Regions' Diversity, Equity &amp; Inclusion (DEI) Networks represent more than 14,500 associates across 25 markets and all business groups. They are associate-led networks established geographically, whose mission is to help build deeper connections, greater understanding and a stronger sense of belonging within Regions. One way Regions' DEI Networks bring this mission to life is through interactive programming.Bill Harris, Chair of Regions' Indiana DEI Network, facilitated the event. What follows are highlights from their conversation, edited for brevity.Bill HarrisOne of the most important messages the Eiteljorg (museum) strives to convey is that Native Americans are still here. They did not vanish. Native Americans live, work, play, and create communities all across the country. You're a lifelong resident of Indiana, and a citizen of the Miami tribe of Oklahoma. Can you tell us how that works?Katrina MittenWell, when our people were removed from Indiana forcibly by the United States government and because of signing treaties, we were removed from Indiana to Oklahoma or Indian Territory, which originally Kansas was part of that, and then Oklahoma - our tribe was moved twice. But there were five families that were allowed to stay in Indiana because they had either businesses or farms already and it was negotiated during the treaty signings that those people were allowed or were able to stay here in Indiana. And my family, the Richardville ...they were allotted lands here and allowed to stay.Story continuesBill HarrisCan you tell us when you started working with art and what that means you?Katrina MittenWell, growing up here in Indiana, when children go to school, in the fourth grade they learn about Indiana history. And so, they were hearing about my family and some of it wasn't being taught like it should. It wasn't our version of the stories that came out of our history and what happened to our people. And I knew that as a young child.When I was around 12 years old, I decided I wanted to learn something. I believe I was born an artist. I think every human being is born an artist. They just need to find what that art is. ...And in my 12-year-old brain I was thinking beadwork. It was the early ‘70s so I decided to use beads, because even in the small town of Huntington where I live, there was a store where a woman had beads for sale. The love beads that were all different colored beads. I would cut them apart and I sat and I taught myself how to do loom work. But then soon after, I decided I didn't like using a loom as much. And so I moved on to looking at a couple of small pieces that my grandmother had where the beads were sewn directly onto fabric.Bill HarrisSo how do you feel like growing up in Indiana - how did that affect your art or kind of the pieces that you chose to do?Katrina MittenWell, I think that growing up in Indiana, I was away from our people because those who were allowed to stay here or were able to stay here, we were also far apart from each other. And we had to assimilate into the dominant culture. We couldn't speak our languages, we couldn't do our art, our traditional arts, because that would identify us as being native people, and we weren't treated very well. The assimilation kind of put a kink in what we could do that was traditional to our people. And so, I didn't learn from my grandmother how to do beadwork. Like I would have, you know, pre-removal.So, it was hard for me to. Especially at the age 12, the first piece I did was a very Pan Indian is what I call it. It's that style from the ‘70s and the ‘60s of Indian trinkets and the designs. It was very simple. Black thunderbird, white background with red and yellow connected diamonds. And I sewed it on the back of a fringed leather jacket.I got married, I had my children young. And so, while they were running around, you know, banging on pots and pans or watching Sesame Street, I could still sit and bead. And as I got older, we would get out to pow wows and things and we would head up north into Michigan to be around more native people and I would learn from what those people were doing also.Bill HarrisWhat do you hope to achieve through your art? What's the larger goal for you with your art?Katrina MittenThe larger goal is to get people to know and who our people are, the Miami. We had so much to do with the forming of this country. And we were a very large tribe at one time. But people don't hear of us. ...It's growing because we've worked so much on our language and other things.Bill HarrisCan you talk about what you're doing, transitioning that to the next generation?Katrina MittenI say, what's happening is that link was broken. Within our people and our culture, because of our people being removed and us assimilating that I talked about earlier, I had to teach myself. Now I'm bringing that link back together as a grandmother teaching her granddaughter to do a traditional art and that's very important for all tribes to be able to do that.The Miami people have been doing so much. We're bringing back our language - but that was almost lost. We say it was sleeping. It was just waiting for the right time to come back. Bringing those things back to our children is really important.Bill HarrisI know artists are always connected in some way to their work, but when they create something that particularly has special meaning to you, how is it hard to, you know, decide to sell it or part with it?Katrina MittenYou know, that's a really great question and I get that sort of a question all the time because when you do things with your hands, it does become a part of you. Any art that you do would be hard to give away, you know, or sell. But I look at most of my pieces, they have stories that go with them, and my goal was always to educate other people about who we are as Miami people. By those pieces selling and going to a museum or someone buying it for their home, their collection, the stories go along with it. So, they're learning, and (others) will learn from them, from that piece, also.View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Regions Bank on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Regions BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/regions-bank Email: info@3blmedia.com SOURCE: Regions BankView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/750740/Art-and-Understanding-Regions-Bank-Celebrates-Diversity-Awareness-Month]"

Investors are often tempted to pick stocks that are down and trading at a discount, but if you intend to buy and hold, you need to pick stocks geared toward growth. Buying high-quality companies is a recipe for success, and the current market situation will give you peace of mind. Many high-growth stocks to buy were routed in 2022 as the market crashed more than expected. Some stocks fell more, while many others were cut by half. However, 2023 has given an excellent start to growth stocks.Fortunately, inflation has started to cool, and we could see relief from the interest rate hikes, which means growth stocks are ready to pick up. The market hasn’t picked up the pace yet, so now is an excellent time to make your move and consider these three high-growth stocks to buy as they are poised to take off after their deep declines in 2022.VVisa$233.60ALBAlbermarle$205.27ABNBAirbnb$119.19InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsVisa (V)several Visa branded credit cardsSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.comAt the top of my list is Visa (NYSE:V), an ideal stock for unexpected times because it can benefit from the current shift in the market. The company earns revenue on its transaction volume. Thus, the underwriting bank, not Visa, handles the risk involved in credit card transactions.There is a lot to look forward to when it comes to Visa, which makes it one of the top high-growth stocks to buy. The company has recently partnered with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Venmo for its Visa+, a service that will allow money to move securely and efficiently. Users across the U.S. can start moving money between these two platforms later this year.Another reason to bet on this fintech company is its research arm, which helps address the current challenges in the industry. The company is working on developing the latest technologies, from cryptography to the blockchain and artificial intelligence. Visa is also working on digital currencies to make them more interoperable. Furthermore, Visa is expanding its presence in the creator economy through the Visa Ready Creator Commerce program, which will help connect platforms to different financial tools.Story continuesWith a rise in the adoption rate of plastic, the demand for Visa’s services will grow. Additionally, an increase in travel will benefit the company and provide a surge in cross-border transactions. Currently, V stock is trading around $234 today, up 26% in the past six months. The stock is at its 52-week high, but I believe it will hit new highs this year. Visa reports quarterly results on Apr. 25, but I think the stock is a buy before then.Albemarle (ALB)Albemarle (ALB) logo on a mobile phone screenSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.comNext is the U.S.-based company Albemarle (NYSE:ALB), a leader in domestic lithium production. Looking at the current demand for lithium, I believe ALB stock is ready to take off. That’s mainly because the company owns impressive lithium-producing assets in the United States, Australia, and Chile, with plans to add more to its Australian assets.Lithium will see a massive rise in demand over this decade, as it is a critical component used in electric vehicle manufacturing. Currently, ALB stock trades at around $205 per share today, up more than 100% over the past five years. However, it is trading much lower than its 52-week high of $334, which makes right now an ideal entry point for investors looking for a top high-growth stock to buy.The company has managed to take its revenue from $3.1 billion in 2017 to a whopping $7.3 billion in 2022. I think this is only just the start. As the demand for lithium surges over time, the company should report even more impressive top and bottom-line growth.For 2023, the company’s management team expects top-line growth to range from 55% to 75%. Looking at the company’s long-term potential, the stock looks undervalued, with considerable upside potential. Notably, ALB stock also has a dividend yield of 0.8%, making it an ideal growth stock for those seeking capital return. The company reports results on May 4, and positive results will certainly take the stock higher.Airbnb (ABNB)A close-up shot of the Airbnb (ABNB) app on a smartphone screen.Source: AngieYeoh / Shutterstock.comTravel is back! Revenge travel has made it possible for Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) to make up for everything it lost during the pandemic. The rental company struggled a lot during the pandemic, which affected its revenues greatly. However, thankfully for investors, the company roared back this year.Airbnb reported its first annual profit alongside solid quarterly numbers recently. Investors were impressed by the company’s $63.2 billion in bookings on the platform last year.Patient investors who held onto ABNB stock took home significant gains. That said, I think now is a good time to accumulate shares, for those who don’t currently have a position. That’s because I think this growth stock’s trajectory is intact, with Airbnb’s growth likely to continue through 2023. Management expects mid-double-digit revenue growth this year, while maintaining an EBITDA margin of 35%.ABNB stock is up 45% in 2023, and is currently trading around $119 today. However, the stock has immense potential to move higher in the coming months. In fact, I think this stock could re-test its 52-week high of $172 in the second half of the year. Indeed, ABNB stock is the one to own and hold for the long term.On the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This is expected to have driven top-line growth in the military end-market.Amphenol is also expected to have benefited from strong sales of automotive applications for electric and hybrid electric vehicles.Moreover, acquisitions have expanded its high technology and value-added interconnect product offering in the diversified industrial market.However, the company’s first-quarter 2023 top line is expected to have suffered from supply-chain disruptions, unfavorable forex and inflationary pressures.Story continuesWhat Our Model SaysAccording to the Zacks model, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat.

This CD has a 5.15% APY right now Buying a house? Here's how much to save This is how much money you need to earn annually to comfortably buy a $600,000 home It’s no secret that the role of the CFO has been evolving.From technology transformation to a focus on ESG reporting, many organizations are expanding the purview of CFOs. This is in addition to managing costs and profitability, investing in growth and talent, and holding people accountable. CFOs are key to driving strategies in their companies.I recently had three separate conversations with the CFOs of Citigroup, Nanotronics, and Marriott International. I asked them about how the role is evolving and a pinnacle part of the job. Here’s what they shared.Mark Mason, CFO at Citigroup:""What I love about the CFO role, in many ways, is the partner role that it plays with the business. And I've been fortunate that every CEO that I have partnered with has viewed the role as a partner, from former Citigroup CEO Mike Corbat to current CEO Jane Fraser, but also when I was a segment CFO. There are some cycles where companies have focused on, 'I want a controller type.' There are other parts of the cycle where they focused on, 'I want someone who is more of a strategic type.' And other parts of the cycle, yet still, where 'I want someone who is adept in financial management,' different from a controller or accounting policy type.""""When I think about those three types, I like to think of myself as a well-rounded CFO. I've held strategy roles. I've held finance roles. I've held CEO roles. And I think having done all of those things, makes me a more effective CFO, and a more credible CFO with my business partners because I understand how the business works. As the CFO role continues to evolve, understanding the processes that exist in a business, or exist in a function, end to end, I think is really important.""Story continuesAlice Globus, CFO at Nanotronics, a science technology company:""At Nanotronics, we're dealing with some of the most cutting-edge technology. When considering launching a new product or expanding into a new vertical, my educational background provides me with a better understanding of the potential ROI for ourselves and our customers. By speaking with customers and our R&amp;D teams, I gain insight into their challenges, and I think I have a better understanding of how I can help facilitate them to do their job better.""""I think the role of a CFO has changed pretty drastically over the past decade, and I believe it has changed even more over the past five years. You're no longer looking at just your P&amp;L and balance sheet and making decisions. They must also consider how cultural and technological influences can impact the financial decisions they make. If decisions hinder the company’s ability to improve its products, increase sales, and achieve other indicators of success, they’re actually doing a disservice.""Leeny Oberg, EVP and CFO at Marriott International:""The CFO role at Marriott has always been one that has been very much connected to the business overall. My predecessor was Carl Berquist. And his predecessor was Arne Sorenson, who's our former CFO and then CEO. He was a lawyer before he became CFO. And he was a fabulous CFO, in terms of really looking at the entire business, not just a certain aspect of it. So, I've been fortunate in that regard. The role has always been considered kind of a broad financial partner, in addition to being absolutely responsible for the controls and processes and the financial reporting, particularly of a public company.""""I kind of knew that as soon as I got to Marriott, it was going to be great to be working in a department where the CFO had that broad perspective on for helping with the strategy of the company. And marrying up this concept of the business strategies and the capital that it takes to make those strategies successful in the long term. Technology is another area of importance. The reality is that technology has only been accelerating in terms of the pace of change, which is something that the company has really needed to step up to the plate for.""Have a good weekend.

It's never easy to catch a falling knife with a significant amount of negative momentum behind it, as doing so could endanger investors who don't do the proper homework beforehand. Still, falling knives can offer rare opportunities for higher dividend yields and deeper discounts on stocks where the herd mentality has gotten it wrong.Warning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with T. Click here to check it out. High Yield Dividend Stocks in Gurus' PortfolioNYSE:VZ) and AT&amp;T (NYSE:T). They have slowly and steadily crept lower month after month. While each of these companies has its own fair share of issues, both company-specific and macro-related, I'd argue that the market is misjudging them as selling pressure continues to snowball.Betting against the herd with the out-of-favor, high-yielding blue chipsSometimes, negative momentum is enough to squeeze certain investors out of a stock, even if no material news or fundamental changes warrant such selling. That's why it's important to stay confident in your own analysis of a company. Long-term investors should not concern themselves overmuch with short-term headwinds. In fact, conventional value investing wisdom holds that short-term price headwinds may be bargain opportunities if you still believe in the company's ability to grow.I think both Verizon and AT&amp;T fall into the category of short-term declines driven mostly by macro factors and over-selling. It's understandable as both are capital-intensive stocks in a rising interest rate environment. I think we're reaching a point where selling forces are perceived as more daunting than they actually are.VerizonVerizon is a telecom titan that's continued to struggle at the hands of the softening macro environment and stiff competition. Shares of Verizon sunk 3.65% on Thursday in sympathy with AT&amp;T, which nosedived by a staggering 10.4% following a regettable quarter that saw revenue and cash flow come in short of expectations.Bargain Hunting for Dividend Investors: 2 Cheap Stocks to ConsiderVZ Data by GuruFocusVerizon has been a contrarian pick in the telecom space for quite some time. The wireless behemoth lost its market dominance and has struggled to find its way back. Those who chased the stock solely because of the high dividend yield have since been punished. Today, the stock is at risk of returning to lows not seen in over a decade.Unfortunately, Verizon may not have much going for it as it looks to turn things around. The company expects wireless revenue to grow just 1.5% this year. That's sluggish and down considerably from its fourth-quarter growth of 3.5%. The company's fixed-line business also looks to be a considerable drag on growth and margins.Simply put, there are no easy solutions for Verizon. The 6.76% dividend yield and severely depressed price-earnings ratio of 7.35 are stars of the show. With such low expectations, I think it won't be hard for the company to outperform expectations down the line.The risk/reward certainly is not bad overall in my view, even though the dividend commitment (51.1% payout ratio) is high, and the balance sheet is not as impressive as it used to be, with just $2.7 billion in cash and more than $180 billion in total debt.AT&amp;TAT&amp;T's pains grew on Thursday as the company missed analysts' estimates on revenue and free cash flow for its first quarter. Quarterly revenue came in at $30.14 billion, just a hair shy of the $30.27 billion estimate. So, why the massive plunge of more than 10%? The company noted that wireless demand and upgrades had taken a hit. As the recession develops, the company says there's a good chance that we could see demand fade further.Undoubtedly, cash-strapped consumers will need to trim away at their budgets at an increasing rate as the economy decays. However, AT&amp;T does offer an attractive 5.6% dividend yield, which may help dampen the blow of a recession until demand eventually picks back up again.The current dividend seems safe and sound. However, it's hard to say if the stock is a bargain at around $17 per share given that it's currently unprofitable. Ultimately, it depends on whether we're in for a soft or hard landing. In any case, AT&amp;T trades for a price-book ratio of 1.44, which is absurdly low, even with all macro headwinds considered. The biggest knock against the company has to be its debt load. There's a whopping $164.4 billion of total debt weighing down the balance sheet.Bottom lineThough nobody knows when the pain will end for AT&amp;T or Verizon, I find the swelling dividend yields and compressing valuation multiples on each of these stocks very compelling. Even as the average analyst calls on Wall Street hover around Hold or Sell, I view these dividend play as worthy of consideration for their long-term recovery potential.This article first appeared on GuruFocus.]"

You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their returns over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Dividend-Paying Stocks Under $50. The current inflationary environment has turned investors’ attention toward income-generating stocks as they look for regular income streams. When inflation is high, the value of money declines, and investors need to find investments that can provide returns that at least keep up with inflation. Dividend-paying stocks can be a good choice because they provide a steady stream of income that can help offset the effects of inflation. In addition to this, some companies may increase their dividends to keep up with this environment, providing even more protection against the erosion of purchasing power caused by inflation. Some of the best dividend stocks that are popular among investors include Lowe’s Companies Inc. (NYSE:LOW), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and S&amp;P Global Inc. (NYSE:SPGI).During previous inflationary periods, dividend stocks outperformed other asset classes and significantly contributed to the market’s overall returns. According to a report by Hartford Funds, dividends represented over 41% of the market’s returns since the 1940s and the percentage increased during periods when inflation was high. We also previously reported that during the decades of the 1940s and the 1970s, when inflation reached its record high, dividends accounted for 53% and 50% of the stock market’s total return, respectively.Analysts also advise investing in dividend stocks in this environment to decrease volatility and for some downside protection. John Sheehy, manager of Fidelity Equity Dividend Income Fund, spoke to Fidelity Investments about the importance of dividend investments during periods of market fluctuations. Here are some comments from the analyst:""Income from dividends is a head start in any market, which is why dividend-paying stocks have historically fared well in low-return markets and provided good downside risk protection in challenging markets such as 2022.""Story continuesHe further emphasized that investors should not focus on dividend yields when investing in dividend stocks as high yields may indicate higher payout ratios. Instead, companies with strong financials and solid balance sheets should be their choices. He said:""I look for the ability to maintain and grow dividends over time, which implies a resilient business model.""Readers can also have a look at 25 Best Stocks for Dividends to know more about dividend stocks and their importance.14 Best Dividend Paying Stocks Under $50Image by Steve Buissinne from PixabayOur Methodology:We scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds and picked 14 dividend stocks priced under $50 as of April 7.

(NYSE:LOW), AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), and S&amp;P Global Inc.

(NYSE:EPD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE:EPD) is still owned in the fund and remains one of our largest positions, as it has been since the partnership was founded. This has not been a great investment. Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.Since 2018, EPD’s dividend yield has gone from 6.5% to 8% with the annual per share payout growing from $1.72 to $1.96, +14%. The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow per share (what could be paid to us if management wanted to) has increased 22%, from $2.73 to $3.33, while leverage has come down a little over ½ a turn. So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio. We’ll continue to own this company unless the shares become meaningfully overvalued, and if it gets cheaper, we would be very comfortable owning more.”13.

The war rages on in Ukraine, and geopolitical tensions are mounting between the U.S. and China. Investors have a lot to worry about. Thankfully, with these income stocks to buy, investors can earn some serious yield while waiting for conditions to improve.One of the biggest struggles in investing is to keep emotions in check. Market volatility causes many people to make unforced errors. But by sticking to strong income stocks, a portfolio keeps generating cash regardless of what is happening in the world. This makes it easier to stay the course.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhat sorts of firms make the best sense to fill this role? These are seven of the best income stocks to buy now, and as a bonus, all offer a starting dividend yield of at least 4% at today’s prices.VZVerizon Communications$38.94DUKDuke Energy$97.41CNQCanadian Natural Resources$61.09MMM3M$106.27PSAPublic Storage$290.58SWKStanley Black &amp; Decker$80.94BCHBanco de Chile$20.46Verizon Communications (VZ)a Verizon storefront buildingSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is one of the three large American mobile telecom providers. Traditionally, investors have gravitated to these as stable blue chips that pay reliable and large dividend streams.This view came into question last year as rival AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) slashed its dividend as part of its turnaround plans. VZ stock got swept up in the general negativity around the sector.However, investors should give Verizon another look. Its earnings are quite stable; analysts expect a less than 10% decline in earnings this year, followed by a return to profit growth for Verizon in 2024. Hardly a disaster.And yet Verizon shares are off by a third from their 2021 levels. That’s an overreaction. At today’s price, Verizon trades for less than 8.5 times forward earnings and offers a 6.6% dividend yield.Story continuesDuke Energy (DUK)The logo for Duke Energy (DUK) is seen on a sign at one of the company's offices.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comDuke Energy (NYSE:DUK) is one of the country’s largest utilities. It has a sizable position in Florida, which has been a fast-growing market which has delivered attractive returns on capital for local power generation firms.Florida also has offered excellent opportunities for Duke to deploy solar power generation at scale.The company is aiming to put $65 billion to work through 2027, with a ton of that going into clean energy. The way regulated utilities work, firms earn a fixed return on investment on these plans, giving Duke a clear runway for earnings and dividend growth in coming years.DUK stock has sold off 15% over the past year amid concerns around higher interest rates. This offers income investors an opportunity as Duke’s dividend yield has crept up to 4.1%.Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockCanadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) is one of Canada’s largest energy companies. Over the decades, it has built up its business primarily on the strength of the Alberta oil sands.When other players have wanted to exit that field, such as Devon (NYSE:DVN) a few years ago, Canadian Natural bought their assets at bargain prices.The oil sands are proving to be invaluable today. That’s because oil sands production functions more like traditional mining rather than an oil well.This means that oil sands have a far more predictable and stable production level than something like fracking, where production levels plunge over time. By contrast, analysts expect oil sands production, to continue rising well into the 2030s.This steady production function is essential now because there is so much opposition to new oil and gas drilling.With politicians, environmentalists, and ESG-driven investors all against new oil drilling, it’s increasingly difficult to bring new oil production to market. This gives a firm like Canadian Natural — whose assets can produce out into the 2050s — a tremendous position.Canadian Natural is also highly profitable; CNQ stock goes for just 9 times earnings. In addition to the dividend, the company is buying back huge piles of its own stock.With the price of oil on an upswing and the long-term supply picture looking uncertain, Canadian Natural’s large and long-lasting reserves should generate huge amounts of income for investors in the coming years.3M (MMM)3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stockSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com3M (NYSE:MMM) is an American manufacturing powerhouse. The firm has more than 90,000 employees and produces thousands of unique products across a dizzying area of fields ranging from safety helmets to automotive repair tools, dental equipment, adhesives, and dozens of others.In recent years, MMM stock has fallen sharply. Various factors have accounted for this including slow organic growth, product liability lawsuits, and concerns around the health of the overall economy.However, the sell-off has gone much too far. Shares now sell for just 12 times forward earnings and offer a nearly 6% dividend yield.That’s a great offer for such a blue chip American industrial giant as this one. 3M is also spinning off its healthcare business later this year which could be a catalyst for helping realize shareholder value.Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comThe self-storage industry has traditionally been one of the best categories in terms of total returns within the real estate investment trust (REITs) category.A big part of this is because storage is a recession-resistant category. People need a place to store their stuff regardless of what the economy is doing.In fact, recessions have a way of causing people to change their living conditions, which can drive incremental demand for additional storage capacity. While foreclosures and downsizing are bad news for most real estate, it isn’t anything for a storage investor to fear.Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) has been a tremendous performer over the decades. PSA stock has risen from $13 in 1993 to nearly $300 today, and that doesn’t even count the dividends.Public Storage is the industry leader, and it is currently on the hunt for more acquisitions which will further entrench its position.Shares have fallen recently around concerns around higher interest rates, but that’s nothing for long-term investors to worry about. Meanwhile, with the decline in the share price, PSA stock now yields 4.1%.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)Stanley Black and Decker (SWK) is a manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and provider of security productsSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.comStanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) is a leading maker of power tools and appliances. The company, like many, got caught up in the pandemic-driven boom/bust cycle.SWK stock soared in 2021 amid a surge in demand. People were doing home maintenance and repair projects at a record rate and bought Stanley Black &amp; Decker tools to aid those endeavors.Since then, however, demand has cooled. And since power tools are durable goods, many people that bought products in 2020 or 2021 won’t need any more Stanley Black &amp; Decker equipment for a while. Sales went from record highs to well below trend now.However, the market has punished SWK stock far too harshly, with shares trading down 50% from where they were prior to the onset of the pandemic. This is a wild move for a firm that has such a storied track record of earnings and dividend growth. On that latter point, Stanley Black &amp; Decker has increased its dividend for a stunning 55 years in a row, and shares now yield 4%.Banco de Chile (BCH)Piggy bank on a wooden table with stacks of coins next to it.Source: FabrikaSimf / ShutterstockBanco de Chile (NYSE:BCH) is the largest bank in Chile by market share. The case for owning Chilean banks is two-fold.One, Chile will become a central hub of the green revolution. Chile has among the world’s largest untapped reserves of both copper and lithium. To electrify cars and build batteries at scale, we’ll need far more of both materials. This should set off an 1849-style mining boom in Chile as it steps up to fill the need for these materials to power the green revolution.The second factor is that Latin American banks, including Banco de Chile, tend to earn far higher profit margins than U.S. banks. This is thanks to multiple reasons including less competition, higher market share, and lower compensation to employees as a proportion of revenues.BCH stock is still selling at a rock bottom valuation of just 5 times forward earnings while offering a juicy 11% dividend yield. Investors are understandably irritated with Chilean assets thanks to the limited economic growth over the past decade. But with the race for copper and lithium heating up, Chile is set to have a notable economic expansion, and its largest bank is set to profit.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in BCH, VZ, CNQ, MMM, SWK stock.

242,a63afefc-508b-3e0c-8ca2-92e73dc686b7,NVDA,2023-04-22,Top 15 Cloud Computing Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-15-cloud-computing-companies-202451124.html,1682108691,STORY,"['AMZN', 'CRM', 'DBX', 'NVDA', 'WDAY', 'IOT', 'IBM', 'NOW', 'SPLK', 'ADSK', 'VMW', 'VEEV', 'ADP', 'TEAM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the top 15 cloud computing companies in the world. For more companies head on over to Top 5 Cloud Computing Companies in the World. The growth of technology has created new markets and changed the manner in which people live their lives and businesses run their operations. While the computer and the microprocessor on their own have enabled users to compute billions of instructions in the blink of an eye, the true disruption from technology takes place in tandem with the rise of the Internet. Data from the popular internet speed testing firm Ookla, global internet speeds have grown from 0.5 megabits per second (Mbps) to 107 Mbps as of July 2021.This high speed connectivity has generated growth in a relatively nascent industry called cloud computing. The Internet's role in cloud computing growth is clear from the fact that these technologies have been present since the 1970s when computers were first linked together to allow for resource sharing. This also led to a growth in enterprise resource computing and firms such as SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) which enable companies to manage their production and other resources efficiently. However, things only took a head at the turn of the millennia, with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) allowing its customers to 'rent out' cloud computing resources and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) delivering software over the Internet. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) joined in soon as it provided a system for developers to develop applications over the Internet, and even the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) pitched in by providing the world's first open source software for creating private and semi private cloud computing networks.These days, cloud computing is used far and wide in both the enterprise sector and by the general consumer. One of the most well known examples of cloud computing is Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX)'s online platform that enables users to remotely share their documents and other resources. While on the surface Dropbox being a cloud computing firm might sound counterintuitive due to the term 'computing', in fact, cloud computing is defined by three distinct yet interrelated services. These are platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). Out of these, Dropbox is a SaaS company since it provides people with access to a virtual platform located on its hardware through an easily accessible interface.Story continuesOn the corporate side of things, cloud computing is quite prevalent as well. These uses are spread across a variety of industries, from sectors ranging from hospitality and restaurants to biotechnology, banking, and production and logistics optimization. According to the consulting firm McKinsey, the coronavirus pandemic was a massive stimulant for the cloud computing sector. It outlines that prior to the devastating global pandemic, companies planned to spend less than half of their information technology budgets on cloud computing by 2021. However, the pandemic led to this spending growing to 80% of the budget by 2024. A large motivating factor behind this spending is the cost benefits offered by cloud computing, as according to McKinsey, the segment can generate an additional $1 trillion in operating income. For the uninitiated, operating income is the income of a firm after direct and indirect costs are accounted for but taxes and interest payments are not subtracted. On a side note, cloud computing was also central in Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s fight against the coronavirus, as the firm built its messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) research platform on a public cloud, which enabled it to scale up research of, and rapidly design, the Spikevax coronavirus vaccine.As a whole, the global cloud computing market was worth $484 billion in 2022 and should grow to $619 billion by the end of this year according to a report from Grand View Research. From then until 2030, the sector is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1% and sit at a final value of $1.5 trillion by the end of the forecast period.Looking at the situation on the ground, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s chief financial officer Mr. Brian Olsavsky commented on the firm's AWS cloud computing division during Amazon's Q4 2022 earnings call conference where he highlighted:Net sales increased $21.4 billion in Q4, up 20% year-over-year and now representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Starting back in the middle of the third quarter of 2022, we saw our year-over-year growth rates slow as enterprises of all sizes evaluated ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to the tough macroeconomic conditions.As expected, these optimization efforts continued into the fourth quarter. Some of the key benefits of being in the cloud compared to managing your own data center are the ability to handle large demand swings and to optimize costs relatively quickly, especially during times of economic uncertainty. Our customers are looking for ways to save money, and we spend a lot of our time trying to help them do so. This customer focus is in our DNA and informs how we think about our customer relationships and how we will partner with them for the long term. As we look ahead, we expect these optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters. So far in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-teens.That said, stepping back, our new customer pipeline remains healthy and robust, and there are many customers continuing to put plans in place to migrate to the cloud and commit to AWS over the long term.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the top cloud computing companies in the world, with the top ones being Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL).Top 15 Cloud Computing Companies in the WorldAI Generated ImageOur Methodology To find the top cloud computing companies in the world, we started by listing down all publicly traded firms that provide cloud computing products and services.

For more stocks, head on over to 5 Stocks that will 10x in 5 Years According to the Media. Investing in the stock market can very well be described as reading a crystal ball. After all, profit or gains are the primary motives anyone ever buys shares, and the crystal ball consists of a variety of factors including the firm's positioning in its market, the market size, a potential early mover advantage, growths for the market, financial fundamentals, and management strength among some of the few factors that most folks analyze before making an investing decision.For the uninitiated, these factors can feel overwhelming at times. However, get them right then all you have to do is to sit back and enjoy the returns. And in some cases the returns are massive. Stocks that return more than 100% are called multi baggers, and you might be surprised to know that there are dozens of them on the market. Our coverage, 12 Best Multibagger Stocks to Buy Now, list down exactly a dozen of these companies. Out of the top twelve, the top three stocks that gained more than 300% in returns at the time of publishing are  Nine Energy Service, Inc. (NYSE:NINE),  Target Hospitality Corp. (NASDAQ:TH), and Scorpio Tankers Inc. (NYSE:STNG), which gained 642%, 372%, an 334% during the twelve month period that ended on December 13, 2022. Where are these companies now? Well, Nine Energy, a popular Wall Street Bets stock, lost most of its gains this year, Target Hospitality is down 14% year to date, but Scorpio Tankers has gained an additional 5% over the course of 2023's first four months. On the surface, this might make you scratch your head and think that perhaps multi bagger stocks are nothing but huff and puff. But look a little deeper and you'll realize that had you timed your bets at the right time and then cashed out right at the top, you'd have made massive returns before the shares dropped.Story continuesAnother cool set of stocks that excites investors is ten bagger stocks. Think a stock returning more than 100% is stunning? Well, there's an entire category of stocks called ten baggers, which refers to shares that appreciate one thousand percent! Sounds a bit like a fairy tale, doesn't it? After all, if there was a surefire way of turning your dollar into $1,000 then everybody would be rushing to these companies too. However, once again, we've got a surprise for you as there are several ten bagger stocks out there as well. But these gains have a long time period, as typically if a firm's shares have gained 1,000% in just a year then you have more reasons to be suspicious than to be excited.So, the next question to ask is what are these ten baggers, and which firms have seen these returns on the stock market? Well, the first stock is everyone's favorite, the Cupertino, California consumer technology giant Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Since 2013, Apple's shares have jumped by more than 10.5x, from an approximate trading value of $14 in late April to today's $161 per share. Another firm whose shares have grown by more than 10x is Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). Netflix's shares were trading at approximately $23 in April 2023, with the current share price of $334 making the gains clear as daylight. Others that have bested the market and posted even stronger returns are Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).After identifying a handful of ten baggers, one has to wonder what are the secrets to their success. Well, for that you'd have to jump right to the top of our list and see some of the factors we believe make for strong stock picking. Out of these, Apple, Netflix, NVIDIA, and AMD were all favorably positioned in their markets. AMD is among the handful of firms that has a license to make and sell x86 microprocessors, which are the backbone of modern day computing. NVIDIA is among the earliest movers in accelerated computing and artificial intelligence. Netflix developed an online streaming platform before all others, and Apple was the first to introduce user friendly yet technologically complex gadgets.NVIDIA's founder and chief executive officer Mr. Jen-Hsun Huang revealed the secrets of his success in an interview given to CNBC in March 2023, where he highlighted some crucial bets that the company made before all others and outlined:But the part that was really wonderful was when we realized that Alexnet is not just some neural network, but it's a whole new way of doing software. Alexnet is profound in that way. Not only was it a giant breakthrough in computer vision, it was also a profoundly new way of doing software. Some people call it software 2.0, where the machine augments the software programmers, and the data writes the software. Instead of humans typing in a software program, the data creates the software.That way of using experience or data to cause a software to be able to make future predictions was so profound, and we had the good wisdom to put the whole company behind it. We saw early on, about a decade or so ago, that this way of doing software could change everything. All of the software that we wanted to write that we didn't know how to write, we could now do. And that was a great decision, and we changed the company from the bottom to all the way to the top and sideways. Every chip that we made was focused on artificial intelligence. We built a wonderful research organization dedicated to artificial intelligence. Our entire software stack was invented for AI.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some stocks that can grow by 10x in the next five years, with some top picks being SoFi Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SOFI), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Desktop Metal, Inc. (NYSE:DM).15 Stocks that will 10x in 5 Years According to the MediaPhoto by Sharon McCutcheon on UnsplashOur Methodology We cast a wide net for our hunt for stocks that can grow 10x in five and ten years. As part of our research, we consulted 11 different financial media outlets (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11). This enabled us to identify 46 different firms that the media believes can grow by 10x in ten years. Then, initial preference was given to stocks that appear on multiple lists and on lists that indicate growth in five years. After this, those that do not appear on more than one list were ranked through share price upside. In our final compilation, the latter group is listed first as part of fifteen stocks that can grow 10x in five years, and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is the only company that appears on lists for both five and ten years.15 Stocks that will 10x in 5 years According to the Media15. Nextdoor Holdings, Inc.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Stocks Jim Cramer and Hedge Funds Have in Common.""These Uninformed Sellers, They Make Way For The Well Informed Buyers""On April 20, Jim Cramer weighed in on the recent market volatility we have been experiencing. Cramer has spotted a pattern that the market has been exhibiting recently and noted that while the market opens low, it recovers throughout the day as ""buyers come in and scoop up stocks"". According to Cramer, ""uninformed sellers make way for the well informed buyers"".Cramer attributes the morning weakness of the market to a variety of factors, firstly negative news from Europe. Cramer noted that currently, Europe is not performing well in comparison to the United States since inflation is still running high in the region and that is calling for higher interest rates from the ECB.Another reason that is currently causing market volatility, according to Jim Cramer, is negative macroeconomic speculation. Cramer noted that before the opening bell, economists and strategists speculate negatively about rate hikes from the Fed and this results in the market opening low.Thirdly, Cramer thinks that geopolitical tensions are another major factor contributing to the morning weakness of the markets. Here is what he said:""Hardly a day goes by without a negative story on one of these fronts. Overnight, nothing good is ever gonna happen in China right. Then you gotta pray their government doesn't make any comments about the need to retake Taiwan. You won't hear anything particularly good about Ukraine either, and you certainly can't expect anything good to come out of Washington, especially when it comes to debt ceiling negotiations.""Finally, the Mad Money host talked about ""a negative bias"" that results from analyst downgrades, and results in short sellers making ""stocks look real ugly"". Cramer noted that short sellers engage in aggressive short selling and this causes investors to panic and exit their positions as well. However, short sellers create opportunities for ""people who do their homework"". Cramer noted that intelligent investors allow for ""this big batch of sellers to give them better prices"" and then they buy and take stocks higher.Story continuesTo conclude, Cramer thinks that ""well informed buyers"" can profit in the current market. He simplified the behavior of the market by explaining how we have ""a negative bias every morning emanating from Europe, coupled with a gloomy group of money managers who simply don't believe that bear market has ended"". In such an environment, Cramer has become increasingly selective about stocks. We have compiled a list of 10 stocks that Jim Cramer and hedge funds have in common, so our readers can gain further insights into what kind of companies they should consider positioning in given the turbulent market situation.

Despite volatility and a mid-December decline, most equity markets finished higher in the quarter, and BlackRock, which is heavily tied to these markets, benefited. Additionally, investors are anticipating that the company’s fixed income products will experience growth in 2023. Alternative strategies are expanding as well and should continue to provide a profitable revenue stream.”9. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Cramer's charitable trust owns Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). The Mad Money journalist recently broke down the company's earnings and said that though the company reported higher than expected loan losses and ""disappointing"" investment banking line items, an important metric to consider for Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is ""net new assets because these guys are increasingly in the asset management business"".

The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins.

Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”Some of Jim Cramer's top stock picks right now include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).7. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of Cramer's ""favorites for all of 2023"". He mentioned the stock among ""great American companies with beaten down stocks"". Though costs for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) have been coming down, the stock has been beaten down to a point where it may be ""too cheap"". Cramer thinks The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is ""the king of consumer products goods"" and he sees material upside to the stock. As of April 20, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has gained 17.32% over the past 6 months.The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was held by 74 hedge funds at the close of Q4 2022.

The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is placed ninth on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer and hedge funds have in common.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Jim Cramer has mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) multiple times in recent days and has been bullish on the stock. Most recently, Cramer spoke about how sentiment around The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) has been negative, but the company disproved the bears after releasing earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2023. Cramer said ""this may be the worst time to invest. But when a good company can see its stock fall by 30%, when there was nothing really wrong, worst time to invest, but invest"". Shares of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) have gone down by 34%, as of April 20, and the stock is trading at a PE multiple of 14x.On April 17, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) announced earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The company generated a revenue of $5.12 billion, up 9.50% year over year, and reported an EPS of $0.93, ahead of EPS estimates by $0.03. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is one of Jim Cramer's top stock picks that are popular among elite hedge funds.At the close of the fourth quarter of 2022, 74 hedge funds were eager on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) and held collective positions worth $8.1 billion in the company. Of those, GQG Partners was the most prominent shareholder and held a stake worth $1.4 billion.Madison Investments made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We bought shares in The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) as they declined meaningfully in March. Schwab is the premier asset-gathering franchise in the brokerage industry, with particular strength in the advisory market. As one of the top two players in the retail side of the market, it has the scale economies to be a low-cost provider and compete with newcomers intent on industry disruption. In the advisory segment, where it serves independent advisors, it delivers the gold standard in service and product breadth. We believe its moat is wide, and it should grow at a healthy pace for the foreseeable future.As part of its brokerage model, Schwab operates a meaningfully sized bank, where its brokerage clients maintain deposits as part of their cash management. With over $300 billion in deposits and $500 billion in assets, if it were an independent bank, it would be one of the largest in the country. As interest rates have risen, many clients have been moving cash from low-yield bank accounts to higher-yielding alternatives, such as money-market funds. The industry calls this process cash “sorting.” For Schwab, cash sorting began about 18 months ago, and a large part of its recent stock price drop can be attributed to investor concerns that this process may accelerate. The difference for Schwab, compared to all other banks, is that when depositors pull money out, they are mostly just moving it over to other parts of Schwab! Thus, unlike traditional banks, Schwab doesn’t lose assets in the sorting dynamic. In fact, like U.S. Bancorp, Schwab appears to be a net beneficiary from the recent mini-panic in that new asset inflows have picked up as individuals flee to safety.This dynamic does cause some disruption at the bank entity, though, as client cash remains within Schwab’s total but is no longer available as deposits to fund the bank’s securities portfolio. We think Schwab has more than sufficient liquidity to deal with this. The realistic worst-case outcome is that total earnings are moderately suppressed for a period as funding costs go up, and Schwab earns less profit for every dollar invested in deposit alternatives, as compared to what it earns per dollar deposited in the bank. Despite this headwind, we believe that as long as Schwab can grow total investment assets under its umbrella over time, its earning power should also grow.”In addition to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), other stocks that both Jim Cramer and hedge funds have in common include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Meta Platforms, Inc.

Now, the US, last year, had announced that it was imposing some restrictions on exports into China of certain chips, and also manufacturing tools for those chips. But that involves the more advanced chips. So you still see chips that are going into the EV vehicles, for example. The demand for those are growing in China.And those are the types of chips that we're talking about when it comes to the Chinese customers for ASML and for LAM. When it comes to that strong demand that they are seeing, that will continue out of China. So LAM and ASML say that these Chinese customers are buying tools for building the less advanced chips, those chips that go into EVs, those chips that go into mobile phones that also go into laptops.And this is all happening really when you are seeing each region of the world or the major regions of the world, trying to become more self-sufficient when it comes to making chips because of the supply chain issues that we saw during the pandemic and also because of security concerns as well.Story continuesSo Europe just approved an EU Chips Act that's aimed at building capacity for building chips in and out of the EU, also making the EU just basically more self-sufficient in trying to avoid those supply chain issues that I just mentioned. As far as where the chip sector is going, analysts are seeing a recovery in the second half of 2023 after an inventory digestion. And you just had a Jefferies analyst that have a buy rating on LAM saying, investors are underestimating the potential for a v-shaped recovery, which is often what happens after a material inventory correction, Rochelle.- And then also honing in on TSMC, what do their latest results say about the chip space?INES FERRE: Yeah, basically, what they are-- they revised down their full year sales outlook, so they're expecting their revenue to be a little bit lower. But nevertheless, their CapEx is remaining unchanged. That's a capital expenditure. And so that bodes well for the equipment makers of the chip makers.So when you're taking a look at the overall sort of health of the industry, they do see that a stronger second half of the year, which kind of jives with what analysts are also saying. They're seeing a second stronger half for the year or so. They're expecting even stronger 2024, Rochelle.- Well, thank you for getting us up to speed on that. Our very own, Ines Ferre.]"

Small caps have garnered attention due to their relative weakness. The demise of Silicon Valley Bank has thrown doubt at many stocks. Conversely, big-cap tech has made an impact for the opposite reason. QQQ is up nearly 20% while underlying components such as Nvidia are higher by a whopping 91% or more.One common phenomenon in the stock market is industry group rotation, which refers to the shifting of investor preferences from one industry to another. Though the trends mentioned above show little signs of slowing, they will eventually diverge from the trend and other industries will take the limelight. Investors should be prepared should that happen. Even if it does not happen right away, it also makes sense to diversify. Today we will discuss 3 industries (and stocks within them) worth watching:Solar EnergyThe clean energy sector has been on a growth trajectory for years as geopolitical conflicts have disrupted the supply of fossil fuels, world governments push for clean energy agendas, and solar technology improves and becomes more efficient. Investors should stick to the group's leading stock which is Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) stock First Solar. FSLR is currently set up in a good-looking base structure ahead of its earnings which are due April 27th.Medical ProductsThe medical products industry often flies under the radar. However, the group has some attractive characteristics that make it worth investing in. Generally, companies within this group tend to be recession-proof, stable, and offer long-term growth. Wednesday, surgical robotics maker Intuitive Surgical injected life into the industry after it beat earnings expectations. The stock shot higher by more than 10% in the session on expanding volume.Story continuesThough the stock is extended in price at this juncture, investors may want to turn their attention to glucose monitoring system maker Dexcom.DXCM is breaking out of a multi-month base ahead of its April 27th EPS report.Enterprise SoftwareIt's easy to see why the Internet-Software group is a top 25% group. Whenever I see multiple stocks in an industry breaking out simultaneously, my eyes light up. It is difficult to find an industry with more momentum than the enterprise software group. Enterprise software companies like Asure Software broke out last week and are up 15% since.Bottom LineMarkets have been known to have periods of ""nasty"" industry group rotations, catching investors off guard. Investors should look at the three under-the-radar groups above as ways of diversifying into other parts of the market.Why Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks? Since 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&amp;P's +6.2 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +46.4%, +49.5% and +55.2% per year.

You can skip our detailed analysis of the pharmaceutical sector and its outlook this year, and go directly to read 5 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2023. The pharmaceutical industry in the US is one of the largest in the world, representing roughly 50% of the global pharmaceutical sales revenue, as of 2020. The industry consists of a wide range of players, including large multinational corporations, mid-sized and small companies, and biotech startups. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry, as some companies dealing in vaccines or treatments for the virus experienced increased demand for their products. The trend of spending on Covid-related drugs continued through 2022. Some of the biggest pharma companies, like Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (NASDAQ:GILD), and Merck &amp; Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), among others, are estimated to have generated approximately $100 billion in revenues in 2022, according to a report by Reuters.The current inflationary period has brought defensive stocks into the limelight as these stocks do not get affected by economic cycles. Pharmaceutical companies are often considered to be defensive as they deal in products that are considered essential for the maintenance of health and the treatment of illnesses, and demand for these products may remain relatively stable even during a recession. The sector also delivered positive returns to shareholders last year, when the S&amp;P 500 recorded its worst annual performance since 2008. The NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index gained 4.91% from December 2021 to December 2022, compared with a 19.4% decline in the S&amp;P 500 during the same period. The index returned 3.71% in the past 12 months.Though pharma stocks delivered solid returns in 2022, the sector had a comparatively slow year pertaining to merger and acquisition (M&amp;A) deals compared with the previous years. One of the main reasons for this slowdown was that drugmakers acquired companies with authorized and tested drugs and products, instead of companies with products in clinical trials. Moreover, the economic headwinds from inflation and higher interest rates also hindered the deals last year. The deal value in the biopharma sector fell 42% in 2022, compared with 2021, as reported by Ernst &amp; Young. It was not the case in the past as large-cap pharma companies closed 178 deals from 2016 to 2020 with a total value of over $452.3 billion. However, analysts are positive about the activity gaining momentum this year. PwC expects the total M&amp;A deals to value between $225 billion and $275 billion across all sectors in 2023. Readers can also have a look at 25 Biggest Pharmaceutical Companies in the World to know more about the sector’s outlook.Story continues12 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2023Pressmaster/Shutterstock.comOur Methodology:We scanned Insider Monkey's database of 943 hedge funds as of Q4 2022 and selected dividend companies from the pharma industry that are involved in the research, development, manufacturing, and marketing of drugs and other medical treatments.

We are simply betting that the future might not be as bad as the price suggests.”Consensus FY22 and FY23 EPS estimates at the time were around $17 – $18 per share.

The stock trades at a low valuation relative to its current earnings because the company faces loss of exclusivity on several key drugs over the next eight years, including Revlimid, Eliquis, and Opdivo. At the same time, Bristol-Myers has multiple new products in the early stages of launch (e.g., Opdualag, Camzyos, Breyanzi, and Reblozyl), a robust new product pipeline (e.g., Deucravacitinib, Milvexian, and CELMoD agents), and a strong balance sheet combined with strong free cash flow generation that the company can use for acquisitions. Management believes these growth drivers can more than offset the loss of exclusivity and drive revenue growth through the end of the decade. Given the company’s low valuation, if the company can execute, we think there is substantial upside in the stock.”6. CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 70 CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) is an American healthcare company that owns a range of retail pharmacy chains.

Vltava Fund mentioned CVS Health Corporation (NYSE:CVS) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“CVS is a leader in the provision of healthcare services in the USA. It has three main businesses: an enormous network of pharmacies, a health insurance company, and “prescription benefit management”, which is a kind of intermediary between insurance companies and pharmacies. This is the result of large acquisitions over the past 15 years – most notably of Caremark (2007) and Aetna (2018). The markets had deemed its acquisition of health insurer Aetna too expensive (and we agree), so CVS stock then fell into disfavour for a few years. We took advantage of this in the summer of 2020 and brought the stock into our portfolio at a time when its price was pressed down still further by the coronavirus pandemic. CVS is a giant. It has revenues of USD 300 billion, making it one of the largest companies in the world. It is a relatively stable and highly profitable company with strong free cash flow. Over the past few years, CVS has focused primarily on reducing debt. This is already much lower than it had been after the Aetna acquisition, and most of the cash is now likely to go to shareholders through share buybacks or be used for smaller acquisitions to grow the company further. CVS trades at about 11 times annual earnings, which is a very appealing valuation given the expected future growth in profitability and overall modest cyclicality in its business.”Click to continue reading and see 5 Best Pharma Dividend Stocks To Buy in 2023. Suggested articles:10 Best FAANG Stocks To Buy Now10 Best Telecom Dividend Stocks To Buy for 202310 Undervalued Lithium Stocks to Buy NowDisclosure.

In the last reported quarter, the company delivered an earnings surprise of 27.34%. WST’s earnings beat estimates in three of the trailing four quarters and missed the same in one, the average surprise being 10.35%.Q1 EstimatesCurrently, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues is pegged at $697.3 million, indicating a decline of 3.2% from the year-ago period. The same for earnings stands at $1.65 per share, indicating a 28.3% deterioration from the prior-year quarter.Factors to NoteWest Pharmaceutical’s Proprietary Products was an important contributor to the company’s top-line growth in the fourth quarter of 2022. The segment is likely to have exhibited sustained strength in the first quarter as well.Apart from this, the company is also expected to have witnessed margin expansion in the aforementioned segment. This is due to a favorable mix of products sold (stemming from high-value products’ [HVP] demand), production efficiencies and higher sales price.WST has been witnessing a strong uptake of HVP components, which include Westar and NovaPure offerings. This trend is likely to have continued in the quarter to be reported. However, delays in expansion projects, customer delivery timing and mix-shift-related productivity impacts might have hurt HVP’s sales growth.West Pharmaceutical has been making significant efforts to retain customers’ faith amid the uncertainty triggered by COVID-19. Apart from ensuring the safety and well-being of team members worldwide, it has successfully continued the manufacturing and supply of products to its customers. These initiatives might have favored the company’s first-quarter performance.Although the top line declined during the fourth quarter, demand growth and a strong order book for 2023 are encouraging. The company’s better-than-expected revenue outlook is likely to get reflected in the first-quarter results.Story continuesWest Pharmaceutical Services, Inc.

That company out with earnings as well today. And Travelers, a provider of property and casualty insurance, its earnings beat in its latest quarter. Core and net income did fall, as the company navigated impacts from a higher level of severe weather across the United States. But you can see overall, beating by a pretty good margin there, even as net income fell.So interesting there. We also talked about the company doing a $5 billion share buyback authorization. As we always like to note, that doesn't mean they're actually going to buy back all of those shares. But the board has authorized that move over time.BRAD SMITH: Yeah. And in the past few weeks, with some of the weather events that we've had as well, it's been interesting to see where the premiums-- the record net written premiums that they had is noteworthy to call out here. Record of $9.396 billion there. So yeah, $9.4 billion rounded off. But that's up by about 12%. You compare that to the prior year's quarter, with growth in all three segments they're noting.And so could be something that a lot of homeowners, a lot of people who were just looking for insurance of actually any kind, they, especially in these different weather patterns or more inclement weather events, or perhaps looking to re-up some of the insurance policies that they do have, and Travelers could be a beneficiary on that front too.JULIE HYMAN: Yeah. It is interesting to see the net investment income go up as well in this environment. We did see, to go back to Morgan Stanley for just a second, their fixed income trading revenue beat estimates. So we don't know exactly. We'd have to listen to the call for Travelers to find out where perhaps that investment was. But interesting to see that number go higher.]"

Firstly, we'll want to see a proven return on capital employed (ROCE) that is increasing, and secondly, an expanding base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So, when we ran our eye over Air Products and Chemicals' (NYSE:APD) trend of ROCE, we liked what we saw.What Is Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)?For those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. The formula for this calculation on Air Products and Chemicals is:Return on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)0.10 = US$2.6b ÷ (US$28b - US$3.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).So, Air Products and Chemicals has an ROCE of 10%.  That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 11% generated by the Chemicals industry. See our latest analysis for Air Products and Chemicals roceIn the above chart we have measured Air Products and Chemicals' prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free report for Air Products and Chemicals.So How Is Air Products and Chemicals' ROCE Trending?While the current returns on capital are decent, they haven't changed much. The company has consistently earned 10% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 53% in that time. Since 10% is a moderate ROCE though, it's good to see a business can continue to reinvest at these decent rates of return. Over long periods of time, returns like these might not be too exciting, but with consistency they can pay off in terms of share price returns.Story continuesThe Key TakeawayTo sum it up, Air Products and Chemicals has simply been reinvesting capital steadily, at those decent rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.Air Products and Chemicals does have some risks though, and we've spotted   1 warning sign for Air Products and Chemicals  that you might be interested in.For those who like to invest in solid companies, check out this free list of companies with solid balance sheets and high returns on equity.Have feedback on this article?

254,46247350-d39f-3fe0-8f6d-e581593af4e7,FOX,2023-04-22,Column: We've solved the mystery of Smartmatic’s funding in $2.7 bln Fox case,Reuters,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/column-weve-solved-mystery-smartmatic-202055303.html,1682108455,STORY,['FOXA'],"[By Alison Frankel(Reuters) - (The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) The voting technology company Smartmatic USA Corp is up against a phalanx of Fox lawyers in its $2.7 billion defamation suit over debunked election fraud claims.Fox News Network LLC and Fox Corp are shelling out for the services of at least three law firms, including top appellate counsel from Clement &amp; Murphy and a vast team from Kirkland &amp; Ellis, one of the biggest and most expensive law firms in the country.How is Smartmatic — the David to Fox's Goliath in this case — coming up with the money to litigate against Fox’s high-priced onslaught?Fox has long suspected that Smartmatic was receiving funding from an outside source. Its lawyers have repeatedly argued in filings to New York State Supreme Court Justice David Cohen that Smartmatic has no money to spare, citing a report from its expert economist that the voting tech company lost $100 million between 2016 and 2020 and hasn’t turned a profit in years. (Smartmatic refutes that contention, insisting that Fox’s false reporting squelched its billion-dollar prospects.)Fox litigated for more than a year to find out who is funding Smartmatic’s case, arguing that the funder’s motives were relevant to its counterclaim accusing the election tech company of filing a baseless lawsuit. As I’ll explain, Fox won that fight: Cohen ruled last month that Smartmatic has to disclose any agreement to pay its litigation costs and expenses.But it turns out that Fox was apparently wrong all along about Smartmatic’s funding: No outsider is paying Smartmatic’s litigation costs, according to Smartmatic counsel Erik Connolly of Benesch, Friedlander, Coplan &amp; Aronoff.“Smartmatic does not have any third-party funding for the cases, and never has had such funding,” Connolly said in an email statement to me.He and a Smartmatic spokesperson did not respond to my follow-up question about whether Benesch Friedlander is handling the case on a contingency fee basis, in which the law firm fronts the cost of litigation in exchange for a percentage of the client’s ultimate recovery. As my Reuters colleague Andrew Goudsward reported earlier this week, Dominion’s lead counsel in its parallel defamation suit against Fox, Susman Godfrey, handled Dominion’s case on a discounted contingency fee basis, which means the law firm should have quite a payday thanks to Dominion’s $787.5 million settlement with Fox.Story continuesI’m not sure why Smartmatic fought so hard against Fox’s demand for disclosure of a funding agreement that, according to the company’s new statement to me, does not even exist. But I’m sure Smartmatic and its lawyers had a bit of a laugh along the way at what now seems to have been a wild goose chase by Fox.Spokespeople for Fox News and Fox Corp did not respond to my email query about Smartmatic’s denial of outside funding or to a previous query about what Smartmatic disclosed to Fox after Cohen ordered the voting tech company to disclose funding agreements.New York state courts generally frown on demands for the disclosure of litigation funding agreements. As Smartmatic argued in a Feb. 24 brief asking Cohen to overrule a hearing judge’s order that it turn over any funding documents to Fox, defendants are only entitled to see such agreements if they can show outside funding is directly relevant to claims or defenses in the case. Smartmatic said that Fox’s purported justification – that the identity of any funder would shed light on Smartmatic’s motives for suing Fox – was not sufficient because Fox was merely speculating.Smartmatic was a bit cagey in its brief, arguing vehemently against the disclosure of any litigation funding agreement without saying whether the company had actually entered into any such agreement. “To the extent that they exist,” it argued, “Smartmatic should not have to produce these agreements.”Fox responded that any litigation funding agreement was directly relevant to its counterclaim under New York’s so-called anti-SLAPP law, which was enacted to discourage meritless litigation designed to chill public debate. Fox argued that Smartmatic’s “deeply implausible” demand for nearly $3 billion in damages was the “very definition of trying to chill speech.”According to Fox, the disclosure of Smartmatic’s backers would show “whether Smartmatic’s aggressive claims are being driven by other individuals or entities who have a proverbial axe to grind.”Cohen sided with Fox in his March 24 ruling, holding that the identity of any Smartmatic funder could be relevant to Fox's arguments about Smartmatic's improper motives for suing.Given the judge's ruling, I was eager to read the counterclaims Fox filed this week to find out what it had learned about Smartmatic’s funding. Would Fox assert that some liberal activist was backing Smartmatic's big-money defamation suit in the hopes of tarring the network? Such a scenario would resemble assertions by former President Donald Trump, who claimed in a court filing earlier this month that a prominent Democratic donor is funding a defamation suit over his denial of rape claims by New York writer E. Jean Carroll.Or maybe Fox would allege that Smartmatic was being bankrolled by a competitor on Fox’s right flank. Even the Fox filing revealed only that the voting tech company had made a deal with a traditional litigation financier, I figured it would be interesting to know which funder had a stake in Smartmatic’s case.But to my surprise, Fox’s filing was silent on the matter of litigation funding. Its counterclaim, demanding that Smartmatic pay Fox’s fees and costs for defending a baseless lawsuit, simply re-iterated Fox’s arguments that Smartmatic could not possibly have suffered billions of dollars of harm from the network's reporting of newsworthy allegations of election fraud by Trump and his allies.So far, those arguments have not succeeded in ending the Smartmatic suit. Cohen denied Fox’s dismissal motion last March. An intermediate state appellate court affirmed that ruling in February, despite Fox arguments that it was entitled to immunity for reporting on newsworthy allegations.I'm sure Fox was hoping to cast additional doubt on Smartmatic’s motives by ascribing ill intentions to a litigation funder. But it looks like that's a dead end.Read more:Fox resolves Dominion case, but $2.7 billion Smartmatic lawsuit loomsNo delay for Trump in rape accuser's trial, more discovery allowedFox News must face Smartmatic's lawsuit over election-rigging claims(Reporting By Alison Frankel; editing by Leigh Jones)]"

The Writers Guild of America (WGA) has voted to authorize a strike if a deal with major studios is not reached by May 1st. If a strike does occur, it will cause a full production shutdown, affecting actors, stage crew, studio teams, and the biggest companies in Hollywood, as scripted series across both network TV and streaming grind to a halt.Many in Hollywood have weighed in on the potential strike, with Netflix (NFLX) executives directly addressing it during the company's Q1 2023 earnings call. Netflix said it has a long and robust slate of content just in case there is a strike, but executives reiterated they're at the table and want to find a solution.Yahoo Finance’s Allie Canal breaks down the latest for investors.Video TranscriptALEXANDRA CANAL: Hollywood is facing its first potential writer's strike in 15 years. But it's not a rerun of 2007. Here's what you need to know. The Writers Guild of America, AKA, the WGA, represents thousands of television and movie writers. April 17, the union voted overwhelmingly to authorize a strike if a deal with major studios was not reached by May 1, the day the Guild's three-year contract expires.A strike would cause a full production shutdown, affecting actors, stagehands, studio crew, and the biggest companies in Hollywood as scripted series across both network television and streaming grind to a halt. The WGA have been negotiating with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which bargains on behalf of the studios.The talks have centered on pay concerns brought on by the streaming boom in addition to other fundamental changes within entertainment like the recent wave of cost-cutting measures, which have included layoffs and scrapped projects. What's different today versus prior years is that many of these studios are not pure play production houses anymore, meaning they have their own streaming divisions as well as their own profitability concerns.Story continuesAnd as we know, streaming shows often have less episodes and less residual income compared to traditional network TV, which means less money in the pockets of these writers. Many in Hollywood have weighed in on the potential strike with Netflix executives directly addressing it during the company's Q1 earnings call.TED SARANDOS: We don't want a strike. The last time there was a strike, it was devastating to creators. It was really hard on the industry. It was painful for local economies that support production. And it was very, very, very bad for fans.ALEXANDRA CANAL: Netflix said it has a long and robust slate of content in the event of a strike. But executives reiterated that they're at the table and they want to find a solution. It's similar to what we heard from Warner Brothers Discovery CEO David Zaslav, who told reporters he was optimistic a deal could be reached in a way that's fair to all parties.But they're assuming the worst from a business perspective, and also have backup content produced and ready to go if needed. While some analysts have suggested a strike could be good for cash flow since no new content means no new expenses, the general consensus is that a strike would not be good for the industry.JASON BAZINET: At the end of the day, the street doesn't like the uncertainty that comes with a strike. It's going to just inject more noise as the cadence of new content slows down.ALEXANDRA CANAL: With so much at stake for both parties, the pressure is on to reach a deal. Or else, the industry faces yet another major blow just three years after the pandemic.[MUSIC PLAYING]]"

DeSantis's 14-point advantage over Trump has pulled a Splash Mountain, if you will, to a 13-point deficit.Now, can we expect the woke battle to continue?

I mean, Disney completely outfoxed him on the Reedy Creek development thing.Trump has just so outfoxed him on he putting his fingers in anything. And I just wonder how much more humiliation this man can take, because he's had a horrible, humiliating couple of weeks. He's got to have some limit.DAVE BRIGGS: Is he on the ropes, DeSantis, before he's actually stepped into the ring?JAMES CARVILLE: I think he's on the deck. I think he's already on the canvas, to tell you the truth, but maybe. OK, you could say he's on the ropes, but he's making a fool of himself and Trump is making a fool of him. And what's the backstory here? I'll share it with you quickly, is a woman named Susie Wiles, who was DeSantis' number one political operative and Mrs. DeSantis knocked her off and she went to work with Trump. And you can see that her elbows were sharp and she's just beating the living you know what out of him. And that's what happens in politics. You make the wrong people mad and you pay a price for it. And he's paying it right now.Story continuesDAVE BRIGGS: That's how it's playing out. So they've got another one, though. They've got another woke war, if you will, and that's with Bud Light, whose promotion with transgender TikTok star Dylan Mulvaney has really become a rallying cry for the right. Donald Trump Jr, surprisingly, defending Bud Light here. Who you got in this?JAMES CARVILLE: Well, Bud Light. It doesn't matter. It's all a proxy thing. And even when I grew up, I thought companies wanted to sell as much of their product as they could to as many people as they could.And I guess the Budweiser people or whatever thought they could market to this group. I don't even understand the parameters of this. I don't drink light beer anyway, but I don't even understand what-- They just got to be outraged about something and this is just, I guess it's something to be outraged about. I have no idea. It's just not in my wheelhouse.And I don't think this stuff is working very well for them, by the way, just so you know. They keep coming up, again, it's one stunt after another. You've got to understand, at the core, when you're all about stunts, you have to keep pulling off more stunts. There's no way you can get off.You're the rabbit on a hamster wheel. That's what you're on when you start in the stunt business. And that's all they are is stunts.DAVE BRIGGS: James, you more of a tequila guy, not a Bud Light guy?JAMES CARVILLE: I'm more of a bourbon guy, to tell you the truth. My roots in Kentucky go back a long way. But I like my poison brown.DAVE BRIGGS: Next time we'll have one of those. All right, so it's interesting, because you hear about Bud Light, you hear about Disney, and what you don't hear about from DeSantis or any of the other 24 Republicans is Trump. You don't hear a word about it. And it's interesting because Chris Christie, he equated this to Voldemort, the legendary ""Harry Potter"" villain who you do not speak his name. How long can that strategy of not mentioning your true opponent, how long does that work?JAMES CARVILLE: I don't think it's working right now. I mean, how long is it working? Well, that assumes that it's working. I don't think it's working very well right now. Look, I think all of America politics can be summed up by the incident in Kansas City.The granddad, the grandson, and the Black guy, that explains everything that you need to know. And the granddad had Fox blaring on the TV every waking hour he was up. The grandson didn't like it, and of course, he shoots, unfortunately, the Black kid. And to understand that is to understand the modern Republican Party. You don't need any other explanation.DAVE BRIGGS: Is it over? Is Trump the '24 nominee?JAMES CARVILLE: Well, it certainly feels that way. And in a recession, who am I to sit here and say he can't win again? No one in their right mind can say that. I don't know how many more indictments are coming.I don't know how much more anything else is. I think a change of, like, 42,000 vote, he would have won in 2020. So he's a worthy adversary and people better pay attention to what's going on there. And if we don't get turnout up in some of these heavily Democratic areas, I'm scared to death about 2024, I'll be honest with you.DAVE BRIGGS: Keep your eye on Virginia, though. I'm not convinced Glenn Youngkin, the governor, doesn't throw his hat into the game late there. But President Biden reportedly could kick off his '24 campaign as soon as Tuesday with a robust 42-point approval rating. What could go wrong there? Are you excited for the Biden campaign to run again?JAMES CARVILLE: Well, look, it's politics. What could go wrong? A lot could go wrong and a lot probably will. That's just the nature.I think Youngkin has any chance at all to get the Republican nomination, as long as Trump in. For some reason he's unable to run, a health issues or legal issues or something like that, then you'd probably have a different ballgame. But Trump is the Republican Party.We shouldn't kid ourselves. Maybe some Republicans don't like to hear that, but he is and he dominates it like no one I've ever seen in my life dominate any political party. So I don't think Trump cares a wit's petulia about Glenn Youngkin at all.DAVE BRIGGS: Who would you like to see challenge Joe Biden on the left? Or do you think he's the right nominee for right now?JAMES CARVILLE: Well, let's just put it very simply. There are more people working in American anytime in 50 years. There are more people that have health care in America than any time in American history. Both those are two pretty important metrics in assessing the success of a presidency, and by those metrics, he's probably the most successful President we've had the last 100 years.DAVE BRIGGS: So you'd like him to be the nominee, yes?JAMES CARVILLE: Yeah.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best Entertainment Stocks To Buy In 2023. It is projected that the media and entertainment industry will continue to undergo transformations in 2023. As per Deloitte, both studios and video streaming services must deal with the challenge of market disruption, attempting to generate profits in a less lucrative business environment. They are not only vying against each other for audience attention, time, and revenue, but also against social media, user-generated content, and video games. The latter have advanced more rapidly and have remained popular among younger age groups.Ernst and Young believes that there will be an increase in mergers and acquisitions within the media industry, as well as more deliberate partnerships and collaborations. EY highlighted many new trends for the media industry in 2023. The firm noted that to achieve sustained success in streaming, it is crucial to establish a strong and enduring relationship with subscribers. Many media companies currently operating in the direct-to-consumer (DTC) market are following the lead of the successful cable TV model by offering bundled packages of streaming content and other services. By doing so, these companies can not only increase the number of new subscribers and reduce the rate of subscriber loss, but also enhance the lifetime value of each subscriber. Bundling can also help to optimize marketing expenses and technology investments, thereby increasing efficiency. Moreover, investors are increasingly pushing for profitability in the direct-to-consumer (DTC) market, which is likely to spur further consolidation within the industry. This is particularly true for the smaller players who depend on the revenue generated by declining linear assets, and who are facing mounting pressure to adapt to the changing market dynamics. Despite some positive developments for major blockbuster films in theaters this year, the movie industry as a whole is undergoing a significant restructuring. According to BoxOfficeMojo.com, box office revenue has declined by more than 30% compared to pre-pandemic years. The total number of films released in 2022 is also significantly lower than the average for the previous decade, resulting in fewer options for consumers who are considering going to the theater, which in turn is leading to a decrease in overall admissions. As a result, studios are reassessing which types of movies are economically viable for a theatrical release, versus those that would be better suited for a direct-to-streaming approach.Story continuesSimilarly, EY thinks that although the initial hype surrounding NFTs and the concept of a metaverse-driven future may have dwindled in late 2022 due to the dominance of macroeconomic factors, media companies are still gearing up for the next era of interactivity. These companies are focusing on strategic planning, research and development, consumer research, and technology investment to ensure that they remain flexible as the metaverse becomes more tangible. Streaming video, social media, and gaming are facilitating the emergence of new business models and transforming the media and entertainment landscape. However, the primary trend to watch out for in 2023 is the growing interdependence of these three sectors, as they become integral components of a more comprehensive and diverse media and entertainment ecosystem. Some of the best entertainment stocks to buy in 2023 include The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), and Caesars Entertainment, Inc.

The company continued to generate strong free cash flow that it is using to invest into its casinos, pay out dividends, and buy back shares. The company has repurchased 8% of its shares over the past year while paying out a 1% dividend. We believe Boyd can withstand any bumps in the economy given its strong balance sheet and free cash flow. We also don’t think Boyd’s share price reflects its 5% ownership in online bookmaker FanDuel.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best News and Digital Media Stocks To Buy. According to Deloitte, it is expected that the media and entertainment industry will undergo further changes in 2023. Companies involved in film production and streaming services are dealing with their own disruption in the market and attempting to generate profits in a less lucrative environment. In addition to competing with each other for audience attention, time, and revenue, they are also contending with social media, user-generated content, and video games. Video games have progressed rapidly and appeal strongly to younger demographics.In 2020, the entertainment industry experienced a significant decline, with music events canceled, theaters shutting down, and sports matches played without live audiences. However, in 2023, the industry is optimistic that it will be able to recapture the communal experience of sold-out events, crowded cinemas, and lively arenas.Despite the challenges faced by the entertainment industry, consumers are returning to their preferred venues and platforms in promising numbers. Gower Street Analytics reports that the global box office reached $25.9 billion in 2022, marking a 27% increase from 2021. However, this is still 35% lower than the average for the three years prior to the pandemic. Live music revenue is predicted to surpass pre-pandemic levels by 2024, with digital music streaming subscriptions driving growth in recorded music. PwC estimates that recorded music revenues will rise from $36.1 billion in 2021 to $45.8 billion in 2026. Live theater is also making a comeback, with the Society of London Theatre reporting a 7.21% increase in attendance and 7.9% capacity in 2022 compared to 2019. While box-office revenue fell by 1.1% in real terms, Broadway shows grossed $51.9 million during the 2022 holiday week, up from $26.3 million for the same week the previous year. The sports industry is also proving to be particularly resilient, with teams projected to maintain growth in attendance and revenue despite a mild recession forecasted by Fitch for Q2 2023 in the US.Story continuesWARC's analysis in the beginning of March 2023 mentions various digital media companies that are taking ad revenue away from print media. For instance, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) generated $37.7 billion in ad revenue last year, which is 80% of what print media is predicted to make in 2023. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s ad revenue is expected to grow by 20.8% this year compared to 2022, and it's likely that their global ad revenue will soon surpass that of print media. According to the report, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) will probably earn almost $400 billion in ad revenue this year, which accounts for about 40% of the total worldwide share. Meanwhile, ad revenue for traditional video, audio, and out-of-home advertising is projected to grow by only 1.6% compared to 2016, despite the shift from legacy to digital platforms. Although the migration from legacy to digital has been prominent in other forms of media, it has not been as widespread for print media.Not too long ago, print media used to dominate the global advertising revenue. According to WARC, in 1980, print media accounted for 62.4% of all global ad spending, and it wasn't until 2001 that television overtook newspapers in terms of ad revenue. By 2010, despite the emergence of the digital advertising opportunities provided by Google and Facebook, print media still accounted for around 30% of global ad revenue. However, in 2007, the global ad revenue for print newspapers reached its peak at $121.4 billion, but WARC predicts that by 2023, it will fall to $22.8 billion.Although the future of print media looks gloomy, there have been a few positive developments. According to media analyst Brian Morrissey, in an interview with WARC, The New York Times Company (NYSE:NYT) has been a prominent example of success in digital ad revenue, providing a sustainable and profitable business model for news companies. The newspaper has experienced a surge in digital subscription revenue during the Trump presidency and the COVID-19 pandemic, making it a model for success for other news organizations to follow.Some of the best entertainment stocks to invest in include Netflix, Inc.

The company gained credibility, and its stock reacted favorably, after it announced a partnership with Amazon to deploy a 5G cloud-native network using AWS’s cloud infrastructure. While the stock has been volatile in recent quarters, we continue to feel confident in Dish’s long-term prospects, which include competing as a fourth U.S. wireless carrier. Charter Communications has been executing well and benefiting from the growth in residential broadband, which has been accelerated by COVID-19 and should see further support from the Biden Administration’s infrastructure bill, which earmarks $65 billion for broadband buildout. In addition, we expect the company to continue to grow its wireless business, leveraging its mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) relationship with Verizon. The company continues to generate strong and growing free cash flow and deploys it toward consistent and material share buybacks.”6.

(OKE). This company, which is in the Zacks Oil and Gas - Production Pipeline - MLB industry, shows potential for another earnings beat.This natural gas company has an established record of topping earnings estimates, especially when looking at the previous two reports. The company boasts an average surprise for the past two quarters of 4.55%.For the last reported quarter, Oneok came out with earnings of $1.08 per share versus the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.02 per share, representing a surprise of 5.88%. For the previous quarter, the company was expected to post earnings of $0.93 per share and it actually produced earnings of $0.96 per share, delivering a surprise of 3.23%.Price and EPS SurpriseThanks in part to this history, there has been a favorable change in earnings estimates for Oneok lately. In fact, the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) for the stock is positive, which is a great indicator of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesOneok currently has an Earnings ESP of +11.63%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on May 2, 2023.When the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher. On the other hand, some stocks may hold their ground even if they end up missing the consensus estimate.Because of this, it's really important to check a company's Earnings ESP ahead of its quarterly release to increase the odds of success. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, you can directly visit Analysts Are Downgrading These 5 Stocks.The US equity futures market exhibits little movement in all three indices (S&amp;P, Dow, and Nasdaq) as of April 21. Meanwhile, the key Eurozone indices are experiencing a slight uptick of around 10 basis points, with notable outperformance in the luxury, insurance, media, healthcare, energy, and utilities sectors. In contrast, basic resources, banks, retail, chemicals, and industrials are struggling. Basic resource stocks are taking a hit, with Rio Tinto, BHP, Anglo America, ArcelorMittal, and other major players experiencing a sharp decline of over 2%.The Fed tends to focus on its feet when evaluating economic strategies, and due to the absence of significant information before the May gathering, it appears more probable that an increase of 25 basis points will occur next month (Williams and Mester both hinted at another rate hike arriving on May 3). However, Powell's two primary indicators (employment and prices) are progressing in the intended direction at a hastened pace, implying that the US monetary policy will soon reach a more relaxed point, probably around a year-end Funds Rate estimate of 4.5-4.6%. In the most recent week, there was a minor uptick in borrowing at the Discount Window and the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP).The trend of declining inflation briefly halted during January and February. Still, it picked up again in March, and it appears to be gaining momentum in April (as demonstrated by the price-related elements of the Empire and Philadelphia reports). In other news related to rising prices, a recent article by Reuters advised major consumer goods companies to exercise caution in implementing price increases, as investors are concerned that they may lose market share to more affordable competitors.Story continuesOverall, the S&amp;P 500 Index constituents is expected to report a 5-6% decline in first quarter earnings. That's not a big number at all which is why the S&amp;P 500 Index has been unexpectedly resilient so far this year. According to Factset, analysts are actually projecting an earnings growth of 0.9% for the calendar year 2023 and the S&amp;P 500 Index currently has a forward PE ratio of around 18. Obviously, some companies will be negatively impacted by the Fed's interest rates policies and the macroeconomic developments in the market.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) were among the notable stocks that were recently downgraded by analysts. Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:CFG) was downgraded due to the company's updated FY23 NII guidance, which failed to meet expectations, while ratings for Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc. (NYSE:BBWI) were cut due to ongoing margin pressures. Check out the complete article to see the details of these downgrades.Most Promising Micro-Cap Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by AlphaTradeZone10. CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21The self-storage industry has proven to be resilient regardless of economic conditions and is benefiting from the trend of decreasing home sizes. Americans tend to accumulate more possessions over time, which leads to continued demand for self-storage facilities. This industry has low barriers to entry and is dominated by a few large players, including CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE). CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) primarily operates in high-quality and established markets, with a significant portion of its income coming from the top 25 markets in the US. The company also targets densely populated areas with an average population of almost 200K within a 3-mile radius.On April 20, Keegan Carl, an analyst at Wolfe Research, downgraded CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) rating from Outperform to Peer Perform, without providing a specific price target. According to the analyst, the reason for the downgrade is the stock's valuation. However, the analyst has stated that the long-term outlook for CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) is still positive.09. Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) has experienced robust revenue growth, particularly in its Viator segment. Nevertheless, increasing expenses have been creating difficulties for the company's earnings. Analysts anticipate that the stock's growth may be limited in the near to mid-term.According to Truist's analyst Patrick Scholes, Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) earnings forecast for 2023, 2024, and 2025 has been revised downwards. The largest reduction in the estimate was for 2024, and due to limited visibility in the industry, no forecasts were given beyond 2025. Consequently, on April 20, the analyst downgraded Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) rating from Buy to Hold, and the stock's price target was cut from $40 to $21.08. Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32On April 20, Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC) was downgraded to Sell from Hold by Pito Chickering, a Deutsche Bank analyst, with a new price target of $63, down from $75. The analyst worries that the CTC business's methadone clinics could move from a 10% growth category to a slower-growing sector or even become a headwind due to a decline in opioid patients. While the firm holds the management of Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC) in high regard and is uncertain about the timing of the negative drivers, it believes investors should consider the short-term risks from Medicaid redetermination and the longer-term risk from the MAT Act's drag on the CTC business when assessing Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC).07. NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) provides IT storage solutions that offer software to help companies manage, safeguard, and optimize their data stored in cloud resources. Although the company is operating in a fast-growing industry, it seems to be struggling to progress. Even though NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) is returning more than 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders, its revenue is shrinking, which may cause its stock multiple to decrease over time. Although the company's strong balance sheet and commitment to returning free cash flow to investors are appealing, it is not meeting expectations. As a result, its stock multiple, such as P/E, could decrease going forward.NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) has been downgraded to Underperform from Neutral on April 20 by BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan, who has set a new price target of $58, down from $70. The analyst believes a weaker demand environment will hinder product revenue growth in FY24, although there will be some benefit to gross margins. However, due to reduced revenue, negative leverage is also expected. Furthermore, the firm argues that a slowdown in the public cloud will create a headwind through FY24.06. F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) has experienced a 30% drop in its share price due to a pessimistic industry outlook, exacerbated by persistent supply chain challenges. The company's balance sheet remains healthy, although some weaknesses have been revealed. Management has acknowledged that the sector will face headwinds that will impede revenue growth, coupled with economic uncertainties. Analysts doubt the company's high P/E ratio, recommending that investors exercise patience in a challenging environment that may result in further share price declines.The tech industry experienced significant growth during the pandemic as companies scrambled to adapt to remote working environments. This trend is expected to continue with the rise of hybrid working arrangements. However, the supply chain issues and uncertainties caused by the pandemic are still prevalent in 2023, casting a shadow over the industry's prospects. Despite these challenges, F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) liquidity remains robust, with a sizable cash reserve of $605 million and no outstanding debt. This financial position is desirable in the turbulent economic climate that many predict, although the timing and severity of any potential downturn remain uncertain.On April 20, F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) was downgraded from Overweight to Equal Weight by Barclays, with a new price target of $140, down from $166. Although the company's overall results for the March quarter were in line, there were significant shortfalls in the software segment, according to the analyst's research note to investors. Due to F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) inconsistent software segment and inadequate growth, the firm sees no potential upside for the shares and has downgraded its rating while also reducing its estimates.Click to continue reading and see Analysts Are Downgrading These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:12 Best Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy10 Undervalued Lithium Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Telecom Dividend Stocks To Buy for 2023Disclosure.

If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 Best News and Digital Media Stocks To Buy. According to Deloitte, it is expected that the media and entertainment industry will undergo further changes in 2023. Companies involved in film production and streaming services are dealing with their own disruption in the market and attempting to generate profits in a less lucrative environment. In addition to competing with each other for audience attention, time, and revenue, they are also contending with social media, user-generated content, and video games. Video games have progressed rapidly and appeal strongly to younger demographics.In 2020, the entertainment industry experienced a significant decline, with music events canceled, theaters shutting down, and sports matches played without live audiences. However, in 2023, the industry is optimistic that it will be able to recapture the communal experience of sold-out events, crowded cinemas, and lively arenas.Despite the challenges faced by the entertainment industry, consumers are returning to their preferred venues and platforms in promising numbers. Gower Street Analytics reports that the global box office reached $25.9 billion in 2022, marking a 27% increase from 2021. However, this is still 35% lower than the average for the three years prior to the pandemic. Live music revenue is predicted to surpass pre-pandemic levels by 2024, with digital music streaming subscriptions driving growth in recorded music. PwC estimates that recorded music revenues will rise from $36.1 billion in 2021 to $45.8 billion in 2026. Live theater is also making a comeback, with the Society of London Theatre reporting a 7.21% increase in attendance and 7.9% capacity in 2022 compared to 2019. While box-office revenue fell by 1.1% in real terms, Broadway shows grossed $51.9 million during the 2022 holiday week, up from $26.3 million for the same week the previous year. The sports industry is also proving to be particularly resilient, with teams projected to maintain growth in attendance and revenue despite a mild recession forecasted by Fitch for Q2 2023 in the US.Story continuesWARC's analysis in the beginning of March 2023 mentions various digital media companies that are taking ad revenue away from print media. For instance, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) generated $37.7 billion in ad revenue last year, which is 80% of what print media is predicted to make in 2023. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s ad revenue is expected to grow by 20.8% this year compared to 2022, and it's likely that their global ad revenue will soon surpass that of print media. According to the report, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) will probably earn almost $400 billion in ad revenue this year, which accounts for about 40% of the total worldwide share. Meanwhile, ad revenue for traditional video, audio, and out-of-home advertising is projected to grow by only 1.6% compared to 2016, despite the shift from legacy to digital platforms. Although the migration from legacy to digital has been prominent in other forms of media, it has not been as widespread for print media.Not too long ago, print media used to dominate the global advertising revenue. According to WARC, in 1980, print media accounted for 62.4% of all global ad spending, and it wasn't until 2001 that television overtook newspapers in terms of ad revenue. By 2010, despite the emergence of the digital advertising opportunities provided by Google and Facebook, print media still accounted for around 30% of global ad revenue. However, in 2007, the global ad revenue for print newspapers reached its peak at $121.4 billion, but WARC predicts that by 2023, it will fall to $22.8 billion.Although the future of print media looks gloomy, there have been a few positive developments. According to media analyst Brian Morrissey, in an interview with WARC, The New York Times Company (NYSE:NYT) has been a prominent example of success in digital ad revenue, providing a sustainable and profitable business model for news companies. The newspaper has experienced a surge in digital subscription revenue during the Trump presidency and the COVID-19 pandemic, making it a model for success for other news organizations to follow.Some of the best entertainment stocks to invest in include Netflix, Inc.

Dish Network continues to make progress on the buildout of its greenfield 5G network, with Las Vegas slated to become the first market launched later this year. The company gained credibility, and its stock reacted favorably, after it announced a partnership with Amazon to deploy a 5G cloud-native network using AWS’s cloud infrastructure. While the stock has been volatile in recent quarters, we continue to feel confident in Dish’s long-term prospects, which include competing as a fourth U.S. wireless carrier. Charter Communications has been executing well and benefiting from the growth in residential broadband, which has been accelerated by COVID-19 and should see further support from the Biden Administration’s infrastructure bill, which earmarks $65 billion for broadband buildout. In addition, we expect the company to continue to grow its wireless business, leveraging its mobile virtual network operator (MVNO) relationship with Verizon. The company continues to generate strong and growing free cash flow and deploys it toward consistent and material share buybacks.”6.

While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis consumer products maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.70 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -5.4%.Revenues are expected to be $4.61 billion, up 4.7% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.79% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Colgate-Palmolive?For Colgate-Palmolive, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.43%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2.So, this combination indicates that Colgate-Palmolive will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Colgate-Palmolive would post earnings of $0.77 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.77, delivering no surprise.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates just once.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Colgate-Palmolive appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAmong the stocks in the Zacks Soap and Cleaning Materials industry, Church &amp; Dwight (CHD) is soon expected to post earnings of $0.76 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -8.4%. This quarter's revenue is expected to be $1.35 billion, up 4.3% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Church &amp; Dwight has been revised 1.9% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a higher Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of 1.65%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Church &amp; Dwight will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Recently, CL broke through the 200-day moving average, which suggests a long-term bullish trend.The 200-day simple moving average is widely-used by traders and analysts, and helps establish market trends for stocks, commodities, indexes, and other financial instruments over the long term.

But which of these two stocks is more attractive to value investors? We'll need to take a closer look to find out.There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits.Juniper Networks has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Motorola has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. This system places an emphasis on companies that have seen positive earnings estimate revisions, so investors should feel comfortable knowing that JNPR is likely seeing its earnings outlook improve to a greater extent. But this is only part of the picture for value investors.Value investors analyze a variety of traditional, tried-and-true metrics to help find companies that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels.The Style Score Value grade factors in a variety of key fundamental metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a number of other key stats that are commonly used by value investors.JNPR currently has a forward P/E ratio of 13.63, while MSI has a forward P/E of 25.73. We also note that JNPR has a PEG ratio of 1.96. This metric is used similarly to the famous P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also takes into account the stock's expected earnings growth rate. MSI currently has a PEG ratio of 2.86.Another notable valuation metric for JNPR is its P/B ratio of 2.24. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, MSI has a P/B of 367.23.Story continuesThese are just a few of the metrics contributing to JNPR's Value grade of B and MSI's Value grade of C.JNPR stands above MSI thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that JNPR is the superior value option right now.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The funding will allow The Arc to establish more Tech Coaching Centers at chapters across the country and offer The Arc@School special education advocacy curriculum to Spanish-speaking families. These programs have already helped over 3,500 people with IDD develop more independence, equity, and opportunities for their future.$710K In new grants to The Arc to expand Tech Coaching Centers""Far too many people with IDD are left behind in our society,"" said Ruben Rodriguez, COO and Acting CEO of The Arc of the United States. ""A quality educational experience and understanding of technology is fundamental in creating equal opportunities of all kinds. These systems continue to deepen extraordinary disparities among people with IDD, especially underrepresented communities and low-income families. Our continued partnership with Comcast is making opportunity a reality for all people with IDD. It's chiseling away at our society's rampant inequities and helping everyone - no matter your disability - build bright futures.""A first grant of $560,000, will support The Arc's Tech Coaching Centers at 10 locations across the country. It will also expand the training model to include caregivers and family members of people with IDD to ensure they can support in the implementation of technology across all environments, including assistive technology.With technology being an increasingly vital part of navigating and participating in today's plugged-in world, including transportation, employment, recreation and social interaction, people with IDD face unique barriers to understanding and adopting digital tools, which are exacerbated by a higher rate of poverty and lower overall income. Since 2014, Comcast has supported The Arc's Tech Coaching Center, reaching nearly 2,500 people with IDD through 19 chapters and giving them access to devices, services, and training that advance measured outcomes in employment, health, independent living, education, and interpersonal connections.Story continues""We know that digital skills training can open new doors to opportunity and help people living with disabilities gain independence,"" said Dalila Wilson-Scott, EVP and Chief Diversity Officer of Comcast Corporation.We are proud to continue our long-standing partnership with The Arc to reach even more people with IDD - including their caregivers and families - and to create pathways that can help enrich their lives.DALILA WILSON-SCOTTEVP and Chief Diversity Officer of Comcast CorporationA second grant of $150,000 will go towards advancing efforts to help marginalized communities better advocate for their education. This investment will allow The Arc to fully translate the curriculum into Spanish to better meet this population's needs and increase access to the content.Academic achievement and graduation rates for students with disabilities lag far behind their peers, trends marked by inordinate discrimination, suspensions, and isolation within school settings across the country. In 2016, The Arc created The Arc@School, an evidence-based, self-paced online training program designed to help families, educators, and advocates navigate the special education system. Since 2021, Comcast has partnered with The Arc to connect underserved communities to these educational advocacy resources. To date, more than 500 families of color and low-income households have been given free access to The Arc@School, in addition to a facilitation guide, Spanish language overview of the special education process, and cultural competency resources and sections.These grants were distributed through Project UP, Comcast's $1 billion commitment to reach tens of millions of people in order to advance digital equity and help create a future of unlimited possibilities.Comcast Corporation, Friday, April 21, 2023, Press release pictureView additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Comcast Corporation on 3blmedia.com.Contact Info:Spokesperson: Comcast CorporationWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/comcast-corporationEmail: info@3blmedia.comSOURCE: Comcast CorporationView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/750671/Comcast-and-the-Arc-Partner-To-Expand-Tech-Training-and-Special-Education-Advocacy-for-People-With-Disabilities]"

This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 28, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis cable provider is expected to post quarterly earnings of $7.22 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +4.6%.Revenues are expected to be $13.57 billion, up 2.8% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.51% lower over the last 30 days to the current level.

(NYSE:PRU) is favoured by institutional owners who hold 58% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/prudential-financial-inc-nyse-pru-120021606.html,1682078421,STORY,['PRU'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Prudential Financial's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisions40% of the business is held by the top 25 shareholders Recent sales by insiders Every investor in Prudential Financial, Inc. (NYSE:PRU) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. With 58% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).Since institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.In the chart below, we zoom in on the different ownership groups of Prudential Financial. Check out our latest analysis for Prudential Financial ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Prudential Financial?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.Prudential Financial already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Prudential Financial's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story.Story continuesearnings-and-revenue-growthSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Hedge funds don't have many shares in Prudential Financial. The company's largest shareholder is BlackRock, Inc., with ownership of 9.1%. In comparison, the second and third largest shareholders hold about 8.6% and 4.8% of the stock.A deeper look at our ownership data shows that the top 25 shareholders collectively hold less than half of the register, suggesting a large group of small holders where no single shareholder has a majority.While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Prudential FinancialWhile the precise definition of an insider can be subjective, almost everyone considers board members to be insiders. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.Insider ownership is positive when it signals leadership are thinking like the true owners of the company. However, high insider ownership can also give immense power to a small group within the company. This can be negative in some circumstances.Our information suggests that Prudential Financial, Inc. insiders own under 1% of the company. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$55m worth of shares. Arguably recent buying and selling is just as important to consider. You can  click here to see if insiders have been buying or selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public-- including retail investors -- own 41% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:I find it very interesting to look at who exactly owns a company. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too.

To skip the analysis and recent events in the oil and gas industry, go directly to the Top 5 Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds.Despite the high volatility in the oil and gas industries, the commodities are traded in high volumes and are highly profitable if bought at the right times. Both commodities are a part of the conventional energy market which accounted for 85% of global energy needs in 2022, as mentioned in our article about the largest energy companies.Oil Market Updates and ForecastAccording to the US Energy Information Administration’s (EIA) short-term energy outlook posted in April, the Brent Crude oil spot price is estimated to be around $85 per barrel in Q2 2023 which is $2 higher than the price forecast provided a month ago. The estimates revision is owed to OPEC’s announcement of cutting over a million barrels of oil per day on April 2. The announcement was led by Saudi Arabia cutting around 500,000 barrels of oil per day and later was followed by a few other members. In total, OPEC decided to cut the production of oil by around 1.16 million barrels per day.The oil supply was already projected to shrink in the second half of 2022 as Russia had announced a production cut in crude oil by around 500,000 barrels per day between March and December 2023 due to the G7’s price cap and sanctions on Russian fuel imports. However, in March 2023, the total Russian crude oil production cuts amounted to over 700,000 barrels per day. These production cuts could lead the average crude oil prices to go higher for the rest of 2023.After OPEC’s announcement, on April 3, the Brent and WTI Crude futures and oil stocks experienced a significant gain. Among the oil stocks in the S&amp;P 500, Marathon Oil Corporation (NYSE:MRO) was the biggest gainer with its stock price rising by almost 10% at the end of the day. ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP) and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) gained around 9% and 5.9%, respectively.Story continuesGas Market Updates and ForecastFor natural gas, the EIA has some bad news for the second half of 2023. The average natural gas spot price is expected to be around $2.65 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in the second quarter and for the full year, the agency predicts the commodity’s price to be around $3.00 per MMBtu, declining by over 50% from the prior year. The natural gas prices declined in the first quarter of 2023 due to the low rate of withdrawals, leading to the inventories rising above the 5-year average.In the coming months, natural gas prices will depend on several factors. The recent warmer winters have resulted in a decline in natural gas demand. Nevertheless, warmer-than-usual summers could lead to a rise in demand in the electricity production sector causing the prices to surge. However, as natural gas is often called associated gas due to its production associated with crude oil production. An increase in oil drilling due to higher prices can lead to increased production of natural gas which can put downward pressure on natural gas prices.In these volatile market conditions, some of the best energy stocks are Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB).Top 10 Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge FundsCopyright: 3dsculptor / 123RF Stock PhotoOur MethodologyWe compiled this list of the top 10 oil and gas stocks purely based on their hedge fund sentiment as of the fourth quarter of 2022. The data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds.Top 10 Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds10. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) is a hydrocarbon exploration company headquartered in Oklahoma. Most of the company’s reserves consist of petroleum followed by natural gas and natural gas liquids. Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) has assets distributed across the US Midwest but most of its operations take place in the Permian Basin.With increased inflation, companies have been experiencing an increase in breakeven WTI prices. However, for Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), the breakeven is $40 WTI, which is quite well-regulated compared to its peers. Moreover, the company exited FY 2022 with $4.5 billion in liquidity and carries a strong balance sheet currently.In the fourth quarter of 2022, 55 hedge funds had a stake in Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) compared to 51 in the previous quarter. Yacktman Asset Management was the biggest hedge fund holder for the quarter with over 2.8 million shares worth $172.525 million.According to hedge funds, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Occidental Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:OXY), and Schlumberger Limited (NYSE:SLB) are some of the best energy to invest in along with Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN).Here is what GoodHaven Capital Management had to say about Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN) in its Q2 2022 investor letter:“Our biggest dollar gainer within this period was Devon Energy Corporation (NYSE:DVN), a position which emanated from a takeover in early 2021 of our long time holding WPX Energy. We are sitting on a material (unrealized) gain from our cost and are now receiving material dividends thanks to Devon’s thoughtful fixed/variable dividend policy. Energy is now a hot sector for investors but we have had a material exposure for a long time. We remember a bit too well $40 oil, NEGATIVELY PRICED front-month oil contract, and what it’s like to own a company with leverage and negative free cash flow during such periods. Our desire to have our biggest portfolio exposures be high return, growing, reasonably predictable and moderately levered companies lead us to reduce our Devon exposure in the past. When the recent facts and circumstances for the industry changed and appeared supportive of healthy oil prices, we decided to maintain a sizable holding and more recently added to the position. At Devon’s Q1 dividend rate, which is mostly variable in nature, the shares now yield approximately 10% and our yield on our average cost is materially higher. In addition, we maintain additional energy exposure through our long-term (and successful) holding in Hess Midstream and less directly through TerraVest and Berkshire Hathaway’s energy investments.”9. Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Pioneer Natural Resources Company (NYSE:PXD) is a Texan hydrocarbon exploration company operating in the Permian Basin.

They reported a slight beat to production estimates with other metrics within their guidance range. The company continued with its aggressive capital return program inclusive of a sizable quarterly dividend and share repurchases. Management announced a shift to its drilling plans by focusing on acreage with higher expected returns.”8.

However, the company has a strong balance sheet, and natural gas prices are expected to recover slightly in the latter part of the year which can create a good entry point for EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) investors.Artisan Partners made the following comment about EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Finally, shares of US natural gas producer EQT Corporation (NYSE:EQT) fell on lower-than-expected production due to extreme weather in December. However, the company still produced strong free cash flow that beat expectations. EQT is one of the largest producers of natural gas, an energy source that emits significantly less carbon dioxide than other fossil fuels, such as coal or oil.

So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.Over the past month, shares of this oil and gas exploration company have returned +15.6%, compared to the Zacks S&amp;P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Oil and Gas - Exploration and Production - United States industry, which Devon Energy falls in, has gained 11.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.Revisions to Earnings EstimatesRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.For the current quarter, Devon Energy is expected to post earnings of $1.44 per share, indicating a change of -23.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -10.1% over the last 30 days.For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.49 points to a change of -21.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -7%.Story continuesFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.13 indicates a change of +9.8% from what Devon Energy is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.Having a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Devon Energy is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:12 Month EPS12-month consensus EPS estimate for DVN _12MonthEPSChartUrlRevenue Growth ForecastEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.For Devon Energy, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $4 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +4.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $16.66 billion and $17 billion estimates indicate -13.1% and +2% changes, respectively.Last Reported Results and Surprise HistoryDevon Energy reported revenues of $4.3 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +0.6%. EPS of $1.66 for the same period compares with $1.39 a year ago.Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.65 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -7.5%. The EPS surprise was -5.14%.Over the last four quarters, Devon Energy surpassed consensus EPS estimates three times. The company topped consensus revenue estimates two times over this period.ValuationNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.Devon Energy is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.Bottom LineThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Devon Energy. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Buy stocks now that will eventually appreciate over time, and create an income stream that should also theoretically grow alongside said earnings. Many long-term investors are always on the hunt for these “golden geese”.That said, for those looking to add exposure to dividend-paying stocks, obviously not all are created equal. Some may have distributions that are unsustainable, while others may lack the kind of growth that’s necessary to sustain dividend increases to keep pace with inflation over time.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsAccordingly, the dividend-paying stocks investors choose must have solid financial prospects, and a core business model that’s resilient to disruption. Here are three great options on my radar right now.Realty Income Corporation (O)Hands holding a miniature house and keysSource: ShutterstockFirst on this list of dividend-paying stocks to buy is Realty Income Corporation (NYSE:O), a real estate investment trust specializing in acquiring and owning commercial properties across the United States. With a portfolio primarily composed of essential goods and services, Realty Income is in a solid position to profit from the resurgence of the retail real estate market.Most annualized rental revenue for this particular real estate investment trust come from retail tenants whose businesses offer services, essential goods, or low-priced products. Additionally, the trust has a well-diversified portfolio encompassing various tenants, industries, geographic locations, and property types.Realty Income’s external growth appears promising due to its successful acquisitions and development projects. In 2022, the company invested a substantial amount of $8.9 billion towards 1,301 properties, which included properties under expansion or development.Story continuesRealty Income has an extensive record of raising dividends, earning it the trademarked title of “The Monthly Dividend Company” due to their monthly dividend payments. Although the Covid-19 recession was brief, lasting only two months, it resulted in very few companies increasing their dividends during that period. However, during the more significant Great Recession of 2007-2009, Realty Income increased its monthly dividend thrice.O is currently traded at a reasonable multiple of 15.4-times 2022 Funds from Operation (FFO) per share, which is typical for a high-quality real estate investment trust. In addition, the stock boasts an impressive dividend yield of 4.9%, nearly three times higher than the S&amp;P 500 average. Realty Income should be seen as a solid, conservative choice for a core holding for any income-focused investor.Devon Energy (DVN)The logo for Devon Energy (DVN) is displayed on a sign outside an office.Source: Jeff Whyte / Shutterstock.comDevon Energy (NYSE:DVN), a hydrocarbon exploration company based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, is among the best dividend growth stocks available due to its underlying relevance. For passive income investors, Devon provides an impressive forward yield of 6.63%, surpassing the average yield of the energy sector, which stands at 4.24%. Despite having a relatively elevated payout ratio of 51.68%, Devon’s dividend payout remains manageable.Potential investors in Devon Energy can take advantage of a possible bargaining opportunity. Presently, the market values DVN stock at a trailing multiple of 5.2-times earnings. This places the company ahead of 61.9% of competitors, when considering discounted earnings. Thus, Devon trades at a forward multiple of 6.7-times, ranking the company better than 60% of the industry.In the company’s Q4 and full-year 2022 results press release, Devon Energy revealed a fixed dividend increase of 11% for 2023. Devon also plans to allocate $3.6 billion to $3.8 billion toward capital expenditures. This is due to the temporary installation of a fourth frac that expanded in its Delaware Basin during the quarter.Devon Energy is highly-effective in its operations, with a five-year earnings growth rate of 54.3%, surpassing 86% of its competitors. In addition, its net margin stands at 31.38%, higher than 83% of its sector. Moreover, analysts covering the company have designated DVN as a consensus moderate buy, with the average price target of $67.69 indicating a potential upside of over 22%.Pfizer (PFE)Pfizer logo on Pfizer building. Pfizer is an American pharmaceutical corporation.Source: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.comLast on our list of dividend-paying stocks to buy is none other than biotech giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE).There are several reasons investors should consider buying today, the most significant being its current plan to acquire Seagen. The acquisition, announced on Mar. 13, will see Pfizer purchasing the oncology drug developer for $43 billion in cash, with the funding generated from new debt. Seagen’s product portfolio is expected to generate $2.2 billion in revenue this year. By 2030, it is projected to generate approximately $10 billion in annual revenue, making it a lucrative investment for Pfizer.Indeed, Pfizer’s acquisition of Seagen will take time to impact the company’s revenue, as its sales guidance for 2023 is already high at up to $71 billion. However, the acquisition is expected to position Pfizer as a significant player in the oncology industry. Seagen’s product portfolio will bring in around $10 billion in annual revenue by 2030.Investors may be cautious about investing in PFE stock due to the expected decrease in vaccine demand. However, Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine has boosted the company’s financials, providing new avenues and possibilities. Its management team is projecting non-coronavirus sales of approximately one billion dollars by 2030, representing a solid 7% growth from 2019. Additionally, analysts predict sales will increase 74.6% from 2019 estimates by fiscal 2024.On the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.Chris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

This factor can impact your investment portfolio as well as help you compare investment results across sectors and industries.The fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.What if you'd invested in Oracle (ORCL) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to ORCL for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?Oracle's Business In-DepthWith that in mind, let's take a look at Oracle's main business drivers.Redwood City, CA-based Oracle Corporation was founded in 1977 and incorporated later in 2005. Oracle is one of the largest enterprise-grade database, middleware and application software providers.Oracle has expanded its cloud computing operations over the last couple of years. The company offers cloud solutions and services that can be used to build and manage various cloud deployment models.Built upon open industry standards such as SQL, Java and HTML5, Oracle Cloud provides access to application services, platform services and infrastructure services for a subscription. Through its Oracle Enterprise Manager offering, the company manages cloud environments.Oracle's software and hardware products and services include Oracle Database, Oracle Fusion Middleware, Java and Oracle Engineered Systems. Oracle Engineered Systems include Exadata Database Machine, Exalogic Elastic Cloud, Exalytics In-Memory Machine, SPARC SuperCluster, Virtual Compute Alliance, Oracle Database Appliance, Oracle Big Data Appliance and ZFS Storage.With the acquisition of Sun Microsystems in Jan 2010, Oracle began selling hardware products and services, primarily comprising computer server and storage products.Oracle reported revenues of $42.4 billion in fiscal 2022. The company reports its new software licenses under its new Cloud license and on-premise license segment. Further, the company merged its Cloud SaaS, Cloud PaaS and IaaS along with its software license updates and product support into Cloud services and license support.Total Cloud services and license support revenues came in at $30.2 billion in fiscal 2022. Total cloud license and on-premise license came in at $5.9 billion in fiscal 2022.Oracle faces significant competition in most of its operational markets (database, applications, storage, cloud computing) from the likes of Dell, IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft, SAP, salesforce.com, Workday and Teradata.Story continuesBottom LinePutting together a successful investment portfolio takes a combination of research, patience, and a little bit of risk. For Oracle, if you bought shares a decade ago, you're likely feeling really good about your investment today.A $1000 investment made in April 2013 would be worth $2,929.56, or a 192.96% gain, as of April 21, 2023, according to our calculations. Investors should note that this return excludes dividends but includes price increases.The S&amp;P 500 rose 165.54% and the price of gold increased 37.37% over the same time frame in comparison.Analysts are anticipating more upside for ORCL.Oracle is benefiting from the ongoing momentum across its cloud business, driven by the strong uptake of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure services and Autonomous Database offerings. Solid adoption of cloud-based applications, comprising NetSuite Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), Fusion ERP and Fusion Human Capital Management (HCM), bodes well. Solid demand for the Oracle Dedicated Region Cloud@Customer is anticipated to drive the top line. Partnerships with Accenture and Microsoft is helping Oracle win new clientele. The company’s share buybacks and dividend policy are noteworthy. However, higher spending on product enhancements, especially toward the cloud platform, amid increasing competition in the cloud domain is likely to limit margin expansion. We expect fiscal 2023 non-GAAP operating expenses to jump 14.1% over fiscal 2022.Over the past four weeks, shares have rallied 8.03%, and there have been 13 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2023 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

286,a5edb342-793e-3720-a2d9-b6c59d3de138,PSA,2023-04-22,The Top 7 Stocks to Buy for Income Investors,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-7-stocks-buy-income-103031727.html,1681900231,STORY,"['CNQ', 'SWK', 'VZ', 'BCH', 'DUK', 'MMM', 'PSA']","[The macroeconomic outlook remains highly uncertain but you still find some of the best income stocks that offer juicy yields and strong upside potential.The Federal Reserve continues its campaign to bring down inflation. The war rages on in Ukraine, and geopolitical tensions are mounting between the U.S. and China. Investors have a lot to worry about. Thankfully, with these income stocks to buy, investors can earn some serious yield while waiting for conditions to improve.One of the biggest struggles in investing is to keep emotions in check. Market volatility causes many people to make unforced errors. But by sticking to strong income stocks, a portfolio keeps generating cash regardless of what is happening in the world. This makes it easier to stay the course.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsWhat sorts of firms make the best sense to fill this role? These are seven of the best income stocks to buy now, and as a bonus, all offer a starting dividend yield of at least 4% at today’s prices.VZVerizon Communications$38.94DUKDuke Energy$97.41CNQCanadian Natural Resources$61.09MMM3M$106.27PSAPublic Storage$290.58SWKStanley Black &amp; Decker$80.94BCHBanco de Chile$20.46Verizon Communications (VZ)a Verizon storefront buildingSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) is one of the three large American mobile telecom providers. Traditionally, investors have gravitated to these as stable blue chips that pay reliable and large dividend streams.This view came into question last year as rival AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) slashed its dividend as part of its turnaround plans. VZ stock got swept up in the general negativity around the sector.However, investors should give Verizon another look. Its earnings are quite stable; analysts expect a less than 10% decline in earnings this year, followed by a return to profit growth for Verizon in 2024. Hardly a disaster.And yet Verizon shares are off by a third from their 2021 levels. That’s an overreaction. At today’s price, Verizon trades for less than 8.5 times forward earnings and offers a 6.6% dividend yield.Story continuesDuke Energy (DUK)The logo for Duke Energy (DUK) is seen on a sign at one of the company's offices.Source: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.comDuke Energy (NYSE:DUK) is one of the country’s largest utilities. It has a sizable position in Florida, which has been a fast-growing market which has delivered attractive returns on capital for local power generation firms.Florida also has offered excellent opportunities for Duke to deploy solar power generation at scale.The company is aiming to put $65 billion to work through 2027, with a ton of that going into clean energy. The way regulated utilities work, firms earn a fixed return on investment on these plans, giving Duke a clear runway for earnings and dividend growth in coming years.DUK stock has sold off 15% over the past year amid concerns around higher interest rates. This offers income investors an opportunity as Duke’s dividend yield has crept up to 4.1%.Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)Person holding the glowing world in their hands with icons with different types of energy. Energy stocks; energy storageSource: PopTika / ShutterstockCanadian Natural Resources (NYSE:CNQ) is one of Canada’s largest energy companies. Over the decades, it has built up its business primarily on the strength of the Alberta oil sands.When other players have wanted to exit that field, such as Devon (NYSE:DVN) a few years ago, Canadian Natural bought their assets at bargain prices.The oil sands are proving to be invaluable today. That’s because oil sands production functions more like traditional mining rather than an oil well.This means that oil sands have a far more predictable and stable production level than something like fracking, where production levels plunge over time. By contrast, analysts expect oil sands production, to continue rising well into the 2030s.This steady production function is essential now because there is so much opposition to new oil and gas drilling.With politicians, environmentalists, and ESG-driven investors all against new oil drilling, it’s increasingly difficult to bring new oil production to market. This gives a firm like Canadian Natural — whose assets can produce out into the 2050s — a tremendous position.Canadian Natural is also highly profitable; CNQ stock goes for just 9 times earnings. In addition to the dividend, the company is buying back huge piles of its own stock.With the price of oil on an upswing and the long-term supply picture looking uncertain, Canadian Natural’s large and long-lasting reserves should generate huge amounts of income for investors in the coming years.3M (MMM)3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stockSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com3M (NYSE:MMM) is an American manufacturing powerhouse. The firm has more than 90,000 employees and produces thousands of unique products across a dizzying area of fields ranging from safety helmets to automotive repair tools, dental equipment, adhesives, and dozens of others.In recent years, MMM stock has fallen sharply. Various factors have accounted for this including slow organic growth, product liability lawsuits, and concerns around the health of the overall economy.However, the sell-off has gone much too far. Shares now sell for just 12 times forward earnings and offer a nearly 6% dividend yield.That’s a great offer for such a blue chip American industrial giant as this one. 3M is also spinning off its healthcare business later this year which could be a catalyst for helping realize shareholder value.Public Storage (PSA)a Public Storage sign in front of a facility of storage buildingsSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.comThe self-storage industry has traditionally been one of the best categories in terms of total returns within the real estate investment trust (REITs) category.A big part of this is because storage is a recession-resistant category. People need a place to store their stuff regardless of what the economy is doing.In fact, recessions have a way of causing people to change their living conditions, which can drive incremental demand for additional storage capacity. While foreclosures and downsizing are bad news for most real estate, it isn’t anything for a storage investor to fear.Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) has been a tremendous performer over the decades. PSA stock has risen from $13 in 1993 to nearly $300 today, and that doesn’t even count the dividends.Public Storage is the industry leader, and it is currently on the hunt for more acquisitions which will further entrench its position.Shares have fallen recently around concerns around higher interest rates, but that’s nothing for long-term investors to worry about. Meanwhile, with the decline in the share price, PSA stock now yields 4.1%.Stanley Black &amp; Decker (SWK)Stanley Black and Decker (SWK) is a manufacturer of industrial tools and household hardware and provider of security productsSource: ricochet64 / Shutterstock.comStanley Black &amp; Decker (NYSE:SWK) is a leading maker of power tools and appliances. The company, like many, got caught up in the pandemic-driven boom/bust cycle.SWK stock soared in 2021 amid a surge in demand. People were doing home maintenance and repair projects at a record rate and bought Stanley Black &amp; Decker tools to aid those endeavors.Since then, however, demand has cooled. And since power tools are durable goods, many people that bought products in 2020 or 2021 won’t need any more Stanley Black &amp; Decker equipment for a while. Sales went from record highs to well below trend now.However, the market has punished SWK stock far too harshly, with shares trading down 50% from where they were prior to the onset of the pandemic. This is a wild move for a firm that has such a storied track record of earnings and dividend growth. On that latter point, Stanley Black &amp; Decker has increased its dividend for a stunning 55 years in a row, and shares now yield 4%.Banco de Chile (BCH)Piggy bank on a wooden table with stacks of coins next to it.Source: FabrikaSimf / ShutterstockBanco de Chile (NYSE:BCH) is the largest bank in Chile by market share. The case for owning Chilean banks is two-fold.One, Chile will become a central hub of the green revolution. Chile has among the world’s largest untapped reserves of both copper and lithium. To electrify cars and build batteries at scale, we’ll need far more of both materials. This should set off an 1849-style mining boom in Chile as it steps up to fill the need for these materials to power the green revolution.The second factor is that Latin American banks, including Banco de Chile, tend to earn far higher profit margins than U.S. banks. This is thanks to multiple reasons including less competition, higher market share, and lower compensation to employees as a proportion of revenues.BCH stock is still selling at a rock bottom valuation of just 5 times forward earnings while offering a juicy 11% dividend yield. Investors are understandably irritated with Chilean assets thanks to the limited economic growth over the past decade. But with the race for copper and lithium heating up, Chile is set to have a notable economic expansion, and its largest bank is set to profit.On the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in BCH, VZ, CNQ, MMM, SWK stock.

Now forecast comes despite US export restrictions on the latest chip making technologies.Meanwhile, the US is working to develop its chip making infrastructure. For more on the current direction of the semiconductor industry, let's get to Yahoo Finance's Ines Ferre. Hey, Ines.INES FERRE: Hey, Rochelle. Yeah, and those two companies, well known companies when it comes to manufacturing of semiconductors or the equipment to manufacture semiconductors are LAM Research that's based out of California, and also ASML Holdings and that's based out of the Netherlands.So they're both expecting strong demand coming out of China. Now, the US, last year, had announced that it was imposing some restrictions on exports into China of certain chips, and also manufacturing tools for those chips. But that involves the more advanced chips. So you still see chips that are going into the EV vehicles, for example. The demand for those are growing in China.And those are the types of chips that we're talking about when it comes to the Chinese customers for ASML and for LAM. When it comes to that strong demand that they are seeing, that will continue out of China. So LAM and ASML say that these Chinese customers are buying tools for building the less advanced chips, those chips that go into EVs, those chips that go into mobile phones that also go into laptops.And this is all happening really when you are seeing each region of the world or the major regions of the world, trying to become more self-sufficient when it comes to making chips because of the supply chain issues that we saw during the pandemic and also because of security concerns as well.Story continuesSo Europe just approved an EU Chips Act that's aimed at building capacity for building chips in and out of the EU, also making the EU just basically more self-sufficient in trying to avoid those supply chain issues that I just mentioned. As far as where the chip sector is going, analysts are seeing a recovery in the second half of 2023 after an inventory digestion. And you just had a Jefferies analyst that have a buy rating on LAM saying, investors are underestimating the potential for a v-shaped recovery, which is often what happens after a material inventory correction, Rochelle.- And then also honing in on TSMC, what do their latest results say about the chip space?INES FERRE: Yeah, basically, what they are-- they revised down their full year sales outlook, so they're expecting their revenue to be a little bit lower. But nevertheless, their CapEx is remaining unchanged. That's a capital expenditure. And so that bodes well for the equipment makers of the chip makers.So when you're taking a look at the overall sort of health of the industry, they do see that a stronger second half of the year, which kind of jives with what analysts are also saying. They're seeing a second stronger half for the year or so. They're expecting even stronger 2024, Rochelle.- Well, thank you for getting us up to speed on that. Our very own, Ines Ferre.]"
288,6e4f0510-354f-3298-92d6-a012b77cddb2,HAS,2023-04-22,Shareholders in Hasbro (NASDAQ:HAS) are in the red if they invested a year ago,Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholders-hasbro-nasdaq-red-invested-155549260.html,1682092549,STORY,['HAS'],"[Investors can approximate the average market return by buying an index fund. Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. Investors in Hasbro, Inc. (NASDAQ:HAS) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 42%. That falls noticeably short of the market decline of around 6.2%. At least the damage isn't so bad if you look at the last three years, since the stock is down 30% in that time. The falls have accelerated recently, with the share price down 19% in the last three months.Since shareholders are down over the longer term, lets look at the underlying fundamentals over the that time and see if they've been consistent with returns. Check out our latest analysis for Hasbro In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.Unfortunately Hasbro reported an EPS drop of 53% for the last year. The share price fall of 42% isn't as bad as the reduction in earnings per share. So the market may not be too worried about the EPS figure, at the moment -- or it may have expected earnings to drop faster.The graphic below depicts how EPS has changed over time (unveil the exact values by clicking on the image).earnings-per-share-growthWe like that insiders have been buying shares in the last twelve months. Having said that, most people consider earnings and revenue growth trends to be a more meaningful guide to the business. This free interactive report on Hasbro's earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further.What About Dividends?It is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. We note that for Hasbro the TSR over the last 1 year was -40%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.Story continuesA Different PerspectiveWhile the broader market lost about 6.2% in the twelve months, Hasbro shareholders did even worse, losing 40% (even including dividends). Having said that, it's inevitable that some stocks will be oversold in a falling market. The key is to keep your eyes on the fundamental developments. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 5% per year over five years.

The industry participants are also benefiting from partnerships with delivery channels and digital platforms. An increase in off-premise sales, which primarily include delivery, takeout, drive-thru, catering, meal kits and off-site options, such as kiosks and food trucks are also aiding the top line.Most restaurant operators are also gaining from the implementation of ghost or virtual kitchens. The idea of providing off-premise offerings and a connected curbside service is steadily garnering positive customer feedback.Industry players’ bottom line in the quarter is likely to have been hurt by high wages and food cost inflation. The industry is persistently bearing increased expenses, which have been affecting margins. Higher pre-opening costs, marketing expenses and costs related to sales-boosting initiatives are exerting pressure on the company’s margins. The rise in meat and seafood costs, including ribs, prime rib, ribeye and tri-tip and salmon, is hurting the industry.The latest Earnings Trend report suggests that the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s first-quarter earnings are expected to decline 5.9% from the year-ago period’s reported figure. The previous quarter witnessed a 29% decline. The sector’s revenues are projected to increase 4% compared with 6% reported in the previous quarter. However, margins are expected to decline 0.4%.Let us discuss the factors that might have played a key role in shaping the performance of the restaurant stocks in the third quarter.How to Make the Right Pick?Given the wide range of companies in this space, the task is by no means easy. While it is impossible to be sure of the outperformers, our proprietary methodology — a positive Earnings ESP along with a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) — makes it relatively simple. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP is our proprietary methodology for identifying stocks with high chances of delivering a surprise in their upcoming earnings announcements.

292,f0c50752-4661-35e9-9736-ff529c7aeb43,PLD,2023-04-22,10 Best REIT Stocks Under $10,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/10-best-reit-stocks-under-141337750.html,1682086417,STORY,"['SELF', 'AMT', 'EARN', 'ACRE', 'ARR', 'PLD', 'CCI']","[In this article, we discuss 10 best REIT stocks under $10. You can skip our detailed analysis of the REIT sector and its outlook, and go directly to read 5 Best REIT Stocks Under $10. A Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is a company that owns, operates, or finances income-generating real estate properties. REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders annually in the form of dividends, which makes them an attractive investment option for income-seeking investors. They provide a way for investors to invest in real estate without actually owning physical properties and offer diversification benefits to a portfolio. This has resulted in the growing popularity of REIT stocks among American investors. According to a report by Nareit, approximately 150 million Americans, or roughly 45% of American households have invested in REIT stocks directly or indirectly through mutual funds or exchange-traded funds.In 2022, high-interest rates and growing inflation affected the REIT sector as these economic conditions can also increase the borrowing costs of properties. This results in low profits and falling dividend payments for REIT companies. Last year’s returns also conform to this phenomenon as elevated interest rates caused the REIT sector to decline. The MSCI US REIT Index, which tracks the performance of publicly traded REITs, fell about  26% in 2022 through October 31, compared with a 16.5% decline in the S&amp;P 500 in this period.Despite a challenging period in 2022, analysts are giving a positive outlook for the REITs this year. Edward Pierzak, a senior Vice President of Research at Nareit, spoke with Wealth Management Real Estate about the sector’s position in 2023 so far. He said that though the economic conditions are challenging for the sector, the operational performance of the companies is seemingly more stable. Pierzak gave an insight into the sector’s balance sheet this year. He revealed that year-over-year FFO is up over 10% and net operating income is up 6.8%. Moreover, occupancy rates have also shown a 9.36% growth from the same period last year. This shows that the REIT sector is likely to perform well in 2023.Story continuesHistorical analysis of REIT stocks also shows that they have outperformed other asset classes over the years. In our article titled 11 Best REIT Dividend Stocks, we reported that REITs outperformed diversified core funds by 470 basis points annually over the past 30 years. The report also mentioned that the REIT sector delivered a 10.6% annual average return in the past 15 years, compared with a 6.5% return of the core funds during this period.As dividends are an essential component of the REIT sector, investors consider quality REIT companies with strong dividend policies. Some of the best dividend stocks from the REIT sector include American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), Prologis, Inc. (NYSE:PLD), and Crown Castle Inc. (NYSE:CCI).

Meanwhile, the key Eurozone indices are experiencing a slight uptick of around 10 basis points, with notable outperformance in the luxury, insurance, media, healthcare, energy, and utilities sectors. In contrast, basic resources, banks, retail, chemicals, and industrials are struggling. Basic resource stocks are taking a hit, with Rio Tinto, BHP, Anglo America, ArcelorMittal, and other major players experiencing a sharp decline of over 2%.The Fed tends to focus on its feet when evaluating economic strategies, and due to the absence of significant information before the May gathering, it appears more probable that an increase of 25 basis points will occur next month (Williams and Mester both hinted at another rate hike arriving on May 3). However, Powell's two primary indicators (employment and prices) are progressing in the intended direction at a hastened pace, implying that the US monetary policy will soon reach a more relaxed point, probably around a year-end Funds Rate estimate of 4.5-4.6%. In the most recent week, there was a minor uptick in borrowing at the Discount Window and the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP).The trend of declining inflation briefly halted during January and February. Still, it picked up again in March, and it appears to be gaining momentum in April (as demonstrated by the price-related elements of the Empire and Philadelphia reports). In other news related to rising prices, a recent article by Reuters advised major consumer goods companies to exercise caution in implementing price increases, as investors are concerned that they may lose market share to more affordable competitors.Story continuesOverall, the S&amp;P 500 Index constituents is expected to report a 5-6% decline in first quarter earnings. That's not a big number at all which is why the S&amp;P 500 Index has been unexpectedly resilient so far this year. According to Factset, analysts are actually projecting an earnings growth of 0.9% for the calendar year 2023 and the S&amp;P 500 Index currently has a forward PE ratio of around 18. Obviously, some companies will be negatively impacted by the Fed's interest rates policies and the macroeconomic developments in the market. In this article we will take a look at 10 stocks analysts are downgrading right now. For a list of recent analyst upgrades, please visit 10 Stocks Analysts are Upgrading.Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:CFG), Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc. (NYSE:BBWI),  and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) were among the notable stocks that were recently downgraded by analysts. Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:CFG) was downgraded due to the company's updated FY23 NII guidance, which failed to meet expectations, while ratings for Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc. (NYSE:BBWI) were cut due to ongoing margin pressures. Check out the complete article to see the details of these downgrades.Most Promising Micro-Cap Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by AlphaTradeZone10. CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21The self-storage industry has proven to be resilient regardless of economic conditions and is benefiting from the trend of decreasing home sizes. Americans tend to accumulate more possessions over time, which leads to continued demand for self-storage facilities. This industry has low barriers to entry and is dominated by a few large players, including CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE). CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) primarily operates in high-quality and established markets, with a significant portion of its income coming from the top 25 markets in the US. The company also targets densely populated areas with an average population of almost 200K within a 3-mile radius.On April 20, Keegan Carl, an analyst at Wolfe Research, downgraded CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) rating from Outperform to Peer Perform, without providing a specific price target. According to the analyst, the reason for the downgrade is the stock's valuation. However, the analyst has stated that the long-term outlook for CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) is still positive.09. Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) has experienced robust revenue growth, particularly in its Viator segment. Nevertheless, increasing expenses have been creating difficulties for the company's earnings. Analysts anticipate that the stock's growth may be limited in the near to mid-term.According to Truist's analyst Patrick Scholes, Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) earnings forecast for 2023, 2024, and 2025 has been revised downwards. The largest reduction in the estimate was for 2024, and due to limited visibility in the industry, no forecasts were given beyond 2025. Consequently, on April 20, the analyst downgraded Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) rating from Buy to Hold, and the stock's price target was cut from $40 to $21.08. Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32On April 20, Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC) was downgraded to Sell from Hold by Pito Chickering, a Deutsche Bank analyst, with a new price target of $63, down from $75. The analyst worries that the CTC business's methadone clinics could move from a 10% growth category to a slower-growing sector or even become a headwind due to a decline in opioid patients. While the firm holds the management of Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC) in high regard and is uncertain about the timing of the negative drivers, it believes investors should consider the short-term risks from Medicaid redetermination and the longer-term risk from the MAT Act's drag on the CTC business when assessing Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC).07. NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) provides IT storage solutions that offer software to help companies manage, safeguard, and optimize their data stored in cloud resources. Although the company is operating in a fast-growing industry, it seems to be struggling to progress. Even though NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) is returning more than 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders, its revenue is shrinking, which may cause its stock multiple to decrease over time. Although the company's strong balance sheet and commitment to returning free cash flow to investors are appealing, it is not meeting expectations. As a result, its stock multiple, such as P/E, could decrease going forward.NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) has been downgraded to Underperform from Neutral on April 20 by BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan, who has set a new price target of $58, down from $70. The analyst believes a weaker demand environment will hinder product revenue growth in FY24, although there will be some benefit to gross margins. However, due to reduced revenue, negative leverage is also expected. Furthermore, the firm argues that a slowdown in the public cloud will create a headwind through FY24.06. F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) has experienced a 30% drop in its share price due to a pessimistic industry outlook, exacerbated by persistent supply chain challenges. The company's balance sheet remains healthy, although some weaknesses have been revealed. Management has acknowledged that the sector will face headwinds that will impede revenue growth, coupled with economic uncertainties. Analysts doubt the company's high P/E ratio, recommending that investors exercise patience in a challenging environment that may result in further share price declines.The tech industry experienced significant growth during the pandemic as companies scrambled to adapt to remote working environments. This trend is expected to continue with the rise of hybrid working arrangements. However, the supply chain issues and uncertainties caused by the pandemic are still prevalent in 2023, casting a shadow over the industry's prospects. Despite these challenges, F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) liquidity remains robust, with a sizable cash reserve of $605 million and no outstanding debt. This financial position is desirable in the turbulent economic climate that many predict, although the timing and severity of any potential downturn remain uncertain.On April 20, F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) was downgraded from Overweight to Equal Weight by Barclays, with a new price target of $140, down from $166. Although the company's overall results for the March quarter were in line, there were significant shortfalls in the software segment, according to the analyst's research note to investors. Due to F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) inconsistent software segment and inadequate growth, the firm sees no potential upside for the shares and has downgraded its rating while also reducing its estimates.Click to continue reading and see Analysts Are Downgrading These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:12 Best Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy10 Undervalued Lithium Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Telecom Dividend Stocks To Buy for 2023Disclosure.

295,35770687-0bd5-3f75-841e-572f095d67e9,NWL,2023-04-22,Newell Brands (NWL) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Can the Stock Move Higher?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/newell-brands-nwl-expected-beat-140002285.html,1682085602,STORY,"['NWL', 'KMB']","[Newell Brands (NWL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price.The earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 28, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call, it's worth handicapping the probability of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis consumer products company is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.04 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -111.1%.Revenues are expected to be $1.79 billion, down 24.9% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 2.54% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Newell Brands?For Newell Brands, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +16%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that Newell Brands will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?While calculating estimates for a company's future earnings, analysts often consider to what extent it has been able to match past consensus estimates. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Newell Brands would post earnings of $0.12 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.16, delivering a surprise of +33.33%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates four times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.Newell Brands appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Consumer Products - Staples industry, Kimberly-Clark (KMB), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.35 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates no change from the year-ago quarter. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $5.07 billion, down 0.6% from the year-ago quarter.The consensus EPS estimate for Kimberly-Clark has been revised 3.4% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -0.07%.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Kimberly-Clark will beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Paccar (PCAR), which belongs to the Zacks Automotive - Domestic industry, could be a great candidate to consider.When looking at the last two reports, this truck maker has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 13.91%, on average, in the last two quarters.For the most recent quarter, Paccar was expected to post earnings of $1.49 per share, but it reported $1.76 per share instead, representing a surprise of 18.12%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.34 per share, while it actually produced $1.47 per share, a surprise of 9.70%.Price and EPS SurpriseFor Paccar, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank.Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven.The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Paccar has an Earnings ESP of +5.08% at the moment, suggesting that analysts have grown bullish on its near-term earnings potential. When you combine this positive Earnings ESP with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), it shows that another beat is possibly around the corner. The company's next earnings report is expected to be released on April 25, 2023.Story continuesWhen the Earnings ESP comes up negative, investors should note that this will reduce the predictive power of the metric. But, a negative value is not indicative of a stock's earnings miss.Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, but that may not be the sole basis for their stocks moving higher.

(NYSE:EPD) is still owned in the fund and remains one of our largest positions, as it has been since the partnership was founded. This has not been a great investment. Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.Since 2018, EPD’s dividend yield has gone from 6.5% to 8% with the annual per share payout growing from $1.72 to $1.96, +14%. The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow per share (what could be paid to us if management wanted to) has increased 22%, from $2.73 to $3.33, while leverage has come down a little over ½ a turn. So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio. We’ll continue to own this company unless the shares become meaningfully overvalued, and if it gets cheaper, we would be very comfortable owning more.”8. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.

That would mark the second straight quarterly fall for corporate earnings, a so-called ""earnings recession"" that last occurred when COVID-19 hit corporate results in 2020.So far, 76% of the 88 companies that have reported have beaten analysts' earnings expectations, compared with the 74% average for the past four reporting periods, based on Refinitiv data. Moreover, in aggregate, companies are reporting earnings 7.8% above expectations, compared with a 4.2% average for the prior four quarters.American Express was among the notable misses, while Tesla on Wednesday posted its lowest quarterly gross margin in two years.Story continuesMany economists still are predicting a U.S. recession at some point in 2023 or 2024, and some companies already have cut jobs in anticipation of a slowdown. Aggressive interest rate hikes from the Federal Reserve since last year to try to tame inflation have fueled the worries over a recession, while last month's collapse of two U.S. regional banks added fresh concerns.Still, some corporate leaders have recently suggested the U.S. economy may avoid a deep downturn.Baker Hughes Co. said in a presentation this week that the energy outlook remained constructive even with elevated recession risks.Both Delta and United gave upbeat near-term outlooks on travel demand, with Delta a week ago saying it expects summer travel demand will result in higher-than-expected profit for the quarter through June despite other risks.The chief executive of United, which reported results this week, said in a statement Tuesday that bookings for international travel are growing at twice the domestic rate.Meanwhile, Bank of America Chief Executive Officer Brian Moynihan told analysts following the firm's quarterly results this week that ""everything points to a relatively mild recession, given the amount of stimulus that was paid to people and the money they have left over.""(Reporting by Caroline Valetkevitch; additional reporting by Lance Tupper; Editing by Ira Iosebashvili and Jonathan Oatis)]"

The Dow Jones Industrial Average — aka the 'People's Index' — has tacked on 3.6% over that stretch. Bellwether stock Apple has charged ahead to the tune 15%.While the market's typically short memory has reared its ugly head, I can tell you that C-suite leaders haven't forgotten the trying moments in March. The bank runs outside Silicon Valley Bank remain vivid images amongst leaders, as do quick efforts by regulators to stem the crisis.Execs I have talked to in recent weeks have discussed the banking turmoil generally from three vantage points.First, many have used the opportunity to fine tune how they approach leading, employee, and investor communication.Sign up for the Yahoo Finance Morning Brief here.Along this line of thinking, American Express CEO Stephen Squeri tells me his business hasn't been super impacted by the events in March. That's a key message he is trying to get across to investors and other stakeholders.""The economy is definitely bifurcated, and I think at the lower end of the economy you are seeing some stress but we just don't have that,"" Squeri said, adding he is seeing strong demand for travel this spring and summer.Squeri also said Amex has seen increased deposit inflows post SVB.I suspect this business as usual vibe is something I will hear from Procter &amp; Gamble CEO Jon Moeller when we chat post earnings this morning (full interview airing on Yahoo Finance Live around 9 a.m.!).Meanwhile, management teams have re-combed through their financials to ensure they don't have any (or many...) skeletons buried that may blow up in financial system issues flare up again.Story continuesAnd lastly, execs have begun to put in place action items to run a little more efficiently given the economic quakes the turmoil created.I got that latter sense, at least, from AT&amp;T CFO Pascal Desroches (video above).""Look, it's a reminder that the last decade we have been living on abnormally low interest rates and probably broader credit availability than has been the historical norm. And when that happens, invariably you see the repercussions in things like Silicon Valley Bank. For us fortunately, we are in a position where we have taken significant actions over the last several years to de-lever our balance sheet,"" Desroches said on Yahoo Finance Live.Either way you slice it, while the banking mess in March may appear gone in the eyes of the market...it's really not.One major player on Wall Street told me this week he has his portfolio managers building out models that profit if we get at least three more rate hikes this year. It's plausible given where inflation is, and a factor the market isn't even thinking about if you look at the very low VIX Index or the push higher in tech stocks.The C-suite...and markets should stay on high alert.Brian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

If you want to see more such stocks on the list, you can directly visit Analysts Are Downgrading These 5 Stocks.The US equity futures market exhibits little movement in all three indices (S&amp;P, Dow, and Nasdaq) as of April 21. Meanwhile, the key Eurozone indices are experiencing a slight uptick of around 10 basis points, with notable outperformance in the luxury, insurance, media, healthcare, energy, and utilities sectors. In contrast, basic resources, banks, retail, chemicals, and industrials are struggling. Basic resource stocks are taking a hit, with Rio Tinto, BHP, Anglo America, ArcelorMittal, and other major players experiencing a sharp decline of over 2%.The Fed tends to focus on its feet when evaluating economic strategies, and due to the absence of significant information before the May gathering, it appears more probable that an increase of 25 basis points will occur next month (Williams and Mester both hinted at another rate hike arriving on May 3). However, Powell's two primary indicators (employment and prices) are progressing in the intended direction at a hastened pace, implying that the US monetary policy will soon reach a more relaxed point, probably around a year-end Funds Rate estimate of 4.5-4.6%. In the most recent week, there was a minor uptick in borrowing at the Discount Window and the Bank Term Funding Program (BTFP).The trend of declining inflation briefly halted during January and February. Still, it picked up again in March, and it appears to be gaining momentum in April (as demonstrated by the price-related elements of the Empire and Philadelphia reports). In other news related to rising prices, a recent article by Reuters advised major consumer goods companies to exercise caution in implementing price increases, as investors are concerned that they may lose market share to more affordable competitors.Story continuesOverall, the S&amp;P 500 Index constituents is expected to report a 5-6% decline in first quarter earnings. That's not a big number at all which is why the S&amp;P 500 Index has been unexpectedly resilient so far this year. According to Factset, analysts are actually projecting an earnings growth of 0.9% for the calendar year 2023 and the S&amp;P 500 Index currently has a forward PE ratio of around 18. Obviously, some companies will be negatively impacted by the Fed's interest rates policies and the macroeconomic developments in the market.

(NASDAQ:TSLA) were among the notable stocks that were recently downgraded by analysts. Citizens Financial Group, Inc. (NYSE:CFG) was downgraded due to the company's updated FY23 NII guidance, which failed to meet expectations, while ratings for Bath &amp; Body Works, Inc. (NYSE:BBWI) were cut due to ongoing margin pressures. Check out the complete article to see the details of these downgrades.Most Promising Micro-Cap Stocks According to AnalystsPhoto by AlphaTradeZone10. CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 21The self-storage industry has proven to be resilient regardless of economic conditions and is benefiting from the trend of decreasing home sizes. Americans tend to accumulate more possessions over time, which leads to continued demand for self-storage facilities. This industry has low barriers to entry and is dominated by a few large players, including CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE). CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) primarily operates in high-quality and established markets, with a significant portion of its income coming from the top 25 markets in the US. The company also targets densely populated areas with an average population of almost 200K within a 3-mile radius.On April 20, Keegan Carl, an analyst at Wolfe Research, downgraded CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) rating from Outperform to Peer Perform, without providing a specific price target. According to the analyst, the reason for the downgrade is the stock's valuation. However, the analyst has stated that the long-term outlook for CubeSmart (NYSE:CUBE) is still positive.09. Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 31Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) has experienced robust revenue growth, particularly in its Viator segment. Nevertheless, increasing expenses have been creating difficulties for the company's earnings. Analysts anticipate that the stock's growth may be limited in the near to mid-term.According to Truist's analyst Patrick Scholes, Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) earnings forecast for 2023, 2024, and 2025 has been revised downwards. The largest reduction in the estimate was for 2024, and due to limited visibility in the industry, no forecasts were given beyond 2025. Consequently, on April 20, the analyst downgraded Tripadvisor, Inc. (NASDAQ:TRIP) rating from Buy to Hold, and the stock's price target was cut from $40 to $21.08. Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32On April 20, Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC) was downgraded to Sell from Hold by Pito Chickering, a Deutsche Bank analyst, with a new price target of $63, down from $75. The analyst worries that the CTC business's methadone clinics could move from a 10% growth category to a slower-growing sector or even become a headwind due to a decline in opioid patients. While the firm holds the management of Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC) in high regard and is uncertain about the timing of the negative drivers, it believes investors should consider the short-term risks from Medicaid redetermination and the longer-term risk from the MAT Act's drag on the CTC business when assessing Acadia Healthcare Company, Inc. (NASDAQ:ACHC).07. NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 32NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) provides IT storage solutions that offer software to help companies manage, safeguard, and optimize their data stored in cloud resources. Although the company is operating in a fast-growing industry, it seems to be struggling to progress. Even though NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) is returning more than 100% of its free cash flow to shareholders, its revenue is shrinking, which may cause its stock multiple to decrease over time. Although the company's strong balance sheet and commitment to returning free cash flow to investors are appealing, it is not meeting expectations. As a result, its stock multiple, such as P/E, could decrease going forward.NetApp, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTAP) has been downgraded to Underperform from Neutral on April 20 by BofA analyst Wamsi Mohan, who has set a new price target of $58, down from $70. The analyst believes a weaker demand environment will hinder product revenue growth in FY24, although there will be some benefit to gross margins. However, due to reduced revenue, negative leverage is also expected. Furthermore, the firm argues that a slowdown in the public cloud will create a headwind through FY24.06. F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 33F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) has experienced a 30% drop in its share price due to a pessimistic industry outlook, exacerbated by persistent supply chain challenges. The company's balance sheet remains healthy, although some weaknesses have been revealed. Management has acknowledged that the sector will face headwinds that will impede revenue growth, coupled with economic uncertainties. Analysts doubt the company's high P/E ratio, recommending that investors exercise patience in a challenging environment that may result in further share price declines.The tech industry experienced significant growth during the pandemic as companies scrambled to adapt to remote working environments. This trend is expected to continue with the rise of hybrid working arrangements. However, the supply chain issues and uncertainties caused by the pandemic are still prevalent in 2023, casting a shadow over the industry's prospects. Despite these challenges, F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) liquidity remains robust, with a sizable cash reserve of $605 million and no outstanding debt. This financial position is desirable in the turbulent economic climate that many predict, although the timing and severity of any potential downturn remain uncertain.On April 20, F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) was downgraded from Overweight to Equal Weight by Barclays, with a new price target of $140, down from $166. Although the company's overall results for the March quarter were in line, there were significant shortfalls in the software segment, according to the analyst's research note to investors. Due to F5, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV) inconsistent software segment and inadequate growth, the firm sees no potential upside for the shares and has downgraded its rating while also reducing its estimates.Click to continue reading and see Analysts Are Downgrading These 5 Stocks.Suggested articles:12 Best Warren Buffett Stocks To Buy10 Undervalued Lithium Stocks to Buy Now10 Best Telecom Dividend Stocks To Buy for 2023Disclosure.

306,9dc05a3c-53ea-3cb5-9006-c623b19df156,FTI,2023-04-22,NOV Q1 Earnings Preview: Here's Everything You Need to Know,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nov-q1-earnings-preview-heres-141702575.html,1682086622,STORY,"['NOV', 'MPC', 'FTI', 'CNQ']","[NOV Inc. NOV is set to release first-quarter results on Apr 26. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 22 cents per share on revenues of $2 billion.Let’s delve into the factors that might have influenced the oilfield service provider’s performance in the March quarter. But it’s worth taking a look at NOV’s previous-quarter results first.Highlights of Q4 Earnings &amp; Surprise HistoryIn the last reported quarter, the Houston, TX-based oil and gas equipment company beat the consensus mark on an improving momentum in the international markets. NOV had reported net income per share of 26 cents, above the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 23 cents. Revenues of $2.1 billion also came in 6.5% above the consensus mark.NOV beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings twice in the last four quarters and missed in the other two, resulting in an earnings surprise of 27.4%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:NOV Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNOV Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseNOV Inc. price-eps-surprise | NOV Inc. Quote Trend in Estimate RevisionThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter bottom line has remained unchanged in the past seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 269.2% jump year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 26.4% increase from the year-ago period.Factors to ConsiderOne of NOV’s key segments — Rig Technologies — is expected to have benefited from impressive sales of offshore wind turbine installation vessel packages and growing demand for its aftermarket operations during the first quarter of 2023. As a result of this improved operating environment, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the first-quarter revenues of Rig Technologies is pegged at $534 million, indicating an increase of 21.1% from the year-ago period.NOV is also expected to have benefited from a powerful performance from its Wellbore Technologies unit, with more drilling work, improved pricing and better execution. As a reflection of this, the consensus mark for first-quarter Wellbore Technologies revenues stands at $764 million, suggesting a rise of 25.7% from the corresponding period of 2022.On a somewhat bearish note, the increase in NOV’s costs might have dented the company’s to-be-reported bottom line. The company’s fourth-quarter cost of goods sold totaled $1.6 billion, up 24% from the year-ago period. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the first quarter due to the prevailing inflationary environment.Story continuesWhat Does Our Model Say?The proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that NOV is likely to beat estimates in the first quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. But that’s not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, for this company is -1.23%.Zacks Rank: NOV currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.Stocks to ConsiderWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for NOV, here are some firms from the energy space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:Marathon Petroleum MPC has an Earnings ESP of +11.24% and a Zacks Rank #1.

This is depicted in the graph below:EQT Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseEQT Corporation Price and EPS SurpriseEQT Corporation price-eps-surprise | EQT Corporation QuoteEstimate TrendThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter earnings per share of $1.37 has witnessed three upward movements and 10 downward revisions over the past 60 days. The estimated figure suggests a 69.1% improvement from the prior-year reported number.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for first-quarter revenues of $1.99 billion indicates a 26.7% increase from the year-ago reported figure.Factors to NoteCompared to the prior-year quarter, the pricing scenario of natural gas was not healthier. Hence, it is likely that EQT’s upstream operations, focused on the gas-rich Appalachian Basin, were not as favorable as in the year-ago quarter. This is expected to have lowered gas equivalent production. In the March quarter, we expect EQT to have produced 474,313.9 million cubic feet equivalent, suggesting a year-over-year decline.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not indicate an earnings beat for EQT this time around.

309,04db5bff-cc0c-378a-8adc-83f95217ad3c,TSCO,2023-04-22,How to Boost Your Portfolio with Top Retail-Wholesale Stocks Set to Beat Earnings,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/boost-portfolio-top-retail-wholesale-130001921.html,1682082001.0,STORY,['TSCO'],"[Quarterly financial reports play a vital role on Wall Street, as they help investors see how a company has performed and what might be coming down the road in the near-term. And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Bloomin' Brands (BLMN) earns a Zacks Rank #3 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.91 a share, just seven days from its upcoming earnings release on April 28, 2023.Bloomin' Brands' Earnings ESP sits at 3.61%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.91 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.88.BLMN is one of just a large database of Retail-Wholesale stocks with positive ESPs. Another solid-looking stock is Tractor Supply (TSCO).Tractor Supply is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock, and is getting ready to report earnings on April 27, 2023. TSCO's Most Accurate Estimate sits at $1.70 a share six days from its next earnings release.Story continuesThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Tractor Supply is $1.69, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 0.3%.BLMN and TSCO's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

310,310d77ae-6902-35b6-84d6-6346bf49fc2a,MDLZ,2023-04-22,7 Defensive Stocks to Buy to Batten Down the Hatches,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-defensive-stocks-buy-batten-191057898.html,1681845057,STORY,"['MS', 'ABI', 'SRE', 'FIVE', 'MDLZ', 'BJ', 'BUD', 'EL', 'CAG']","[Although a much-debated topic, investors should at least consider shifting toward defensive stocks to buy ahead of a potential downcycle. Notably, Morgan Stanley analysts warned about U.S. recession risks prior to 2023. Naturally, these fears only accelerated due to the recent bank failures.If that wasn’t enough, the Federal Reserve has a bear of a time containing historically high inflation. Unfortunately, the alliance between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-member oil-producing nations — known as OPEC+ — imposed a surprise production cut, leading to higher crude prices. Therefore, it’s only sensible to consider the best defensive stocks.Of course, one could always choose to be out of the market altogether. However, for those that want to stay, these defensive stocks to buy may offer significant protection because of their relevance.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFIVEFive Below$204.02MDLZMondelez$70.50SRESempra Energy$155.87BJBJ’s Wholesale Club$74.50CAGConagra Brands$37.16ELEstee Lauder$257.58BUDAnheuser-Busch Inbev$64.37Five Below (FIVE)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comAn American chain of specialty discount stores Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) ranks among the defensive stocks to buy due to its ability to meet consumers’ needs, particularly at an increasingly desperate time. What makes Five Below distinct from other discount retailers centers on pricing diversity. Here, we’re not talking about junk products for a buck. Rather, customers can find eclectic items up to $25.Financially, Five Below facilitates confidence among investors seeking the best defensive stocks. First, the retailer carries decent stability in the balance sheet. Its Altman Z-Score pings at 5.41, indicating fiscal resilience and low bankruptcy risk.Operationally, Five Below features a three-year revenue growth rate of 18.8%, outpacing 81.47% of companies listed in the cyclical retail industry. On the bottom line, its net margin comes out to 8.5%, above nearly 82% of its peers. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg FIVE as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target lands at $224.67, implying 9% upside potential.Story continuesMondelez (MDLZ)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA relatively easy idea among defensive stocks to buy, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a multinational confectionary, food and beverage, and snack company. Fundamentally, stressed-out consumers may look for cheap pick-me-ups during a recession. For that, Mondelez’s many tempting brands could fit the bill. Since the start of this year, MDLZ gained over 5% of its equity value.Financially, the company presents a mix of differing characteristics. Right off the bat, Mondelez could use some work with its balance sheet. For example, its cash-to-debt ratio ranks much lower than other safe stocks listed in the packaged goods sector. On the other hand, its operational stats impress. Notably, Mondelez’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 8.6%, above 61.69% of its peers. On the bottom line, its net margin touches down at 8.63%, outpacing almost 76% of the competition.Lastly, covering analysts peg MDLZ as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $76.36, implying over 9% upside potential.Sempra Energy (SRE)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA public utility holding company based in San Diego, California, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) arguably represents a go-to among the top defensive stocks to buy. Fundamentally, Sempra – like other public utilities – benefits from a natural monopoly. Basically, with such a steep barrier to entry, would-be competitors don’t even try. As well, Sempra symbolizes the “tax” residents must pay to live in sunny California.Despite what you hear on partisan programming, people love California because frankly, you’re not going to find Golden State weather in other parts of the country. Therefore, I’m not concerned about Sempra’s less-than-robust balance sheet. The net demand for life in California – especially SoCal – more than makes up for any shortfalls. Also, where Sempra’s strengths shine is in profitability. Its net margin pings at 14.81%, outpacing 74.57% of its peers. Thus, it’s one of the resilient stocks despite some not-so-great stats.In closing, analysts peg SRE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $168.11, implying nearly 10% upside potential.BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7With stubbornly high inflation hitting consumers hard, some of the best defensive stocks to buy stem from the big-box retailers. However, I’ve already talked about the usual suspects so it’s time to shine the spotlight on BJ’s Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ). A membership-only warehouse club chain, BJ’s features similar fundamentals to that other membership-only warehouse club. Basically, bulk purchases help mitigate the sting of inflation.Financially, BJ’s presents a solid profile, making it an ideal choice among recession-resistant stocks. On the balance sheet, BJ’s features an Altman Z-Score of 4.52. Again, this stat reflects high stability and low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the retailer posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 14.3%. This stat ranks above 83.39% of companies listed in the defensive retail industry. Also, its net margin comes out to 2.66%, beating out nearly 65% of sector rivals.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg BJ as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $82.36, implying nearly 12% upside potential.Conagra Brands (CAG)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAn American consumer packaged goods holding company, Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) makes and sells products under various brand names that are available in supermarkets, restaurants, and food service establishments. Naturally, Conagra ranks among the top defensive stocks to buy because it feeds a critical human need. We, humans, don’t perform so well without a daily minimum intake of calories.Financially, it must be stated that Conagra doesn’t quite feature the same magnitude of green ink as other recession-resistant stocks. Perhaps most problematic when it comes to the balance sheet, Conagra’s cash-to-debt ratio sits at 0.01. That’s crazy low for the consumer packaged goods industry and frankly other sectors.However, Conagra enjoys a solid net margin of 6.59%. Also, the market prices CAG at a forward multiple of 12.84. As a discount to projected earnings, Conagra ranks better than 70.14% of the competition. Looking to the Street, analysts peg CAG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $41.92, implying over 13% upside potential.Estee Lauder (EL)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAn American multinational cosmetics company, Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) is a manufacturer and marketer of makeup, skincare, fragrance, and hair care products. While it might not be everyone’s first idea for defensive stocks to buy, Estee Lauder could be quite relevant. In particular, with companies recalling their workers back to the office, the incentive to look presentable accelerates. That should be net beneficial for EL.Another reason to consider EL as one of the recession-resistant stocks centers on its financials. While it doesn’t enjoy the strongest balance sheet ever, the cosmetics giant features an Altman Z-Score of 6.19, reflecting robust resilience against potentially incoming headwinds. Operationally, the company features an okay three-year revenue growth rate of 6.6%. However, this stat might rise with the back-to-office movement. Also, its net margin pings at 9.13%, beating out 77.25% of its peers.Finally, analysts peg EL as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $290.50, implying over 14% upside potential.Anheuser-Busch (BUD)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comTheoretically offering consumers some liquid relief, Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) got into some hot water recently because of its partnership with a social media star. Long story short, conservative commentators objected to Anheuser’s Bud Light brand working with Dylan Mulvaney, a TikTok star who documented her gender transition journey. To be fair, the move seems risky because consumer demographics data reveals that Republicans more so than Democrats prefer light beer brands, including Bud Light.However, as I wrote for Fintel, other companies generated far worse controversies, scandals that actually hurt millions of households. Yet, those enterprises did just fine in the end and that might be the case for Anheuser. Financially, the metrics undergirding BUD stock could use some work. However, Anheuser is profitable, featuring a net margin of 10.33%. This stat ranks better than 66.18% of its peers, making BUD one of the top defensive stocks to buy.Lastly, analysts peg BUD as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $74.67, implying almost 16% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Best Fast Money Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.""Trendlines Over Headlines""On April 12 Piper Sandler's chief market technician, Craig Johnson, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he discussed the current market situation and his market outlook. According to Johnson, the market is going to undergo 3 phases: ""a hop, and drop, and a pop"", and right now we are in a ""hop"" phase. According to Johnson, the S&amp;P 500 has the potential to trade up to anywhere between 4,200 and 4,300 during the ""hop"" phase. As for the ""drop"" phase, Johnson expects the market to decline when the Fed decides to cut interest rates, which he expects will happen in the middle of 2023 or possibly in the third quarter of 2023.Craig Johnson noted that ""great downturn reversals have already occurred"" over the past 24 months on the Dow, the S&amp;P 500, the NASDAQ, the Russell 2000, and the Dow Jones Transportation Average as well. According to Craig Johnson, we have had ""a series of higher highs and higher lows"" and when we look at the lows that were made in September and October 2022, we observe that at that point in time the market was extremely oversold. Here are some comments from Craig Johnson:""If you come back and you look at history, all the way back to 1929, when you look at the fact that we haven't seen in the first quarter (of 2023) a break back below the December lows of last year (2022). That has historically been a pretty bullish sign for the market. In fact, when you look back in time, the market is typically 83% of the time higher, with about 13.7% annual return, when you don't break back below those December lows in the first quarter of the new year. And that's exactly what we are seeing happen this year.""Story continuesWhile the markets may undergo a correction, according to Craig Johnson, investors should focus on the long term for 2023. Craig Johnson expects the S&amp;P 500 to move up to 4,625 by the end of the year. Here is what Craig Johnson of Piper Sandler said:""If you look at some of the underlying indices, clearly, it is trendlines over headlines at this point in time... All the negativity out there at this point in time, stocks aren't going down. They're starting to trend higher and we really need to pay attention to that fact.""Craig Johnson thinks that the National Bureau of Economic Research will officially declare a recession in the back half of 2023. He noted that once a recession is official, ""history shows that you typically backdate that recession's start date by about 7.6 months"". Out of all the recessions since 1929, it was only in 2002 that the market did not bottom, said Johnson, and he thinks that after the market bottoms the S&amp;P 500 will ""pop"" back to 4,625.Craig Johnson further noted that he sees the Fed starting to cut interest rates in July 2023, or possibly after that, and this will lead to a ""quick drop"" in the markets. Craig Johnson talked about investor positioning right now and said:""We're at levels right now that we have seen only at the lows of the market in 2020, 2011, and 2007. The world is already very negatively positioned, and any drop will get bought from our perspective.""While Craig Johnson's market outlook offers valuable insights into the broader market, investors can also consider the individual stocks recommended by Fast Money traders to identify potential near-term opportunities. Fast Money is a popular TV show on CNBC that offers daily stock picks and market insights from a group of experienced traders. However, these traders provide valuable insights into individual stocks and sectors that are likely to outperform in the short term.

While the company remains a unique and resilient franchise, China is a very important growth market for the company, and zero-COVID policies have made it challenging for the company to operate in this important market. While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses.

The Santa Clara, California-based company has a device that uses sound waves to break up calcium deposits in arteries and expand vessels, a method the company says is safer than some currently used procedures.Boston Scientific, which has a market value of about $76 billion, makes a number of devices and instruments used in cardiac care.Acquiring Shockwave would make “a lot of strategic sense given the company’s focus in interventional cardiology and peripheral vascular though we do acknowledge BSX would likely need to pay a sizable valuation to acquire the asset and this deal may or may not introduce some FTC considerations,” Piper Sandler analysts led by Adam C.

316,bac9d766-2a3a-349b-8c9e-8e9b6b77cf38,COF,2023-04-22,How to fix bitter coffee with a surprising ingredient,USA TODAY,https://finance.yahoo.com/m/bac9d766-2a3a-349b-8c9e-8e9b6b77cf38/how-to-fix-bitter-coffee-with.html,1682085391,STORY,['KC=F'],"[Brewing coffee is a science and an art, and there's a fine line between too bitter and just right. Coffee is inherently bitter due to its caffeine content. In general, children don't like coffee for that very reason. But as we grow into adulthood, many of us learn to override the bitter flavors to cash in on the benefits. We like the energy boost a cup of coffee can provide, the aroma of brewing beans, and the social aspects of sharing a warm drink in a convivial atmosphere. All that being said, there are boundaries. And an excessively bitter cup of coffee is likely to prompt pursed lips in the most ardent coffee drinker.Watch the video to learn how to make coffee less bitterWhy is my coffee so bitter?Only 10-15 percent of coffee's bitterness comes from caffeine. Indeed, if the bitterness of your coffee is unacceptable, the problem may well be low-grade beans or a bad brewing technique. Buying low-quality beans will inevitably affect the taste of your brew. Beans that are a mixture of ripe and unripe coffee cherries, defective beans damaged by things like fungus or insects, or beans that are just too old, can all produce an intolerable degree of bitterness.Of course, the higher the grade of coffee you use, the less the chance of your cup of Joe being bitter. However, even top-quality coffee can become unpalatable if you don't get the science right. Mistakes include:Using the wrong sized beans. Grinding coffee beans changes how the flavor compounds dissolve. If they're too finely ground, the result may be a bitter-tasting brew.Brewing your beans for too long, essentially overcooking them.Making the water too hot. According to the National Coffee Association, 195°F to 205°F is the ideal temperature for optimal extraction.Using dirty coffee-making equipment so that all the nasties that accumulate inside affect the taste of your drink.How does salt make coffee less bitter?Bitter coffee can be fixed to a certain extent by adding a dash of salt to your brew. The salt essentially acts as a masking agent. The bitterness itself doesn't actually go away, but the salt inhibits our ability to detect it. That's an excellent band-aid solution. But of course, as with everything, when it comes to bitter coffee, prevention is better than cure.Story continuesReviewed-approved kitchen and cooking recommendations:Purchases you make through our links may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.Reviewed helps you find the best stuff and get the most out of what you already own.

In the last reported quarter, VRTX delivered a positive earnings surprise of 6.52%.This large-cap biotech’s performance has been impressive, with its earnings beating estimates in three of the trailing four quarters but missing the mark in one. Vertex has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 4.11%, on average.Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS Surprise Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Price, Consensus and EPS SurpriseVertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Vertex Pharmaceuticals Incorporated Quote In the year so far, shares of Vertex have risen 14.0% against the industry’s 4.0% decline.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchLet’s see how things are shaping up for the quarter to be reported.Factors to ConsiderVertex’s revenue growth in first-quarter 2023 is likely to have been driven by a rapid uptake of its blockbuster cystic fibrosis (CF) medicine Trikafta/Kaftrio (Trikafta’s brand name in Europe). The Zacks Consensus Estimate and our model estimates for Trikafta sales are pegged at $2.05 billion and $2.04 billion, respectively.Trikafta’s sales in the to-be-reported quarter are likely to have been driven bystrong uptakes in international markets and increased drug adoption in the United States among pediatric patients (6-11 years of age). Higher Trikafta sales are likely to have caused sales erosion of Vertex’s other CF drugs and existing combinations, namely Kalydeco, Orkambi and Symdeko/Symkevi.Last December, the FDA accepted the company’s IND applicationseeking to start clinical studies on VX-522, an investigational mRNA-based therapy for CF indication. With this therapy, management intends to target a patient populationwho still cannot benefit from its four marketed CF medicines. Investors will likely seek updates on the phase I study on VX-522, which was expected to start early this year. VX-522 is being developed in collaboration with Moderna.Story continuesInvestors will also expect an update on Vertex’s non-CF pipeline during first-quarter conference call.As part of its collaboration with CRISPR Therapeutics CRSP, Vertex developed exagamglogene autotemcel (“exa-cel”), an investigational ex-vivo CRISPR gene-edited therapy for two indications, namely sickle cell disease (“SCD”) and transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (“TDT”).Vertex expects exa-cel to be its next commercial launch.Earlier this month, Vertex and partner CRISPR Therapeutics announced the completion of the rolling biologics license application (BLA) submission to the FDA seeking approval for exa-cel in SCD and TDT indications. CRISPR Therapeutics and Vertex have also filed similar regulatory submissions for exa-cel in Europe, which were validated this January.Last month, Vertex signed a new non-exclusive licensing agreement with CRISPR Therapeutics for the use of the latter’s gene-editing technology to accelerate the development of its hypoimmune cell therapies for type I diabetes (T1D). Per the terms of the agreement, Vertex is liable to pay CRISPR an upfront amount of $100 million for the non-exclusive rights to the latter’s technology for the development of hypoimmune gene-edited cell therapies for T1D. CRISPR Therapeutics is also entitled to additional payments of up to $230 million in research and development milestones and receive royalties on any future products resulting from this agreement.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not predict an earnings beat for Vertex this time around.

323,af360801-e0df-3d57-a49f-6f69e7bb1c56,NSC,2023-04-22,"How Good Is Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC), When It Comes To ROE?",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/good-norfolk-southern-corporation-nyse-150609735.html,1682089569,STORY,['NSC'],"[One of the best investments we can make is in our own knowledge and skill set. With that in mind, this article will work through how we can use Return On Equity (ROE) to better understand a business. To keep the lesson grounded in practicality, we'll use ROE to better understand Norfolk Southern Corporation (NYSE:NSC).Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders. See our latest analysis for Norfolk Southern How To Calculate Return On Equity?The formula for return on equity is:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Norfolk Southern is:26% = US$3.3b ÷ US$13b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2022).The 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.26 in profit.Does Norfolk Southern Have A Good Return On Equity?One simple way to determine if a company has a good return on equity is to compare it to the average for its industry. However, this method is only useful as a rough check, because companies do differ quite a bit within the same industry classification. If you look at the image below, you can see Norfolk Southern has a similar ROE to the average in the Transportation industry classification (25%).roeThat's neither particularly good, nor bad. Although the ROE is similar to the industry, we should still perform further checks to see if the company's ROE is being boosted by high debt levels. If so, this increases its exposure to financial risk.Why You Should Consider Debt When Looking At ROEVirtually all companies need money to invest in the business, to grow profits. The cash for investment can come from prior year profits (retained earnings), issuing new shares, or borrowing. In the first two cases, the ROE will capture this use of capital to grow. In the latter case, the debt required for growth will boost returns, but will not impact the shareholders' equity. In this manner the use of debt will boost ROE, even though the core economics of the business stay the same.Story continuesCombining Norfolk Southern's Debt And Its 26% Return On EquityIt's worth noting the high use of debt by Norfolk Southern, leading to its debt to equity ratio of 1.23. Its ROE is pretty impressive but, it would have probably been lower without the use of debt. Debt increases risk and reduces options for the company in the future, so you generally want to see some good returns from using it.SummaryReturn on equity is a useful indicator of the ability of a business to generate profits and return them to shareholders. A company that can achieve a high return on equity without debt could be considered a high quality business. If two companies have around the same level of debt to equity, and one has a higher ROE, I'd generally prefer the one with higher ROE.But when a business is high quality, the market often bids it up to a price that reflects this. The rate at which profits are likely to grow, relative to the expectations of profit growth reflected in the current price, must be considered, too. So I think it may be worth checking this free report on analyst forecasts for the company.Of course Norfolk Southern may not be the best stock to buy.

Edging closer to its 52-week highs the beverage giant currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with its Beverage-Soft Drink Industry in the top 19% of over 250 Zacks industries.Q1 Preview: Coca-Cola’s Q1 earnings are expected to be up 1% from the prior year quarter at $0.65 per share. First-quarter sales are forecasted to rise 3% year over year at $10.87 billion. Plus, earnings estimate revisions have slightly gone up over the last quarter.The bottom line growth of Coca-Cola is still steady with earnings now expected to rise 5% this year and jump another 7% in FY24 at $2.79 per share. Total sales are forecasted to be up 4% this year and rise another 5% in FY24 to $47.16 billion.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchCadence Design Systems (CDNS)Also standing out before its Q1 earnings is Cadence Design Systems with a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and the Computer-Software Industry in the top 39% of all Zacks industries.  Providing tools that help customers design electronic products, Cadence''s offerings appear to be in higher demand. Cadence offers software, hardware, services and reusable IC design blocks (IPs) to electronic systems and semiconductor customers.Q1 Preview: First-quarter earnings are projected to be up 7% YoY at $1.25 per share with sales forecasted to rise 11% to $1.01 billion. Notably and very impressive, Cadence has beaten earnings expectations for 22 consecutive quarters and topped sales estimates in its last 24 quarterly reports.  Even better, annual earnings are anticipated to jump 16% this year and pop another 7% in FY24 at $5.34 per share. Earnings estimate revisions have noticeably gone up, rising 9% for FY23 over the last 90 days and up 6% for FY24.Story continuesZacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchChugai Pharmaceuticals (CHGCY)Lastly, Chugai Pharmaceuticals sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and is a lesser-known name that investors should pay attention to. Chugai’s Medical-Drug Industry is also in the top 39% of Zacks industries.The Tokyo-based company’s first-quarter earnings could help confirm its stellar earnings growth. Chugai appears to be building a necessary niche in the healthcare field as a provider of pharmaceutical products for kidney diseases, kidney transplantation, bone and joint diseases, and cancer treatment. Q1 Preview:  Impressively, Chugai’s Q1 earnings are forecasted to climb 100% YoY at $0.68 per share compared to EPS of $0.34 in the prior year quarter. This is even more impressive considering sales are projected to decline -29% at $2.20 billion compared to $3.10 billion in Q1 2022.Still, Chugai’s bottom line is very intriguing as annual earnings are now projected to soar 226% this year at $2.84 per share Vs. EPS of $0.87 in 2022. Fiscal 2024 earnings are expected to be virtually flat but slightly up at 2.85 per share.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchTakeawayThe annual EPS growth for these companies is hard to overlook going into their Q1 reports. To that point, first quarter results could start to reaffirm this and lead to more upside in their stocks. Given their anticipated bottom-line expansion, Coca-Cola, Cadence Design Systems, and Chugai Pharmaceuticals are starting to look like sound investments for 2023 and beyond.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

You can skip our detailed analysis of value and dividend stocks and their performance in the past, and go directly to read 5 Best Undervalued Dividend Stocks to Buy Now. Undervalued stocks trade at a price lower than their intrinsic or true value. These stocks can potentially be a good investment option for investors who are looking to purchase stocks at a discount and hold them for the long term. If an investor can identify a stock that is undervalued due to temporary factors, such as a downturn in the industry or a negative news event, they may be able to purchase the stock at a lower price and benefit from the potential upside when the temporary factors subside.Growth stocks have outperformed value equities in the past as they offer the potential for higher returns and capital appreciation. However, the consistent changes in monetary policies and growing inflation have turned investors’ attention toward value stocks. According to a report by UBS, value stocks surpassed growth equities by 18 percentage points in the first 10 months of 2022. The report mentioned that inflation above 3% has generally fared well for value stocks historically. In addition to this, tight monetary policies also favor value stocks relative to their growth counterparts. The UBS report revealed that value has historically outperformed growth by an average of 4 percentage points, in the 12 months following the bank’s last rate hike in a cycle.Readers can also have a look at 11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy to know more about value investing.Investors consider value stocks because of their solid long-term returns. This has been proven over the years as value has delivered strong returns to shareholders when compared with growth stocks. Since 1926, value investing returned 1,344,600%, compared with a 626,000% return for growth stocks, as reported by Bank of America.

Shares are down about 6% since I first wrote about it. However, we have received $8.93 per share in dividends, which is about 34% of the 2018 share price. So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years. Still not good, but not an impairment of capital either.Since 2018, EPD’s dividend yield has gone from 6.5% to 8% with the annual per share payout growing from $1.72 to $1.96, +14%. The pace of dividend growth has recently increased from about 2% to 5%+. Additionally, Distributable Cash Flow per share (what could be paid to us if management wanted to) has increased 22%, from $2.73 to $3.33, while leverage has come down a little over ½ a turn. So, the balance sheet and cash flow metrics are in better shape than they were 5-years ago, and they were pretty good 5-years ago.The competitive dominance of the asset base, industry leading low leverage, and a founding family with multiple billions of dollars invested alongside us keep it a core holding in the portfolio. We’ll continue to own this company unless the shares become meaningfully overvalued, and if it gets cheaper, we would be very comfortable owning more.”8. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.

(NYSE:MHK) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. One way to achieve this is by employing the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. There's really not all that much to it, even though it might appear quite complex.Companies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model. View our latest analysis for Mohawk Industries The CalculationWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To start off with, we need to estimate the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.Generally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:10-year free cash flow (FCF) estimate2023202420252026202720282029203020312032 Levered FCF ($, Millions) US$922.2mUS$666.4mUS$646.6mUS$730.4mUS$774.8mUS$809.0mUS$839.1mUS$866.1mUS$891.1mUS$914.5mGrowth Rate Estimate SourceAnalyst x7Analyst x8Analyst x3Analyst x2Analyst x1Est @ 4.42%Est @ 3.72%Est @ 3.22%Est @ 2.88%Est @ 2.63% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 10% US$835US$547US$480US$491US$472US$446US$419US$392US$365US$339(""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$4.8bStory continuesThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.1%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 10%.Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2032 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$915m× (1 + 2.1%) ÷ (10%– 2.1%) = US$11bPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$11b÷ ( 1 + 10%)10= US$4.1bThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$8.9b. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$97.1, the company appears quite good value at a 31% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind.dcfImportant AssumptionsThe calculation above is very dependent on two assumptions. The first is the discount rate and the other is the cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Mohawk Industries as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 10%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.406. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.SWOT Analysis for Mohawk IndustriesStrengthDebt is not viewed as a risk.WeaknessEarnings declined over the past year.OpportunityAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.Good value based on P/S ratio and estimated fair value.ThreatAnnual revenue is expected to decline over the next 3 years.Looking Ahead:Valuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For example, changes in the company's cost of equity or the risk free rate can significantly impact the valuation. What is the reason for the share price sitting below the intrinsic value?

Results from the TRuE-V program showed that treatment with Opzelura led to significant improvements in facial and total body repigmentation versus vehicle.EC’s approval was on the cards, as the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use had earlier given a positive opinion on the same.Opzelura is already approved in the United States for the topical treatment of non-segmental vitiligo in patients 12 years of age and older, and for the topical short-term and non-continuous chronic treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis (AD) in non-immunocompromised patients 12 years of age and older whose disease is not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapies or when those therapies are not advisable.It has been a roller coaster ride for Incyte so far this year. Shares of the company are down 9.6% in the year so far compared with the industry’s decline of 6.4%. Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment Research The initial uptake of Opzelura has been strong and approval in additional geographies will propel sales.Ruxolitinib is approved under the brand name Jakafi for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera (PV) who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to hydroxyurea. It is also approved for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis (MF), including primary MF, post-PV MF and post-essential thrombocythemia MF. The drug is also approved in the United States for the treatment of steroid-refractory acute GVHD in adult and pediatric patients aged 12 years or older.Story continuesLast month, Incyte announced new data from a phase IIb clinical study evaluating the safety and efficacy of povorcitinib (INCB54707), an investigational oral JAK1 inhibitor, in adult patients with extensive nonsegmental vitiligo. Data showed that patients treated with povorcitinib experienced improvements in total body and facial repigmentation.Incyte suffered a setback last month after the company announced that the FDA issued a complete response letter (CRL) for ruxolitinib extended-release (XR) tablets for once-daily (QD) use in the treatment of certain types of myelofibrosis (MF), polycythemia vera (PV) and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).Incyte also decided to discontinue the phase III LIMBER-304 trial following the results of a pre-planned interim analysis conducted by an independent data monitoring committee (IDMC). This indicated that the study is unlikely to meet the primary endpoint in the intent-to-treat patient population. The recommendation to stop the study was not due to safety.The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of parsaclisib plus Jakafi versus placebo plus Jakafi in adult (age ≥18 years) patients living with myelofibrosis (MF) who have an inadequate response to Jakafi monotherapy.On a positive note, the FDA approved Zynyz (retifanlimab-dlwr), a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1), for the treatment of adults with metastatic or recurrent locally advanced Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC).Approval of additional drugs will add an incremental stream of revenues to the top line and reduce the company’s dependence on Jakafi. Incyte has a collaboration agreement with Swiss pharma giant Novartis NVS for Jakafi.Jakafi is marketed by Incyte in the United States and by Novartis as Jakavi outside the country.Zacks Rank and Stocks to ConsiderIncyte currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).Some better-ranked stocks in the overall healthcare sector are Novo Nordisk NVO and Ligand Therapeutics LGND.In the past 30 days, estimates for Novo Nordisk’s 2023 earnings per share have risen from $4.43 to $4.52.

328,1209449c-8041-310f-b1b2-7c45865da42b,WM,2023-04-22,"Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) is largely controlled by institutional shareholders who own 82% of the company",Simply Wall St.,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/waste-management-inc-nyse-wm-110021037.html,1682161221,STORY,['WM'],"[Key InsightsGiven the large stake in the stock by institutions, Waste Management's stock price might be vulnerable to their trading decisionsA total of 24 investors have a majority stake in the company with 50% ownership Insiders have sold recently Every investor in Waste Management, Inc. (NYSE:WM) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. And the group that holds the biggest piece of the pie are institutions with 82% ownership. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.Because institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Hence, having a considerable amount of institutional money invested in a company is often regarded as a desirable trait.Let's delve deeper into each type of owner of Waste Management, beginning with the chart below. See our latest analysis for Waste Management ownership-breakdownWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Waste Management?Institutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.We can see that Waste Management does have institutional investors; and they hold a good portion of the company's stock. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. If multiple institutions change their view on a stock at the same time, you could see the share price drop fast. It's therefore worth looking at Waste Management's earnings history below. Of course, the future is what really matters.earnings-and-revenue-growthInvestors should note that institutions actually own more than half the company, so they can collectively wield significant power. We note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in Waste Management. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is currently the company's largest shareholder with 9.2% of shares outstanding. With 8.7% and 7.5% of the shares outstanding respectively, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation Asset Trust and BlackRock, Inc. are the second and third largest shareholders.Story continuesAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 24 have the combined ownership of 50% in the company, suggesting that no single shareholder has significant control over the company.Researching institutional ownership is a good way to gauge and filter a stock's expected performance. The same can be achieved by studying analyst sentiments. There are a reasonable number of analysts covering the stock, so it might be useful to find out their aggregate view on the future.Insider Ownership Of Waste ManagementThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. Company management run the business, but the CEO will answer to the board, even if he or she is a member of it.I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Waste Management, Inc. in their own names. As it is a large company, we'd only expect insiders to own a small percentage of it. But it's worth noting that they own US$132m worth of shares. It is always good to see at least some insider ownership, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been selling. General Public OwnershipThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 18% stake in Waste Management. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.Next Steps:It's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Waste Management better, we need to consider many other factors. Take risks for example - Waste Management has   2 warning signs   we think you should be aware of.If you would prefer discover what analysts are predicting in terms of future growth, do not miss this free report on analyst forecasts.NB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

The technology-laden Nasdaq index has gained 17% year to date. With a recovery underway, now looks like an opportune time for investors to wade back into high-growth stocks, while also looking for companies with attractive valuations.There happen to be many high-growth stocks that can be purchased right now at attractive prices and valuations. Indeed, I think the majority of gains for many of these high-growth stocks could be in the coming years.That’s partially due to investor positioning favoring defensive stocks right now. Should investors rotate back into a more balanced investment mix, these high-growth stocks could really take off in the next bull market.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsSo, without further ado, here are seven high-growth stocks that could make you a fortune, if you get in now.CMGChipotle Mexican Grill$1,800AIC3.AI$20.06INTUIntuit$446.40RACEFerrari$278.03CRMSalesforce$199.03METAMeta Platforms$212.89MSFTMicrosoft$285.76Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG)a pedestrian walks past a ChipotleSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.comShares of Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) continue to outperform. In 2023, CMG stock has increased 30%. Since the Covid-19 pandemic struck in 2020, the company’s share price has nearly tripled. Indeed, No matter what headwinds crop up, Chipotle seems ready and able to weather the storm and come out stronger on the other side. The company’s growth has continued unabated, with Chipotle’s management team recently announcing plans to open 285 new locations and hire 15,000 workers this year.While many restaurant chains have struggled to win back customers coming out of the pandemic, Chipotle hasn’t missed a beat. The company’s strong performance has led to a number of analyst upgrades and bullish predictions about CMG stock. U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) recently labeled CMG stock a “strong buy,” saying in a note to clients that “We continue to view Chipotle as one of the most compelling growth stocks.”Story continuesC3.ai (AI)AI stocks an intelligent robot figure representing ai stocks, investing for the next decadeSource: ShutterstockWhen it comes to technology, artificial intelligence is the hot sector this year. And among AI stocks, none is hotter right now than C3.ai (NYSE:AI).So far this year, AI stock is up 105%, driven almost entirely by the hype surrounding generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT. The good news for investors is that despite the big year-to-date run, C3.ai’s stock still trades for less than $25 per share, making it affordable for most investors.To be fair, the short interest in AI stock has grown dramatically in recent months, with a quarter (25%) of the company’s stock now sold short. There are rumblings on message boards such as r/WallStreetBets that a major short squeeze is brewing for the stock.That said, there’s also a fundamental thesis supporting this rise. C3.ai has reported strong quarterly earnings and its stock has continued to rise despite a growing chorus of naysayers predicting it will decline.In my view, long-term buy and hold investors might want to get in on the ground floor with this stock.Intuit (INTU)Person holding cellphone with logo of US financial software company Intuit Inc. (INTU) on screen in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.comIntuit (NASDAQ:INTU), the software company behind TurboTax, QuickBooks, and Credit Karma, has been on a roll this year, with its stock gaining 13% since the first trading day in January. Over the past five years, INTU stock has risen nearly 150%.Businesses and consumers alike are fans of Intuit’s products, which help them with their finances. This has made the company’s stock a winning investment. Helping matters, Intuit has consistently reported better-than-expected earnings.While Intuit isn’t as well-known or widely-covered as other tech companies or software developers, it has provided great returns to investors who have stuck with it over the years. Despite being around since 1983, Intuit continues to boast impressive growth. In its most recent quarter, Intuit reported that its earnings per share grew 42% from a year earlier. Analysts, on average, forecast that Intuit’s earnings per share will increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 15% over the next five years.Ferrari (RACE)A photo of the Ferrari logo on a red bannerSource: ShutterstockShares of Italian luxury racecar manufacturer Ferrari (NYSE:RACE) look ready to shift into overdrive. Since the start of the year, RACE stock has sped ahead by 30%. This at a time when more traditional automakers such as General Motors (NYSE:GM) and Volkswagen (ETR:VOW3) are limping along with their stock up only about 5% on the year. The keys to Ferrari’s success have been robust sales and strong margins.Ferrari reported record earnings in 2022, and a strong backlog of orders indicates that the luxury automaker may do even better this year. Additionally, Ferrari is embracing fully electric and hybrid model sports cars, promising that they will comprise 80% of its annual sales by 2030.Despite the transition to EVs, Ferrari is assuring investors that it will remain in growth mode, forecasting that its earnings will grow by a compound annual growth rate of 9% through decade’s end.Salesforce (CRM)The entrance sign of Salesforce Tower, at the American cloud-based software company Salesforce's (CRM stock) Headquarters campus in San Francisco, California.Source: Tada Images / Shutterstock.comThings are looking up for Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). Among the world’s largest cloud computing companies, Salesforce has seen its stock rise 47% this year, making it a top performer in 2023. The gain is welcome news for shareholders who have had to watch Salesforce, which specializes in customer relationship management software, struggle over the last year with a number of problems that led to a cratering share price.Specifically, Salesforce was targeted by several activist investors and saw the departure of multiple top executives. The turmoil pushed CRM stock down 60% between November 2021 and December 2022.Fortunately, the company is now on the mend, with its stock jumping 16% in one day after it delivered better-than-expected earnings and issued strong forward guidance. Salesforce also announced that it is doubling its stock buyback program to $20 billion from $10 billion previously.

The share price is now back above $200 and a new 52-week high looks close at hand. Sentiment towards the company run by Mark Zuckerberg has improved dramatically since the company scaled back its investments in the metaverse and undertook company-wide cost cutting initiatives.Meta Platforms has managed to win back investors’ trust with aggressive spending cuts that have included laying off more than 20,000 employees. Zuckerberg has labeled 2023 the “year of efficiency.” Meta Platforms has also announced a $40 billion stock buyback program, which has helped to lift its share price. Additionally, META stock is also benefitting from the company’s forays into A.I. and government threats to ban Chinese social media app TikTok.Microsoft (MSFT)Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.Source: NYCStock / Shutterstock.comMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a lot going for it right now. The company is arguably the biggest winner so far in the artificial intelligence race. Executives at the tech giant had the foresight to invest $10 billion into privately held OpenAI,  a move that has enabled Microsoft to integrate the powerful ChatGPT AI system into its Bing search engine. Now, recent headlines have piqued investor interest in the stock once again, as Samsung is reportedly considering making Bing the default web browser on its smartphones, laptops and other electronic devices, replacing Google.If that weren’t enough, Microsoft is nearing the finish line on its $68 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard (NASDAQ:ATVI), which seems increasingly-likely to be approved by regulators in the coming months. The Activision purchase will bolster Microsoft’s already impressive library of exclusive game titles that includes Halo and Forza Motorsport. The company is now talking about the potential of AI to enhance its video game offerings.

This means the annual payment is 5.0% of the current stock price, which is above the average for the industry. See our latest analysis for Whirlpool Whirlpool's Earnings Easily Cover The DistributionsWhile it is great to have a strong dividend yield, we should also consider whether the payment is sustainable. Even though Whirlpool isn't generating a profit, it is generating healthy free cash flows that easily cover the dividend. In general, cash flows are more important than the more traditional measures of profit so we feel pretty comfortable with the dividend at this level.Analysts expect a massive rise in earnings per share in the next year. Assuming the dividend continues along recent trends, we think the payout ratio will be 16%, which makes us pretty comfortable with the sustainability of the dividend.historic-dividendWhirlpool Has A Solid Track RecordThe company has an extended history of paying stable dividends. Since 2013, the annual payment back then was $2.00, compared to the most recent full-year payment of $7.00. This implies that the company grew its distributions at a yearly rate of about 13% over that duration. It is good to see that there has been strong dividend growth, and that there haven't been any cuts for a long time.The Company Could Face Some Challenges Growing The DividendInvestors could be attracted to the stock based on the quality of its payment history. Whirlpool has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 18% per annum. It's not great that the company is not turning a profit, but the decent growth in recent years is certainly a positive sign. If the company can become profitable soon, continuing on this trajectory would bode well for the future of the dividend.In SummaryOverall, it's nice to see a consistent dividend payment, but we think that longer term, the current level of payment might be unsustainable. The company is generating plenty of cash, but we still think the dividend is a bit high for comfort. Overall, we don't think this company has the makings of a good income stock.Story continuesInvestors generally tend to favour companies with a consistent, stable dividend policy as opposed to those operating an irregular one. At the same time, there are other factors our readers should be conscious of before pouring capital into a stock. For example, we've identified 3 warning signs for Whirlpool (1 is a bit unpleasant!) that you should be aware of before investing. Looking for more high-yielding dividend ideas?

Notably, Morgan Stanley analysts warned about U.S. recession risks prior to 2023. Naturally, these fears only accelerated due to the recent bank failures.If that wasn’t enough, the Federal Reserve has a bear of a time containing historically high inflation. Unfortunately, the alliance between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-member oil-producing nations — known as OPEC+ — imposed a surprise production cut, leading to higher crude prices. Therefore, it’s only sensible to consider the best defensive stocks.Of course, one could always choose to be out of the market altogether. However, for those that want to stay, these defensive stocks to buy may offer significant protection because of their relevance.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFIVEFive Below$204.02MDLZMondelez$70.50SRESempra Energy$155.87BJBJ’s Wholesale Club$74.50CAGConagra Brands$37.16ELEstee Lauder$257.58BUDAnheuser-Busch Inbev$64.37Five Below (FIVE)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comAn American chain of specialty discount stores Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) ranks among the defensive stocks to buy due to its ability to meet consumers’ needs, particularly at an increasingly desperate time. What makes Five Below distinct from other discount retailers centers on pricing diversity. Here, we’re not talking about junk products for a buck. Rather, customers can find eclectic items up to $25.Financially, Five Below facilitates confidence among investors seeking the best defensive stocks. First, the retailer carries decent stability in the balance sheet. Its Altman Z-Score pings at 5.41, indicating fiscal resilience and low bankruptcy risk.Operationally, Five Below features a three-year revenue growth rate of 18.8%, outpacing 81.47% of companies listed in the cyclical retail industry. On the bottom line, its net margin comes out to 8.5%, above nearly 82% of its peers. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg FIVE as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target lands at $224.67, implying 9% upside potential.Story continuesMondelez (MDLZ)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA relatively easy idea among defensive stocks to buy, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a multinational confectionary, food and beverage, and snack company. Fundamentally, stressed-out consumers may look for cheap pick-me-ups during a recession. For that, Mondelez’s many tempting brands could fit the bill. Since the start of this year, MDLZ gained over 5% of its equity value.Financially, the company presents a mix of differing characteristics. Right off the bat, Mondelez could use some work with its balance sheet. For example, its cash-to-debt ratio ranks much lower than other safe stocks listed in the packaged goods sector. On the other hand, its operational stats impress. Notably, Mondelez’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 8.6%, above 61.69% of its peers. On the bottom line, its net margin touches down at 8.63%, outpacing almost 76% of the competition.Lastly, covering analysts peg MDLZ as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $76.36, implying over 9% upside potential.Sempra Energy (SRE)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA public utility holding company based in San Diego, California, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) arguably represents a go-to among the top defensive stocks to buy. Fundamentally, Sempra – like other public utilities – benefits from a natural monopoly. Basically, with such a steep barrier to entry, would-be competitors don’t even try. As well, Sempra symbolizes the “tax” residents must pay to live in sunny California.Despite what you hear on partisan programming, people love California because frankly, you’re not going to find Golden State weather in other parts of the country. Therefore, I’m not concerned about Sempra’s less-than-robust balance sheet. The net demand for life in California – especially SoCal – more than makes up for any shortfalls. Also, where Sempra’s strengths shine is in profitability. Its net margin pings at 14.81%, outpacing 74.57% of its peers. Thus, it’s one of the resilient stocks despite some not-so-great stats.In closing, analysts peg SRE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $168.11, implying nearly 10% upside potential.BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7With stubbornly high inflation hitting consumers hard, some of the best defensive stocks to buy stem from the big-box retailers. However, I’ve already talked about the usual suspects so it’s time to shine the spotlight on BJ’s Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ). A membership-only warehouse club chain, BJ’s features similar fundamentals to that other membership-only warehouse club. Basically, bulk purchases help mitigate the sting of inflation.Financially, BJ’s presents a solid profile, making it an ideal choice among recession-resistant stocks. On the balance sheet, BJ’s features an Altman Z-Score of 4.52. Again, this stat reflects high stability and low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the retailer posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 14.3%. This stat ranks above 83.39% of companies listed in the defensive retail industry. Also, its net margin comes out to 2.66%, beating out nearly 65% of sector rivals.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg BJ as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $82.36, implying nearly 12% upside potential.Conagra Brands (CAG)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAn American consumer packaged goods holding company, Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) makes and sells products under various brand names that are available in supermarkets, restaurants, and food service establishments. Naturally, Conagra ranks among the top defensive stocks to buy because it feeds a critical human need. We, humans, don’t perform so well without a daily minimum intake of calories.Financially, it must be stated that Conagra doesn’t quite feature the same magnitude of green ink as other recession-resistant stocks. Perhaps most problematic when it comes to the balance sheet, Conagra’s cash-to-debt ratio sits at 0.01. That’s crazy low for the consumer packaged goods industry and frankly other sectors.However, Conagra enjoys a solid net margin of 6.59%. Also, the market prices CAG at a forward multiple of 12.84. As a discount to projected earnings, Conagra ranks better than 70.14% of the competition. Looking to the Street, analysts peg CAG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $41.92, implying over 13% upside potential.Estee Lauder (EL)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAn American multinational cosmetics company, Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) is a manufacturer and marketer of makeup, skincare, fragrance, and hair care products. While it might not be everyone’s first idea for defensive stocks to buy, Estee Lauder could be quite relevant. In particular, with companies recalling their workers back to the office, the incentive to look presentable accelerates. That should be net beneficial for EL.Another reason to consider EL as one of the recession-resistant stocks centers on its financials. While it doesn’t enjoy the strongest balance sheet ever, the cosmetics giant features an Altman Z-Score of 6.19, reflecting robust resilience against potentially incoming headwinds. Operationally, the company features an okay three-year revenue growth rate of 6.6%. However, this stat might rise with the back-to-office movement. Also, its net margin pings at 9.13%, beating out 77.25% of its peers.Finally, analysts peg EL as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $290.50, implying over 14% upside potential.Anheuser-Busch (BUD)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comTheoretically offering consumers some liquid relief, Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) got into some hot water recently because of its partnership with a social media star. Long story short, conservative commentators objected to Anheuser’s Bud Light brand working with Dylan Mulvaney, a TikTok star who documented her gender transition journey. To be fair, the move seems risky because consumer demographics data reveals that Republicans more so than Democrats prefer light beer brands, including Bud Light.However, as I wrote for Fintel, other companies generated far worse controversies, scandals that actually hurt millions of households. Yet, those enterprises did just fine in the end and that might be the case for Anheuser. Financially, the metrics undergirding BUD stock could use some work. However, Anheuser is profitable, featuring a net margin of 10.33%. This stat ranks better than 66.18% of its peers, making BUD one of the top defensive stocks to buy.Lastly, analysts peg BUD as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $74.67, implying almost 16% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

332,7ac07752-c077-3200-8d70-2ec14c5e135b,LYB,2023-04-22,20 Biggest Chemical Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/20-biggest-chemical-companies-world-153956656.html,1682091596,STORY,"['BAK', 'XOM', 'LYB']","[In this article, we will be taking a look at the 20 biggest chemical companies in the world. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 biggest chemical companies in the world.One of the most important industries in the world, the chemical industry is also directly integral to many other major sectors, which is why its incredible recovery after the Covid-19 pandemic seemingly subsided was great news for everyone, and especially manufacturing concerns. In fact, according to a report by BASF, one of the biggest chemical companies in the world, real change in 2021 vs the prior year was 6.1%, after a decline of 0.1% in 2020, mainly led by the European Union, where chemical production grew by 6%, and Asia, where production grew by a very healthy 7.6%. Of course, part of the contribution towards higher growth in 2021 is that the base year of 2020 was mostly stagnant while declining in some regions, especially in Japan, where the decline was 12.7% versus the prior year. Overall, the decline in 2020 was just 0.1% which makes the substantial growth rate of 2021 an even bigger achievement. While we have covered some of this information in our previous take on the top 10 chemical companies in the world in 2022, what wasn't available at the time was BASF's 2023 outlook, which shows that Europe will not be able to sustain its growth, which will fall by 5.2% in 2023, following a 5.8% decline in 2022, as the Russia-Ukraine war has had a disproportionate impact as rising energy costs have led to energy-intensive chemical production plummeting in the continent, and demand will continue to be driven by the automotive industry. The biggest decline in Europe is led by the United Kingdom, a country which has struggled massively and is not expected to recover in the near-term.20 biggest chemical companies in the worldNEstudio/Shutterstock.comIn fact, in a response to a question about the European chemical industry, the CEO of BASF mentioned in the company's Q4 2022 earnings call  ""Well, I mean, as I said earlier, I mean this understanding that the U.S. is going on OpEx and the U.S. going on OpEx and the Europe is more on CapEx. I think this is just making its way now into the minds of people who are now working on the answers. My concern is currently that we want to answer the IRA with the next regulatory packages. And I think this is not doing the job. So we have to also impact there and make people understand. I see that there is a certain nervousness in prices about what the right answer is because I think there's also fundamental data about the growth and how much we lost now in this situation in terms of competitiveness.""Story continuesThe biggest chemical market in the world right now is China, which will continue to see growth of 4% even though demand from consumer goods and electronics industries has weakened. However, this has been somewhat offset by higher demand from the automotive industry. While growth in the United States was mostly stable, coming in at 1.8% in 2021 despite a decline of 3.5% in 2020, with growth being defined by higher demand in both specialty and commodity chemicals which has allowed chemical companies to increase their prices through the year. Because of higher demand, many of the biggest chemical companies in the world have stocked up in order to build capacity, while also investing significantly to improve their capital infrastructure in a bid to enter more markets and carry out mergers and acquisitions to deliver further growth as needed.Despite some positive key performance indicators, it is true that the chemical industry, like almost every other industry in the world, has been impacted by inflation which reached record levels in most countries. Inflation has resulted in an increase in the costs of goods sold, which in turn has deteriorated margins because of which companies have had to work hard to either reduce costs in other areas or by increasing prices, which in turn hurts demand.Also like most industries, chemical industries are heavily focused on sustainability as ESG is now a dominant factor in concerning investment potential as evidenced by the biggest ESG companies in the world. Decarbonization is one of the most pressing requirements that will define the future of the chemical industry, because of which companies have already started to undertake research and increase their R&amp;D costs, in a bid to lower their carbon footprint with the fight against climate change, one of the biggest global risks for 2023. The higher the level of sustainability and a company's ESG activities, the more favorably it will be received both by customers and investors. After all, chemical companies are responsible for some of the highest levels of toxic waste in the world, and companies efforts to reduce this will have a significant impact on their perception.As we mentioned earlier, the demand for specialty and commodity chemicals has resulted in many of the biggest chemical companies transforming their portfolios mainly due to petrochemical expansion in the U.S. Gulf Coast, while digitization is also required for these companies to remain future-proof. According to Deloitte, digital transformation is extremely necessary for to shift the landscape of the chemical industry, even though the immediate focus will be to stabilize platforms that already exist in a bid to maximize monetary benefits before expanding further to other areas.  Another area of change for the chemical industry is to become more customer centric in order to retain customer loyalty and customer retention. While the Covid-19 pandemic may have accelerated this trend, the industry has already been shifting towards being more customer driven now.To determine the biggest chemical companies in the world, we have considered both market cap and trailing twelve month revenue to rank each company with data taken from Yahoo Finance, using that to calculate the company's average ranking. For companies which are not listed, their ranking is based on revenue alone. There are also several major companies which count among the biggest chemical companies in the world, but chemicals only make up a percentage of their total sales. For these companies, we have used either their annual reports and C&amp;EN's data about their chemical revenue only. We have also then used the proportion of their chemical sales to total sales to calculate their applicable market cap. So, let's now take a look at the chemical giants of the world, starting with:20.

333,b4eb786a-7c53-3b87-86ce-b31f7aa91e75,LYB,2023-04-22,LyondellBasell (LYB) Expected to Beat Earnings Estimates: Should You Buy?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/lyondellbasell-lyb-expected-beat-earnings-140002928.html,1682085602,STORY,"['LYB', 'EMN']","[Wall Street expects a year-over-year decline in earnings on lower revenues when LyondellBasell (LYB) reports results for the quarter ended March 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates.The stock might move higher if these key numbers top expectations in the upcoming earnings report, which is expected to be released on April 28. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower.While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise.Zacks Consensus EstimateThis oil refiner and chemical company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $1.80 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of -55%.Revenues are expected to be $10.35 billion, down 21.3% from the year-ago quarter.Estimate Revisions TrendThe consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 6.58% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period.Investors should keep in mind that the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts may not always get reflected in the aggregate change.Earnings WhisperEstimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. This insight is at the core of our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction).The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier.Story continuesThus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only.A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP.Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell).How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for LyondellBasell?For LyondellBasell, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.99%.On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3.So, this combination indicates that LyondellBasell will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate.Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue?Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number.For the last reported quarter, it was expected that LyondellBasell would post earnings of $1.09 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.29, delivering a surprise of +18.35%.Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times.Bottom LineAn earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss.That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported.LyondellBasell appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release.An Industry Player's Expected ResultsAnother stock from the Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, Eastman Chemical (EMN), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.22 per share for the quarter ended March 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of -40.8%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $2.37 billion, down 12.7% from the year-ago quarter.Over the last 30 days, the consensus EPS estimate for Eastman Chemical has been revised 1.6% down to the current level. Nevertheless, the company now has an Earnings ESP of 1.68%, reflecting a higher Most Accurate Estimate.When combined with a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold), this Earnings ESP indicates that Eastman Chemical will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Over the last four quarters, the company surpassed consensus EPS estimates two times.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

If you want to skip a detailed analysis including the pros and cons of diversified companies, go directly to the 5 Best Diversified Stocks to Buy Now.During the current economic turmoil and volatility, investing in companies with diversified products and service portfolios can be beneficial. In 2022, many indexes in the financial markets suffered a steep decline due to several industries falling prey to rising interest rates and inflation. At the end of the year, NASDAQ was down by 34%, the S&amp;P 500 index was down by almost 20%, and Dow Jones recorded a decline of 8.8%. In such economic downturns, companies with diverse product portfolios can shield themselves better as one segment's gains can offset the losses of another within the firm.One case that can be made for conglomerates or diversified companies is that renowned American investors like Warren Buffett, David Tepper, Michael Larson, and Richard S. Pzena have significant investments in diversified companies such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B), and General Electric Company (NYSE:GE). Some advantages of many diversified companies are that most of them are cash-rich well-established blue-chip stocks that can remain stable during market downturns. This trend can be seen in the Dow Jones index, a collection of 30 of the finest blue-chip stocks that suffered the least during the tough macroeconomic conditions of 2022. A healthy cash position also means that these companies will not shy away from shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share repurchases. Diversification also helps a company expand its customer base and face fewer threats from the competition.11 Best Diversified Stocks to Buy NowOur MethodologyAfter careful market analysis, we found and listed down the best companies that have diversified product portfolios. We listed the companies according to their hedge fund sentiment which was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 943 elite hedge funds. Moreover, we skipped some companies that have diverse portfolios of products and services because they generate most of their revenue from a single source.Story continuesBest Diversified Stocks to Buy Now11. Sea Limited (NYSE:SE)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 48Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) is a tech conglomerate based in Singapore. It initially started as a game developer in 2009. However, in addition to its game development platform, the company now owns two banks, a Singaporean soccer team, a digital payment platform, and an e-commerce company.A total of 48 hedge funds had stakes in the company as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. Kora Management owned over 3.97 million shares of the company in the fourth quarter, making it the hedge fund with the largest stake in Sea Limited (NYSE:SE).Here is what Hayden Capital had to say about Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:“Sea Limited (NYSE:SE) reported earnings last week, after which the share price rebounded +36% in a single day. The most obvious question that comes to mind, is why didn’t we sell more last year, when prices were still high? The truth is that we did sell a significant amount, but in hindsight obviously wish we were more aggressive with the sales.For example, we owned the peak number of shares of Sea Ltd in Q1 2020, and steadily trimmed over the next two years. From Q1 2020 to Q1 2022, we trimmed ~39% of our shares over that period. However, the issue was that the investment continued to grow as a percentage of the overall portfolio, since the share price appreciated much faster than our sales (+620% from 1Q20 to 3Q21). This was a similar case for our other long-tenured positions as well.So why didn’t we trim more aggressively and just hold cash? The answer is that at its core, I believe that holding cash is implicitly a market timing call. I certainly didn’t foresee a likely recession on the horizon so quickly after the turbulence of Covid already had on the economy. Even in late 2021, after it was clear interest rates would start rising, we were still operating under the assumption that rates would cause valuations to compress, but likely wouldn’t have an impact on the overall earnings trajectory. Given our expectations for strong earnings growth, we thought this could more than offset the valuation compression over time, and would still generate strong IRRs over a 3 – 5 year timeframe…” (Click here to see the full text)10. 3M Company (NYSE:MMM)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 523M Company (NYSE:MMM) is one of the biggest diversified companies, offering thousands of products for different industries.

Nonetheless, we’ve always liked this business with its diversified revenues, its R&amp;D leadership and its stable margins.”9.

General Electric’s remaining businesses include Aerospace and its Power and Renewables business. Aerospace is performing well and comprises the bulk of General Electric’s value in our opinion. We believe that the spin-off of General Electric HealthCare Technologies has highlighted the value of General Electric’s remaining business units. General Electric intends to spin out its Power and Renewables business unit early in 2024.”8. Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 60Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) is an American mass media and entertainment giant headquartered in New York. The company’s products and services include theme parks, comics, films, video games, sports broadcasting, and streaming services, along with many others.

(NASDAQ:WBD) in Q4 2022, compared to 61 in Q3 2022.Artisan Partners made the following comment about Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD) is a global media and entertainment company that is the result of the 2022 merger of Discovery and WarnerMedia. Warner is known for its theatrical releases, networks (CNN, TNT, TBS) and pay television network HBO and related over-the-top streaming service HBO Max. The legacy Discovery business distributes content across US and international networks—such as HGTV, Discovery, TLC, Food Network and Animal Planet—as well as its own streaming service Discovery+. We believe the total portfolio of content and entertainment assets should provide a compelling direct-to-consumer offering to attract viewers and the scale to invest in original content. There is a lot of opportunity, but there’s also uncertainty related to the merger’s integration and realized cost synergies. These questions, in addition to a challenging macro environment for advertising and foreign exchange headwinds, have been overhangs on the stock price.Further, media and entertainment stocks have come under pressure due to skepticism about the industry’s long-term economics. Our view is streaming is a scale and intellectual property business that will result in a few large winners, and we believe HBO Max will be among this group. WBD looks like a bargain, selling at a double-digit FCF yield.”7. Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 84Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is an American multinational company with a diverse product line including pharmaceuticals, consumer health, medical devices, vision care, and nutrition.

Each stock was up 1% in the quarter compared to the 16% price decline for the S&amp;P 500 and the positions were reduced as the valuations became somewhat less appealing, though still attractive enough to warrant inclusion.”6. Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 88Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) is an American multi-industry company with various business segments including life sciences, diagnostics, environmental and applied solutions, and dental products. On February 22, with the announcement of an 8% increase to its quarterly dividend, Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) recorded its ninth consecutive year of dividend growth.

The next quarterly dividend will be payable by Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) on April 29, to the shareholders of record on March 31.Stewart Asset Management mentioned Danaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) in its Q3 2022 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:“We also need to point out one global consequence of the rapid rise in interest rates: an irrepressibly strong dollar. This hurts the reported earnings of U.S. companies who sell their goods and services overseas. Foreign currency earnings translate into fewer dollars and thus lower earnings. Most of the companies in your portfolios gain a notable amount of earnings from their international operations. While the strength or weakness of a currency doesn’t change the quality of a business or its longer-term earnings power, it can change the reported earnings of a company over short periods of time. It is difficult to forecast this effect accurately because many of our companies manufacture where they sell, which to some extent dulls the sharp negative effect of a surging dollar. Danaher (NYSE:DHR), among others, is a good example.” Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Diversified Stocks to Buy Now. Suggested Articles:12 Best Biotech Stocks To Buy Under $2010 Best ASX Stocks to Buy Now14 Best Dividend Aristocrat Stocks To Buy NowDisclosure: None. 11 Best Diversified Stocks to Buy Now is originally published on Insider Monkey.]"

Next week will be the first big week of this reporting cycle as more than 1,000 companies are slated to announce their financial numbers. Five U.S. corporate giants with a favorable Zacks Rank are poised to beat on earnings next week.Early-Stage Q1 ResultsMarket participants will try to analyze this reporting cycle against the backdrop of a possible recession later this year.

With this in mind, we are always looking at value, growth, and momentum trends to discover great companies.Considering these trends, value investing is clearly one of the most preferred ways to find strong stocks in any type of market. Value investors use a variety of methods, including tried-and-true valuation metrics, to find these stocks.Luckily, Zacks has developed its own Style Scores system in an effort to find stocks with specific traits. Value investors will be interested in the system's ""Value"" category. Stocks with both ""A"" grades in the Value category and high Zacks Ranks are among the strongest value stocks on the market right now.Valero Energy (VLO) is a stock many investors are watching right now. VLO is currently sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), as well as a Value grade of A. The stock holds a P/E ratio of 5.55, while its industry has an average P/E of 6.01. Over the last 12 months, VLO's Forward P/E has been as high as 12.62 and as low as 4.41, with a median of 6.24.Finally, investors should note that VLO has a P/CF ratio of 3.39.

Over the past year, VLO's P/CF has been as high as 11.91 and as low as 3.26, with a median of 4.33.These are only a few of the key metrics included in Valero Energy's strong Value grade, but they help show that the stock is likely undervalued right now.

339,75284825-fe74-30c8-8bc7-137d3e9273cd,VLO,2023-04-22,Buy 5 High ROE Stocks as Earnings Season Kicks Off,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/buy-5-high-roe-stocks-122912782.html,1682080152,STORY,"['DAL', 'VLO', 'SUZ', 'R', 'AN']","[The U.S. equity markets witnessed intense volatility over the past couple of days as corporate earnings season kicked off. With a relatively modest earnings performance from hitherto reported companies, investors are searching for definite cues to the economic growth trajectory as market signals remain mixed. On the one hand, recession fears are spooking the market, while on the other, the easing inflation trend is buoying it. To elucidate, the markets remained on tenterhooks as Fed officials observed in its March policy meeting that the banking crisis could drag the economy into a mild recession later this year.However, data from the March producer price index, a leading indicator of consumer inflation, revealed a 0.5% decline month over month compared with broad-based expectations of a relatively flat curve. The core wholesale prices reading (which excludes food and energy) fell 0.1% sequentially against wide expectations of a 0.2% increase. With softening inflationary pressures, investors largely expect the Fed to hold the interest rates in the near term. Moreover, the Fed indicated earlier that there might be just another hike in the current year depending on the macroeconomic factors, as tightening credit conditions could put pressure on the economy.As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. AutoNation, Inc. AN, Suzano S.A. SUZ, Valero Energy Corporation VLO, Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL and Ryder System, Inc. R are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.ROE: A Key MetricROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.Story continuesParameters Used for ScreeningIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.   Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 24 stocks that qualified the screen:AutoNation: Incorporated in Delaware in 1991, AutoNation is the largest automotive retailer in the United States. Apart from retailing new and used vehicles, the company offers vehicle maintenance and repair services, vehicle parts, extended service contracts, vehicle protection products and other aftermarket products. In addition, it arranges financing for vehicle purchases through third-party sources.It has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 3.5% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5%, on average.

According to Craig Johnson, we have had ""a series of higher highs and higher lows"" and when we look at the lows that were made in September and October 2022, we observe that at that point in time the market was extremely oversold. Here are some comments from Craig Johnson:""If you come back and you look at history, all the way back to 1929, when you look at the fact that we haven't seen in the first quarter (of 2023) a break back below the December lows of last year (2022). That has historically been a pretty bullish sign for the market. In fact, when you look back in time, the market is typically 83% of the time higher, with about 13.7% annual return, when you don't break back below those December lows in the first quarter of the new year. And that's exactly what we are seeing happen this year.""Story continuesWhile the markets may undergo a correction, according to Craig Johnson, investors should focus on the long term for 2023. Craig Johnson expects the S&amp;P 500 to move up to 4,625 by the end of the year. Here is what Craig Johnson of Piper Sandler said:""If you look at some of the underlying indices, clearly, it is trendlines over headlines at this point in time... All the negativity out there at this point in time, stocks aren't going down. They're starting to trend higher and we really need to pay attention to that fact.""Craig Johnson thinks that the National Bureau of Economic Research will officially declare a recession in the back half of 2023. He noted that once a recession is official, ""history shows that you typically backdate that recession's start date by about 7.6 months"". Out of all the recessions since 1929, it was only in 2002 that the market did not bottom, said Johnson, and he thinks that after the market bottoms the S&amp;P 500 will ""pop"" back to 4,625.Craig Johnson further noted that he sees the Fed starting to cut interest rates in July 2023, or possibly after that, and this will lead to a ""quick drop"" in the markets. Craig Johnson talked about investor positioning right now and said:""We're at levels right now that we have seen only at the lows of the market in 2020, 2011, and 2007. The world is already very negatively positioned, and any drop will get bought from our perspective.""While Craig Johnson's market outlook offers valuable insights into the broader market, investors can also consider the individual stocks recommended by Fast Money traders to identify potential near-term opportunities. Fast Money is a popular TV show on CNBC that offers daily stock picks and market insights from a group of experienced traders.

While we expect China to return to more “normal” operation at some point, any COVID flare-ups, in China or other markets, present a very real headwind to Starbucks’ profitability. L’Oreal, Estée Lauder, and other holdings continue to have meaningful exposure to China, but in each of these cases, our research indicates they’re able to better adapt to these operating challenges and realize the growth opportunity in China through their online businesses.

If you want to explore similar stocks, you can also take a look at 5 Stocks Jim Cramer and Hedge Funds Have in Common.""These Uninformed Sellers, They Make Way For The Well Informed Buyers""On April 20, Jim Cramer weighed in on the recent market volatility we have been experiencing. Cramer has spotted a pattern that the market has been exhibiting recently and noted that while the market opens low, it recovers throughout the day as ""buyers come in and scoop up stocks"". According to Cramer, ""uninformed sellers make way for the well informed buyers"".Cramer attributes the morning weakness of the market to a variety of factors, firstly negative news from Europe. Cramer noted that currently, Europe is not performing well in comparison to the United States since inflation is still running high in the region and that is calling for higher interest rates from the ECB.Another reason that is currently causing market volatility, according to Jim Cramer, is negative macroeconomic speculation. Cramer noted that before the opening bell, economists and strategists speculate negatively about rate hikes from the Fed and this results in the market opening low.Thirdly, Cramer thinks that geopolitical tensions are another major factor contributing to the morning weakness of the markets. Here is what he said:""Hardly a day goes by without a negative story on one of these fronts. Overnight, nothing good is ever gonna happen in China right. Then you gotta pray their government doesn't make any comments about the need to retake Taiwan. You won't hear anything particularly good about Ukraine either, and you certainly can't expect anything good to come out of Washington, especially when it comes to debt ceiling negotiations.""Finally, the Mad Money host talked about ""a negative bias"" that results from analyst downgrades, and results in short sellers making ""stocks look real ugly"". Cramer noted that short sellers engage in aggressive short selling and this causes investors to panic and exit their positions as well. However, short sellers create opportunities for ""people who do their homework"". Cramer noted that intelligent investors allow for ""this big batch of sellers to give them better prices"" and then they buy and take stocks higher.Story continuesTo conclude, Cramer thinks that ""well informed buyers"" can profit in the current market. He simplified the behavior of the market by explaining how we have ""a negative bias every morning emanating from Europe, coupled with a gloomy group of money managers who simply don't believe that bear market has ended"". In such an environment, Cramer has become increasingly selective about stocks. We have compiled a list of 10 stocks that Jim Cramer and hedge funds have in common, so our readers can gain further insights into what kind of companies they should consider positioning in given the turbulent market situation.

Despite volatility and a mid-December decline, most equity markets finished higher in the quarter, and BlackRock, which is heavily tied to these markets, benefited. Additionally, investors are anticipating that the company’s fixed income products will experience growth in 2023. Alternative strategies are expanding as well and should continue to provide a profitable revenue stream.”9. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 55Cramer's charitable trust owns Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). The Mad Money journalist recently broke down the company's earnings and said that though the company reported higher than expected loan losses and ""disappointing"" investment banking line items, an important metric to consider for Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) is ""net new assets because these guys are increasingly in the asset management business"".

The slower November sales were followed by a slight first quarter miss with lower-than-expected margins. Costco commented that they are not seeing trade-down but private label penetration has increased modestly. Traffic continues to be positive, and Costco remains well-positioned in a more challenging macro environment due to its strong value proposition.”Some of Jim Cramer's top stock picks right now include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).7. The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is one of Cramer's ""favorites for all of 2023"". He mentioned the stock among ""great American companies with beaten down stocks"". Though costs for The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) have been coming down, the stock has been beaten down to a point where it may be ""too cheap"". Cramer thinks The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is ""the king of consumer products goods"" and he sees material upside to the stock. As of April 20, The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) has gained 17.32% over the past 6 months.The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) was held by 74 hedge funds at the close of Q4 2022.

The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is placed ninth on our list of stocks that Jim Cramer and hedge funds have in common.Rowan Street Capital made the following comment about The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:“Let’s look at The Procter &amp; Gamble Company (NYSE:PG). Dividend yield is 2.4%. Earnings are forecasted to grow at 5.9%, and its current earnings multiple is at 25x. Now, lets say over the next 3-5 years the market loses interest in the “safe”, mature companies that grow at anemic rates and gets an appetite for growth again. It’s very unlikely that Mr. Market will be paying 25x for 5.9% earnings growth. Lets assume that multiple declines to the market average of 18x — that would be ~6.9% drag per year on the total expected return over next 3-5 years. If we get 2.4% (dividend) + 5.9% (earnings growth) – 6.9% (decrease in earnings multiple) = 1.4% (annual return we can expect on average from this stock).”6. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW)Number of Hedge Fund Holders: 74Jim Cramer has mentioned The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) multiple times in recent days and has been bullish on the stock. Most recently, Cramer spoke about how sentiment around The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) has been negative, but the company disproved the bears after releasing earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2023. Cramer said ""this may be the worst time to invest. But when a good company can see its stock fall by 30%, when there was nothing really wrong, worst time to invest, but invest"". Shares of The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) have gone down by 34%, as of April 20, and the stock is trading at a PE multiple of 14x.On April 17, The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) announced earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2023. The company generated a revenue of $5.12 billion, up 9.50% year over year, and reported an EPS of $0.93, ahead of EPS estimates by $0.03. The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) is one of Jim Cramer's top stock picks that are popular among elite hedge funds.At the close of the fourth quarter of 2022, 74 hedge funds were eager on The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) and held collective positions worth $8.1 billion in the company. Of those, GQG Partners was the most prominent shareholder and held a stake worth $1.4 billion.Madison Investments made the following comment about The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) in its Q1 2023 investor letter:“We bought shares in The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW) as they declined meaningfully in March. Schwab is the premier asset-gathering franchise in the brokerage industry, with particular strength in the advisory market. As one of the top two players in the retail side of the market, it has the scale economies to be a low-cost provider and compete with newcomers intent on industry disruption. In the advisory segment, where it serves independent advisors, it delivers the gold standard in service and product breadth. We believe its moat is wide, and it should grow at a healthy pace for the foreseeable future.As part of its brokerage model, Schwab operates a meaningfully sized bank, where its brokerage clients maintain deposits as part of their cash management. With over $300 billion in deposits and $500 billion in assets, if it were an independent bank, it would be one of the largest in the country. As interest rates have risen, many clients have been moving cash from low-yield bank accounts to higher-yielding alternatives, such as money-market funds. The industry calls this process cash “sorting.” For Schwab, cash sorting began about 18 months ago, and a large part of its recent stock price drop can be attributed to investor concerns that this process may accelerate. The difference for Schwab, compared to all other banks, is that when depositors pull money out, they are mostly just moving it over to other parts of Schwab! Thus, unlike traditional banks, Schwab doesn’t lose assets in the sorting dynamic. In fact, like U.S. Bancorp, Schwab appears to be a net beneficiary from the recent mini-panic in that new asset inflows have picked up as individuals flee to safety.This dynamic does cause some disruption at the bank entity, though, as client cash remains within Schwab’s total but is no longer available as deposits to fund the bank’s securities portfolio. We think Schwab has more than sufficient liquidity to deal with this. The realistic worst-case outcome is that total earnings are moderately suppressed for a period as funding costs go up, and Schwab earns less profit for every dollar invested in deposit alternatives, as compared to what it earns per dollar deposited in the bank. Despite this headwind, we believe that as long as Schwab can grow total investment assets under its umbrella over time, its earning power should also grow.”In addition to The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), other stocks that both Jim Cramer and hedge funds have in common include NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), UnitedHealth Group Inc. (NYSE:UNH), and Meta Platforms, Inc.

But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. In this article, we decided to focus on UnitedHealth Group's  ROE.Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits. Check out our latest analysis for UnitedHealth Group How Do You Calculate Return On Equity?Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula:Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' EquitySo, based on the above formula, the ROE for UnitedHealth Group is:23% = US$21b ÷ US$91b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2023).The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.23 in profit.What Is The Relationship Between ROE And Earnings Growth?So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Depending on how much of these profits the company reinvests or ""retains"", and how effectively it does so, we are then able to assess a company’s earnings growth potential. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.UnitedHealth Group's Earnings Growth And 23% ROEFirstly, we acknowledge that UnitedHealth Group has a significantly high ROE. Second, a comparison with the average ROE reported by the industry of 11% also doesn't go unnoticed by us. Probably as a result of this, UnitedHealth Group was able to see a decent net income growth of 11% over the last five years.Story continuesNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that UnitedHealth Group's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 15% in the same period, which is not something we like to see.past-earnings-growthEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. What is UNH worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether UNH is currently mispriced by the market.Is UnitedHealth Group Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?UnitedHealth Group has a three-year median payout ratio of 30%, which implies that it retains the remaining 70% of its profits. This suggests that its dividend is well covered, and given the decent growth seen by the company, it looks like management is reinvesting its earnings efficiently.Besides, UnitedHealth Group has been paying dividends for at least ten years or more. This shows that the company is committed to sharing profits with its shareholders. Our latest analyst data shows that the future payout ratio of the company over the next three years is expected to be approximately 27%. Therefore, the company's future ROE is also not expected to change by much with analysts predicting an ROE of 28%.SummaryOn the whole, we feel that UnitedHealth Group's performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a respectable growth in its earnings. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

Its bottom-line estimates imply a decline of 3% from the year-ago reported number. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for LKQ’s quarterly revenues also suggests a 2.52% year-over-year decrease. Over the trailing four quarters, LKQ surpassed earnings estimates on three out of four occasions and missed in one, the average surprise being 2.93%.

In addition, the top line fell 5.8% from the year-ago level.Earnings WhispersOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for the automotive replacement parts supplier for the quarter to be reported, as it does not have the right combination of the two key ingredients.

If you want to see more colognes in this selection, go to the 5 Best Smelling Colognes For Men.According to a report by Grand View Research, the size of the perfume industry stood at $50.85 billion in 2022. The perfume industry is set to expand at an average growth rate of 5.9% during the 2023 to 2030 period and reach a size of $80.16 billion. The growth of the perfume industry can be attributed to numerous factors, such as a growing emphasis on personal grooming and the rising demand for both youthful and exotic scents. Additionally, manufacturers are expanding their product lines to cater to a wider audience, further attracting more consumers. The growth of urban areas, expanding populations, and competitive marketing tactics are propelling the demand for perfumes.To improve consumer experiences, manufacturers are prioritizing the creation of innovative and high-quality fragrance solutions. This involves the incorporation of potent oils and flavours to extend the fragrance's shelf-life and eliminate odours. Companies are making use of artificial intelligence technology to launch new fragrance solutions. For example, Sephora, LVMH introduced ‘MAISON 21G’ in April 2021, an AI-driven solution that allows the personalization of scents. Moreover, the widespread use of online retail platforms is expected to drive global product demand by offering consumers a vast selection of fragrances and greater convenience.Competitive Landscape of the Perfume MarketIn the future, the North American region is expected to hold a significant share of the perfume market due to a growing demand for luxury consumer goods. In 2020, the market size in this region was valued at $10.50 billion. Meanwhile, within the Asia Pacific region, China is expected to hold a significant share of the global perfume market. This is due to the increasing purchasing power among Chinese consumers who prefer premium brand scents. The premium segment of the perfume industry is expected to observe the fastest growth. Leading companies in the industry are placing greater emphasis on providing natural fragrances in their premium product lines, driven by growing concerns among consumers regarding allergies and harmful ingredients present in synthetic fragrances. As the premium segment offers greater flexibility for innovation, it is expected to give a boost to product revenues in the near future.Story continuesThe fragrances and perfumes industry is competitive, with both international and regional competitors vying for market share. Dominating the market are major players such as Chanel SA, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (EPA:MC), Christian Dior SE (EPA:CDI), and Capri Holdings Limited (NYSE:CPRI), who employ various strategies like product diversification, AI-powered solutions, and acquisitions to maintain their dominant position.

EL has a strong presence in emerging markets, which insulates it from the macroeconomic headwinds in the matured markets. The beauty company has a strong online business, which is proving to be a major growth driver.However, The Estee Lauder Companies is not immune to inflationary pressures and supply chain-related issues. Let’s discuss this in detail.Factors Working in The Estee Lauder Companies’ Favor?The Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company has a strong presence in emerging markets. The company derives significant revenues from emerging markets like Thailand, India, Russia and Brazil, encouraging it to make distributional, digital and marketing investments in these countries. The Estee Lauder Companies is investing in catering to consumer demand in China and Asia. To this end, it bought Korea-based skincare brand Dr. Jart in 2019.In its second-quarter fiscal 2023 earnings call, management highlighted that several developed and emerging markets globally outpaced its expectations to counter COVID-related issues across China. The company posted strong double-digit organic sales growth across several emerging markets like India, Brazil, Turkey and Malaysia.The company is expanding its consumer reach in productive distribution across high-growth channels, while strategically expanding brands into new countries. Management strengthened its manufacturing, distribution and innovation capabilities. The company opened the China innovation labs, its first plant in the Asia Pacific and a new DC in China. The company also announced its partnership with brands like Tom Ford and Balmain Beauty.Zacks Investment ResearchImage Source: Zacks Investment ResearchThe Estee Lauder Companies is benefiting from a strong online business. The company has been implementing new technology and digital experiences, including online booking for each store appointment, omnichannel loyalty programs and high-touch mobile services. These initiatives and the company’s digital-first mindset have been boosting online sales. The company is expanding its omnichannel capabilities to aid flexible and convenient shopping options for consumers.Story continuesHigh Costs &amp; Supply Chain IssuesThe Estee Lauder Companies reported second-quarter fiscal 2023 results, with the top and the bottom line declining year over year. COVID-19 continued affecting the company’s operating environment throughout the first half of fiscal 2023, which included curbs in China that put pressure on travel retail in Hainan and retail traffic in mainland China. Results were affected by increased inflation, concerns surrounding the recession and unfavorable currency rates.The Estee Lauder Companies’ fiscal second-quarter gross profit came in at $3,401 million, down 21% year over year. The gross margin contracted to 73.6% from 77.9% reported in the year-ago quarter. The downside can be attributed to inflationary pressures across the supply chain, region and category mix and increased costs associated with promotional items. Also, the adjusted operating income declined 42% at cc, mainly due to reduced net sales.Management anticipates the rest of fiscal 2023 to be dynamic, including uncertain consumer recovery in travel retail, evolving COVID-19 situation, inflation, supply chain-related issues and slowdown risk across some markets worldwide. For fiscal 2023, management projects net sales to decrease in the band of 5-7% year over year. Adjusted earnings per share (EPS) are expected in the band of $4.87-$5.02, suggesting a 31-33% decline from the year-ago period’s levels. The bottom line is expected to decline 27-29% at constant currency.That being said, the upsides mentioned above are likely to keep aiding the company’s growth.EL’s stock has gained 31.3% in the past six months compared with the industry’s 33.3% growth.Solid Staple BetsSome other top-ranked consumer staple stocks are General Mills GIS, Beyond Meat BYND and Kimberly-Clark Corporation KMB.General Mills, a branded consumer foods company, carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). GIS has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.1%, on average. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for General Mills’ current fiscal-year sales and earnings suggests growth of 6.3% and 7.4%, respectively, from the corresponding year-ago reported figures.Beyond Meat, which develops, manufactures, markets and sells plant-based meat products, currently carries a Zacks Rank #2. BYND has a trailing four-quarter negative earnings surprise of 29.3%, on average.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Beyond Meat’s current fiscal year earnings suggests an increase of 39.7% from the year-ago reported number.Kimberly-Clark is engaged in the manufacture and marketing of a wide range of consumer products around the world. It currently has a Zacks Rank of 2.

Wall Street clearly dives into all of the other metrics and management's input, but the EPS figure helps cut through all the noise.We know earnings results are vital, but how a company performs compared to bottom line expectations can be even more important when it comes to stock prices, especially in the near-term. This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report. The idea is relatively intuitive as a newer projection might be based on more complete information. The ESP is calculated by comparing the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate, with the percentage difference between the two giving us the Zacks ESP figure.The final step today is to look at a stock that meets our ESP qualifications. Post Holdings (POST) earns a Zacks Rank #1 13 days from its next quarterly earnings release on May 4, 2023, and its Most Accurate Estimate comes in at $0.70 a share.By taking the percentage difference between the $0.70 Most Accurate Estimate and the $0.68 Zacks Consensus Estimate, Post Holdings has an Earnings ESP of 2.94%.POST is just one of a large group of Consumer Staples stocks with a positive ESP figure. Estee Lauder (EL) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Estee Lauder, which is readying to report earnings on May 3, 2023, sits at a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) right now. It's Most Accurate Estimate is currently $0.53 a share, and EL is 12 days out from its next earnings report.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Estee Lauder is $0.48, and when you take the percentage difference between that number and its Most Accurate Estimate, you get the Earnings ESP figure of 9.54%.Story continuesPOST and EL's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

350,310d77ae-6902-35b6-84d6-6346bf49fc2a,EL,2023-04-22,7 Defensive Stocks to Buy to Batten Down the Hatches,InvestorPlace,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/7-defensive-stocks-buy-batten-191057898.html,1681845057,STORY,"['MS', 'ABI', 'SRE', 'FIVE', 'MDLZ', 'BJ', 'BUD', 'EL', 'CAG']","[Although a much-debated topic, investors should at least consider shifting toward defensive stocks to buy ahead of a potential downcycle. Notably, Morgan Stanley analysts warned about U.S. recession risks prior to 2023. Naturally, these fears only accelerated due to the recent bank failures.If that wasn’t enough, the Federal Reserve has a bear of a time containing historically high inflation. Unfortunately, the alliance between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-member oil-producing nations — known as OPEC+ — imposed a surprise production cut, leading to higher crude prices. Therefore, it’s only sensible to consider the best defensive stocks.Of course, one could always choose to be out of the market altogether. However, for those that want to stay, these defensive stocks to buy may offer significant protection because of their relevance.InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice &amp; Trading TipsFIVEFive Below$204.02MDLZMondelez$70.50SRESempra Energy$155.87BJBJ’s Wholesale Club$74.50CAGConagra Brands$37.16ELEstee Lauder$257.58BUDAnheuser-Busch Inbev$64.37Five Below (FIVE)man's hand holding wads of cashSource: Vova Shevchuk / Shutterstock.comAn American chain of specialty discount stores Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE) ranks among the defensive stocks to buy due to its ability to meet consumers’ needs, particularly at an increasingly desperate time. What makes Five Below distinct from other discount retailers centers on pricing diversity. Here, we’re not talking about junk products for a buck. Rather, customers can find eclectic items up to $25.Financially, Five Below facilitates confidence among investors seeking the best defensive stocks. First, the retailer carries decent stability in the balance sheet. Its Altman Z-Score pings at 5.41, indicating fiscal resilience and low bankruptcy risk.Operationally, Five Below features a three-year revenue growth rate of 18.8%, outpacing 81.47% of companies listed in the cyclical retail industry. On the bottom line, its net margin comes out to 8.5%, above nearly 82% of its peers. Finally, Wall Street analysts peg FIVE as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target lands at $224.67, implying 9% upside potential.Story continuesMondelez (MDLZ)Man holding stacks of money. Millionaire.Source: Epic Cure / ShutterstockA relatively easy idea among defensive stocks to buy, Mondelez (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a multinational confectionary, food and beverage, and snack company. Fundamentally, stressed-out consumers may look for cheap pick-me-ups during a recession. For that, Mondelez’s many tempting brands could fit the bill. Since the start of this year, MDLZ gained over 5% of its equity value.Financially, the company presents a mix of differing characteristics. Right off the bat, Mondelez could use some work with its balance sheet. For example, its cash-to-debt ratio ranks much lower than other safe stocks listed in the packaged goods sector. On the other hand, its operational stats impress. Notably, Mondelez’s three-year revenue growth rate pings at 8.6%, above 61.69% of its peers. On the bottom line, its net margin touches down at 8.63%, outpacing almost 76% of the competition.Lastly, covering analysts peg MDLZ as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target comes out to $76.36, implying over 9% upside potential.Sempra Energy (SRE)A person draws a stock chart on a chalkboard.Source: Zurijeta / Shutterstock.comA public utility holding company based in San Diego, California, Sempra Energy (NYSE:SRE) arguably represents a go-to among the top defensive stocks to buy. Fundamentally, Sempra – like other public utilities – benefits from a natural monopoly. Basically, with such a steep barrier to entry, would-be competitors don’t even try. As well, Sempra symbolizes the “tax” residents must pay to live in sunny California.Despite what you hear on partisan programming, people love California because frankly, you’re not going to find Golden State weather in other parts of the country. Therefore, I’m not concerned about Sempra’s less-than-robust balance sheet. The net demand for life in California – especially SoCal – more than makes up for any shortfalls. Also, where Sempra’s strengths shine is in profitability. Its net margin pings at 14.81%, outpacing 74.57% of its peers. Thus, it’s one of the resilient stocks despite some not-so-great stats.In closing, analysts peg SRE as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target hits $168.11, implying nearly 10% upside potential.BJ’s Wholesale Club (BJ)hands at desk near laptop computer, with one hand holding a pile of hundred dollar bills. Bank stocksSource: shutterstock.com/CC7With stubbornly high inflation hitting consumers hard, some of the best defensive stocks to buy stem from the big-box retailers. However, I’ve already talked about the usual suspects so it’s time to shine the spotlight on BJ’s Wholesale Club (NYSE:BJ). A membership-only warehouse club chain, BJ’s features similar fundamentals to that other membership-only warehouse club. Basically, bulk purchases help mitigate the sting of inflation.Financially, BJ’s presents a solid profile, making it an ideal choice among recession-resistant stocks. On the balance sheet, BJ’s features an Altman Z-Score of 4.52. Again, this stat reflects high stability and low bankruptcy risk. Operationally, the retailer posts a three-year revenue growth rate of 14.3%. This stat ranks above 83.39% of companies listed in the defensive retail industry. Also, its net margin comes out to 2.66%, beating out nearly 65% of sector rivals.Turning to Wall Street, analysts peg BJ as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $82.36, implying nearly 12% upside potential.Conagra Brands (CAG)tree growing on coin of stacking with green bokeh background; growth stocksSource: Freedom365day / Shutterstock.comAn American consumer packaged goods holding company, Conagra Brands (NYSE:CAG) makes and sells products under various brand names that are available in supermarkets, restaurants, and food service establishments. Naturally, Conagra ranks among the top defensive stocks to buy because it feeds a critical human need. We, humans, don’t perform so well without a daily minimum intake of calories.Financially, it must be stated that Conagra doesn’t quite feature the same magnitude of green ink as other recession-resistant stocks. Perhaps most problematic when it comes to the balance sheet, Conagra’s cash-to-debt ratio sits at 0.01. That’s crazy low for the consumer packaged goods industry and frankly other sectors.However, Conagra enjoys a solid net margin of 6.59%. Also, the market prices CAG at a forward multiple of 12.84. As a discount to projected earnings, Conagra ranks better than 70.14% of the competition. Looking to the Street, analysts peg CAG as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target lands at $41.92, implying over 13% upside potential.Estee Lauder (EL)A businessman ripping his shirt off to reveal an upward green arrow with the word buy on it underneathSource: ImageFlow/Shutterstock.comAn American multinational cosmetics company, Estee Lauder (NYSE:EL) is a manufacturer and marketer of makeup, skincare, fragrance, and hair care products. While it might not be everyone’s first idea for defensive stocks to buy, Estee Lauder could be quite relevant. In particular, with companies recalling their workers back to the office, the incentive to look presentable accelerates. That should be net beneficial for EL.Another reason to consider EL as one of the recession-resistant stocks centers on its financials. While it doesn’t enjoy the strongest balance sheet ever, the cosmetics giant features an Altman Z-Score of 6.19, reflecting robust resilience against potentially incoming headwinds. Operationally, the company features an okay three-year revenue growth rate of 6.6%. However, this stat might rise with the back-to-office movement. Also, its net margin pings at 9.13%, beating out 77.25% of its peers.Finally, analysts peg EL as a consensus strong buy. Their average price target stands at $290.50, implying over 14% upside potential.Anheuser-Busch (BUD)a green button on a keyboard has an arrow pointing upward with the word ""Buy"". representing safe stocks to buySource: AdityaB. Photography/ShutterStock.comTheoretically offering consumers some liquid relief, Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD) got into some hot water recently because of its partnership with a social media star. Long story short, conservative commentators objected to Anheuser’s Bud Light brand working with Dylan Mulvaney, a TikTok star who documented her gender transition journey. To be fair, the move seems risky because consumer demographics data reveals that Republicans more so than Democrats prefer light beer brands, including Bud Light.However, as I wrote for Fintel, other companies generated far worse controversies, scandals that actually hurt millions of households. Yet, those enterprises did just fine in the end and that might be the case for Anheuser. Financially, the metrics undergirding BUD stock could use some work. However, Anheuser is profitable, featuring a net margin of 10.33%. This stat ranks better than 66.18% of its peers, making BUD one of the top defensive stocks to buy.Lastly, analysts peg BUD as a consensus moderate buy. Their average price target stands at $74.67, implying almost 16% upside potential.On the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.A former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

351,a63afefc-508b-3e0c-8ca2-92e73dc686b7,ADP,2023-04-22,Top 15 Cloud Computing Companies in the World,Insider Monkey,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/top-15-cloud-computing-companies-202451124.html,1682108691,STORY,"['AMZN', 'CRM', 'DBX', 'NVDA', 'WDAY', 'IOT', 'IBM', 'NOW', 'SPLK', 'ADSK', 'VMW', 'VEEV', 'ADP', 'TEAM']","[In this piece, we will take a look at the top 15 cloud computing companies in the world. For more companies head on over to Top 5 Cloud Computing Companies in the World. The growth of technology has created new markets and changed the manner in which people live their lives and businesses run their operations. While the computer and the microprocessor on their own have enabled users to compute billions of instructions in the blink of an eye, the true disruption from technology takes place in tandem with the rise of the Internet. Data from the popular internet speed testing firm Ookla, global internet speeds have grown from 0.5 megabits per second (Mbps) to 107 Mbps as of July 2021.This high speed connectivity has generated growth in a relatively nascent industry called cloud computing. The Internet's role in cloud computing growth is clear from the fact that these technologies have been present since the 1970s when computers were first linked together to allow for resource sharing. This also led to a growth in enterprise resource computing and firms such as SAP SE (NYSE:SAP) which enable companies to manage their production and other resources efficiently. However, things only took a head at the turn of the millennia, with Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) allowing its customers to 'rent out' cloud computing resources and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) delivering software over the Internet. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) joined in soon as it provided a system for developers to develop applications over the Internet, and even the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) pitched in by providing the world's first open source software for creating private and semi private cloud computing networks.These days, cloud computing is used far and wide in both the enterprise sector and by the general consumer. One of the most well known examples of cloud computing is Dropbox, Inc. (NASDAQ:DBX)'s online platform that enables users to remotely share their documents and other resources. While on the surface Dropbox being a cloud computing firm might sound counterintuitive due to the term 'computing', in fact, cloud computing is defined by three distinct yet interrelated services. These are platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (PaaS), and software as a service (SaaS). Out of these, Dropbox is a SaaS company since it provides people with access to a virtual platform located on its hardware through an easily accessible interface.Story continuesOn the corporate side of things, cloud computing is quite prevalent as well. These uses are spread across a variety of industries, from sectors ranging from hospitality and restaurants to biotechnology, banking, and production and logistics optimization. According to the consulting firm McKinsey, the coronavirus pandemic was a massive stimulant for the cloud computing sector. It outlines that prior to the devastating global pandemic, companies planned to spend less than half of their information technology budgets on cloud computing by 2021. However, the pandemic led to this spending growing to 80% of the budget by 2024. A large motivating factor behind this spending is the cost benefits offered by cloud computing, as according to McKinsey, the segment can generate an additional $1 trillion in operating income. For the uninitiated, operating income is the income of a firm after direct and indirect costs are accounted for but taxes and interest payments are not subtracted. On a side note, cloud computing was also central in Moderna, Inc. (NASDAQ:MRNA)'s fight against the coronavirus, as the firm built its messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) research platform on a public cloud, which enabled it to scale up research of, and rapidly design, the Spikevax coronavirus vaccine.As a whole, the global cloud computing market was worth $484 billion in 2022 and should grow to $619 billion by the end of this year according to a report from Grand View Research. From then until 2030, the sector is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.1% and sit at a final value of $1.5 trillion by the end of the forecast period.Looking at the situation on the ground, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s chief financial officer Mr. Brian Olsavsky commented on the firm's AWS cloud computing division during Amazon's Q4 2022 earnings call conference where he highlighted:Net sales increased $21.4 billion in Q4, up 20% year-over-year and now representing an annualized sales run rate of more than $85 billion. Starting back in the middle of the third quarter of 2022, we saw our year-over-year growth rates slow as enterprises of all sizes evaluated ways to optimize their cloud spending in response to the tough macroeconomic conditions.As expected, these optimization efforts continued into the fourth quarter. Some of the key benefits of being in the cloud compared to managing your own data center are the ability to handle large demand swings and to optimize costs relatively quickly, especially during times of economic uncertainty. Our customers are looking for ways to save money, and we spend a lot of our time trying to help them do so. This customer focus is in our DNA and informs how we think about our customer relationships and how we will partner with them for the long term. As we look ahead, we expect these optimization efforts will continue to be a headwind to AWS growth in at least the next couple of quarters. So far in the first month of the year, AWS year-over-year revenue growth is in the mid-teens.That said, stepping back, our new customer pipeline remains healthy and robust, and there are many customers continuing to put plans in place to migrate to the cloud and commit to AWS over the long term.With these details in mind, let's take a look at some of the top cloud computing companies in the world, with the top ones being Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL).Top 15 Cloud Computing Companies in the WorldAI Generated ImageOur Methodology To find the top cloud computing companies in the world, we started by listing down all publicly traded firms that provide cloud computing products and services. Then, those, such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) whose primary business model is in a different industry were removed.

Today's event is being recorded for replay. This discussion will include a number of forward-looking statements. If you will refer to P&amp;G's most recent 10-K, 10-Q and 8-K reports, you will see a discussion of factors that could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from these projections. As required by Regulation G, Procter &amp; Gamble needs to make you aware that during the discussion, the company will make a number of references to non-GAAP and other financial measures. Procter &amp; Gamble believes these measures provide investors with useful perspective on underlying business trends and has posted on its Investor Relations website, www.pginvestor.com, a full reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures. Now I will turn the call over to P&amp;G's Chief Financial Officer, Andre Schulten.Story continuesAndre SchultenGood morning, everyone. Joining me on the call today are Jon Moeller, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer; and John Chevalier, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Execution of our integrated strategies drove strong results in the January to March quarter. Organic sales grew across all 10 categories and in 6 out of 7 regions. Global aggregate market share is holding steady. Productivity savings are accelerating and enabling sustained investment in the superiority of our brands. In-market execution across all 5 vectors of superiority is strong and consistent: product, package, communication, go-to-market and value. Superior offerings continue to pay benefits for our consumers and retail partners and, in turn, for P&amp;G shareholders. Progress against our plan enables us to increase guidance for organic sales growth and cash return to share owners and to maintain guidance for core EPS growth and free cash flow productivity. Moving to third quarter numbers. Organic sales grew more than 7%. Pricing added 10 points to sales growth, and mix was a modest positive contributor for the quarter. Volume declined 3 points, including a 1 point headwind from portfolio reduction in Russia. Growth was broad-based across business units with each of our 10 product categories growing organic sales. Feminine Care was up low teens. Personal Health Care, Home Care and Hair Care each grew double digits. Grooming, Oral Care and Fabric Care grew high single digits. Baby Care was up mid-singles, and Family Care and Skin and Personal Care grew low singles. Growth was also broad-based across geographies with 6 of 7 regions growing organic sales. Focus markets grew 5% for the quarter. Organic sales in the U.S. were up 6%, including modest unit volume growth. Europe-focused markets were up 8%. Greater China organic sales were up 2% versus prior year as the market begins to recover from COVID lockdowns and as consumer confidence improves. We continue to expect further recovery as consumer mobility increases over the coming quarters. Longer term, we expect China to return to mid-single underlying market growth rates for our portfolio of categories. Enterprise Markets were up 15% with Latin America up nearly 30%, and Europe enterprise markets up low teens. This is the fourth consecutive quarter in which all 5 sectors grew organic sales double digits in enterprise markets. Global aggregate value share was in line with prior year with 30 of our top 50 category country combinations holding or growing share. Excluding Russia, global value share was up 20 basis points. In the U.S., all outlet value share was up 40 basis points versus prior year, with 8 of 10 categories holding or growing share in the quarter. U.S. volume share is up 90 basis points versus the prior year driven by 2 points of absolute volume consumption growth in a market that is still down modestly versus prior year. Strong U.S. share growth in Personal Care has been led by innovation on the native brand and deodorants as well as successful extension into body wash. Cascade Platinum Plus has driven strong share growth in auto dishwashing, and Dawn share continues to be up more than 1 point with ongoing leverage from the powerwash and easy squeeze innovations. Vicks continues to be a growth leader in Personal Health Care, and we've delivered strong share growth in the Metamucil and Pepto-Bismol brands. In Europe, the new 4-chamber area of platinum pots are driving strong consumer demand in Fabric Care. Fairy Power Spray is growing the dish category and building market share in Home Care. The new Gillette Labs exfoliating razor, male and female intimate grooming innovations and cardboard packaging upgrades are driving strong growth in Grooming.Moving to the bottom line. Core earnings per share were $1.37, up 3% versus prior year. On a currency-neutral basis, core EPS increased 13%, good progress as we faced $0.31 per share of cost and foreign exchange headwinds in the quarter. Core operating margin increased 40 basis points. That 150 basis points of gross margin expansion were partially offset by SG&amp;A investments and inflation impacts. Currency-neutral core operating margin increased 160 basis points. Productivity improvements were a 290 basis point help to the quarter. Adjusted free cash flow productivity was at 92%. We returned $3.6 billion of cash to share owners, approximately $2.2 billion in dividends and $1.4 billion in share repurchase. Last week, we announced a 3% increase in our dividend, again, reinforcing our commitment to return cash to shareowners. This is the 67th consecutive annual dividend increase and the 133rd consecutive year P&amp;G has paid a dividend. In summary, against what is still a challenging cost and operating environment, continued good results across top line, bottom line and cash for the third quarter. Our team continues to operate with excellence, executing the integrated strategies that have enabled strong results over the past 4 years and that are the foundation for balanced growth and value creation, a portfolio of daily use products, many providing cleaning, health and hygiene benefits in categories where performance plays a significant role in brand choice. Ongoing commitment to and investment in irresistible superiority across the 5 vectors of product, package, brand communication, retail execution and value. We are again raising the bar on our superiority standards to reflect the dynamic nature of this strategy. Productivity improvements in all areas of operations to fund investments in superiority offset cost and currency challenges, expand margins and deliver strong cash generation. An approach of constructive disruption, a willingness to change, adapt and create new trends and technologies that will shape our industry for the future. Finally, an organization that is incredibly more empowered, agile and accountable with little overlap or redundancy, flowing to new demands, seamlessly supporting each other to deliver against our priorities around the world. There are 4 areas we are driving to improve the execution of the integrated strategies: Supply Chain 3.0, digital acumen, environmental sustainability and employee value equation. These are not new or separate strategies. They are necessary elements in continuing to build superiority, reduce cost to enable investment and value creation and to further strengthen our organization. Our strategic choices on portfolio, superiority, productivity, constructive disruption and organization are interdependent strategies. They reinforce and build on each other. When executed well, they grow markets, which in turn grow share, sales and profit. We continue to believe that the best path forward to deliver sustainable top and bottom line growth is to double down on these integrated strategies starting with the commitment to deliver irresistibly superior proposition, consumers and retail partners. Now moving to guidance. As we work towards the end of the fiscal year, we are cautiously optimistic. We remain confident in our strategies and the organization's ability to execute them with excellence. We continue to expect more volatility in the macro and consumer environment and expect sustained pressure in costs and foreign exchange as we move forward. On the whole, our consumer markets remained relatively resilient with U.S. and China volume trends improving, but with inflation pressures in Europe weighing more heavily on consumption. We continue to think the strategies we've chosen, the investments we've made and the focus on execution and excellence have positioned us well to manage through this volatility over time. Raw and packaging material costs, inclusive of commodities and supplier inflation, have largely stabilized over the last few months but still remain a significant headwind versus last fiscal year. Based on current spot prices and latest contracts, we now estimate a $2.2 billion after-tax headwind in fiscal '23. Foreign exchange is also a significant year-on-year headwind, and rates since last quarter have moved modestly against us. Based on current exchange rates, we now forecast a $1.3 billion after-tax impact to the fiscal year. Freight costs have moderated throughout the year, and we now expect them to be roughly in line with prior year. Combined headwinds from these items are now estimated at approximately $3.5 billion after tax or $1.40 per share, a 24 percentage point headwind to EPS growth for the year. In addition to these impacts, we are also facing higher inflation in wages and benefits and higher year-on-year net interest expense. We are offsetting a portion of these cost headwinds with price increases and productivity savings. We are continuing to invest in irresistible superiority, and we are investing to improve our supply capacity, resilience and flexibility. As noted in the outset, our strong results over the first 3 quarters have enabled us to raise our organic sales outlook and confirm our guidance ranges on EPS and cash. We are increasing our guidance for organic sales growth from a range of 4% to 5% to approximately 6% for the fiscal year. This would put fiscal '23 in line with 6% top line growth we've averaged over the last 4 years, which were 5, 6, 6 and 7 from fiscal '19 to '22, respectively. On the bottom line, we're maintaining our outlook of core earnings per share growth in the range of in line to plus 4% versus prior year. Significant headwinds from input costs and foreign exchange keep our current expectations towards the lower end of this range. This guidance also reflects our intent to remain fully invested to drive our superiority strategy and increase investments as value-creating opportunities are available. We continue to forecast adjusted free cash flow productivity of 90%. We now expect to pay nearly $9 billion in dividends and to repurchase $7.4 billion to $8 billion in common stock, combined a plan to return $16 billion to $17 billion of cash to shareowners this fiscal year. This outlook is based on current market growth estimates, commodity prices and foreign exchange rates. Significant additional currency weakness, commodity cost increases, geopolitical disruptions, major production stoppages or store closures are not anticipated within this guidance range. To conclude, we continue to face highly volatile consumer and macro dynamics. We also continue to see high year-over-year input costs, inflation in the upstream supply chain and in our own operations, headwinds from foreign exchange, geopolitical issues and historically high inflation impacting consumer budgets. As we said before, we believe this is a rough patch to grow through, not a reason to reduce investment in the long-term health of our business. We're doubling down on the strategy that has been working well and is delivering strong results. We continue to step forward. We remain fully invested in our business. We remain committed to driving productivity improvements, to fund growth investments, mitigate input cost challenges and to deliver balanced top and bottom line growth. With that, we'll be happy to take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) The first question comes from Lauren Lieberman of Barclays.Lauren Rae LiebermanGreat. I wanted to talk a bit about productivity. Because over the last, I guess, 2.5, 3 years during the pandemic and all the global supply chain challenges, productivity was something that understandably took a back seat. And then this quarter, really seen this significant change in what you've been able to realize. So I was curious if there's -- we should be thinking about productivity as something where there's like a catch-up, where there's sort of projects that have been on the list, things you're able to get at, so that productivity could run at an elevated rate going forward. And it's also interesting, I think, in the context of marketing how you've been so consistent in investing throughout. There's actually no catch-up on the marketing piece. No need to accelerate reinvestment per se, but maybe some, again, acceleration on the productivity side. So I'd be curious to hear about that.Andre SchultenGreat. I think with -- as you said, we are catching up right now to return to gross savings levels that are equal or close to equal to those that we've delivered pre-COVID. We have more line capacity available for us to qualify cost savings, more mind space of our teams to be able to identify new opportunities. And as we are able to engage suppliers and get through this inflationary period, hopefully, more ideation and new projects to be created as well. As we've talked on our Investor Day, we see runway on productivity for the next few years driven by Supply Chain 3.0. We have talked about delivering about $1.5 billion of savings with those initiatives between automation and digital capabilities. And we continue to believe that we can generate between $400 million to $500 million a year from media programmatic savings, both in terms of scheduling and buying capabilities around the world. Those programs will hold productivity, in my estimation, close to pre-COVID levels, which will allow us to continue to reinvest in media, which will allow us to fund innovation and superiority. And that is really the intent of the model. So to answer your question directly, I would not expect a disproportionate catch-up, but I would expect a steady return to pre-COVID levels of net structure savings, both costs and media.Jon R. MoellerI agree.OperatorThe next question comes from Bryan Spillane of Bank of America.Bryan Douglass SpillaneI actually had just one clarification and then a question. Clarification, the $125 million of, I guess, incremental interest expense, can you just give us a little bit more color on that? And again, is that something we need to kind of contemplate in our models as even we look past the fourth quarter? So I guess is net interest expense going up?Andre SchultenYes, I mean, obviously, it is, right? Markets are getting more expensive in terms of credit, and we are not immune to that. So the $125 million BT we've quoted for this year, I would expect the trend to continue to go up into next year. Now we are still well positioned relative to peer group because we're able to borrow not only in the U.S. but also in euro, in pounds and in yen. So that keeps us very competitive. But nevertheless, we're not immune to those increases, so they will continue to go up into next year.Jon R. MoellerAnd just one piece of perspective there, Bryan, this is Jon. We've understandably, because it's been the primary driver of cost increases, focused our discussion on commodities. But that's not the only cost increase that we're seeing. We've just talked about interest expense. Andre mentioned in his prepared remarks wages and benefits, which continue to increase. So I would just encourage us all to gain confidence from what's happened here, but to realize that there are still, as Andre said, many headwinds that we're working against and we'll continue to work against as we move forward through next fiscal year.OperatorThe next question comes from Dara Mohsenian of Morgan Stanley.Dara Warren MohsenianGuys, can you hear me?Jon R. MoellerYes.Andre SchultenWe can.Dara Warren MohsenianSo on the gross margin side, you were up significantly year-over-year in the quarter for the first time in a couple of years. Obviously, some nice sequential progress with the outsized cost savings and the strong pricing. But also your full year commodity assumptions and freight assumptions are a bit better than they were previously. So just wanted to get a sense if we start to see this sustained improving gross margin environment, what's your perspective on the bias to sort of reinvest that upside back into marketing versus let it drop to the bottom line? This quarter, obviously, with the magnitude of gross profit upside, you could do both. But just wanted to get a sense on how you think about that going forward. And if I can slip in a second part, are you comfortable you're getting a strong ROI on the higher ad spend presumably, obviously, did this quarter, but how do you think about that going forward and sort of ROI on any spend that may be opportune or incremental than what you originally expected?Andre SchultenWe would expect progress on the gross margin side. Actually, we're encouraged by the productivity numbers that have helped us on top of pricing to deliver the first modest increase in gross margin after a very long period of heavy cost headwinds impacting us to the negative side. And as we've done this quarter, we will continue to look for value-creating opportunities to reinvest. We firmly believe the reason why we are able to grow the top line at the range we are growing, the reason why we are able to hold volume share and value share globally in a very tough environment is because of our superiority-driven innovation across product, package, communication and retail execution. And we believe that as pricing goes into the market and the consumer is even more, I think, sensitive towards the value equation that they are being offered, continued investment across all of those vectors is going to create value and serve us well going forward. So we will maintain the flexibility to do so, but we will do it in a disciplined and in a very ROI-driven way, as you say. As to your second part of the question, as ad spending becomes more efficient with our ability to in-house both scheduling and buying of media, more digital capability to be more targeted, that increases the ROI of every dollar we can spend. So it actually makes investment in media spending more attractive. At the end of the day, we will maintain the concept of balance between top line growth, bottom line growth and cash generation to stick with our ongoing growth model and value creation model.Jon R. MoellerJust building on Andre's points, which I fully agree with, I want to come back to this notion of balance and our commitment to it. Some of you have heard me talk about this probably many times, but it's worth repeating, so you understand how we're thinking about things. We have a chart that we use with the leadership team every time we gather, which shows what you would have to believe to deliver top third total shareholder return, which is our objective entirely through the top line or entirely through the bottom line. And to do it entirely through the top line, you'd have to assume that we can grow 8% from an organic sales standpoint each and every quarter, which is, in our view, unrealistic. If you try to do it entirely through the bottom line, you'd have to assume that you could expand margins 180 basis points per year. So 5 years, 10 margin points in a highly competitive industry, where it's taken us 187 years to build 22 margin points, equally unlikely. So we are very committed to driving both top line and bottom line. It's the only way we see to get home. I have a trite little saying that we use on occasion, which is top line with no bottom line, a waste of time. Bottom line with no top line, just a matter of time. We're going to continue to operate in that vein. And if we're successful, you'll see top line growth driven by proper levels of investment and bottom line growth and margin expansion, modest margin expansion. One last thing on the point of advertising rate of return, our ROI. In addition to what Andre was talking about, we simply have, though it may be hard to believe, a lot of low-hanging fruit that's out there. We have many categories where we are not at our target levels of reach. And that's a very high ROI activity. When we can reduce waste and frequency, reinvest that into expanded reach, very good things happen as you've seen, by the way, not just this quarter, but for the last 4 years. And there's no reason to change that approach at this point in time.OperatorThe next question comes from Steve Powers of Deutsche Bank.Stephen Robert R. PowersSo overall volume this quarter came in roughly in line at least with our expectations, but both price and mix delivered upside, which I think implies just better structural elasticity than we were expecting. And I guess the question is, as you balance everything, just your relative confidence that, that can continue. On the one hand, you have some tailwinds for sure that as China comes back and service levels seem to be improving, your reinvestment rate is admirable as we've been talking about. But there's obviously uncertainties out there. And so I guess maybe just a little bit of perspective on your overall confidence and where that confidence is more versus less elevated.Andre SchultenI'll try a careful balance here between giving you perspective on the global basis and not letting you get ahead of yourself in terms of expectations. But the volume decline is better than we would have expected. As you said, our elasticities remain favorable on an aggregate basis. And if you look at global markets, we actually see volume consumption stabilizing. So you would have seen in previous quarters, global volumes across our categories down roughly 3 to 4 points. In our most recent [read] which is the past 1 month, volumes are actually down 70 basis points. This is market volume. And if you exclude Russia, probably more around flat. That's with China returning to some level of growth, and it's also with pricing moving into the base. So we'll see as pricing becomes more annualized, we'll see that stabilization. I don't know if it's going to continue to be neutral. I would expect some level of negativity in terms of overall market volumes but certainly improving sequentially. Within that, I think we're taking comfort in the fact that we are able to hold global volume share and global value share despite significant pricing that we are taking, which is enabled, as we said, we believe by our superiority strategy, a strong vertical portfolio, both tiers and price points and being present in all channels where consumers want to shop. In our biggest, most important market, as we had in our prepared remarks, we were able to grow volume and volume share 90 basis points over the past 3 months. So that's the positive side. On the negative side, Europe continues to be a high-pressure environment. We've been able to grow sales 8% in focus markets, but that was a very strong pricing contribution with negative volumes in the range of 7%. And the European consumer is trading into private label. We see the price differential between private label and branded competitors increasing as private label is delaying price increases. The consumer continues to be under pressure there. So that's going to be a continued headwind, I think, from the volume side. Overall, I think our outlook is balanced. We -- as we said, we expect market growth to return to 3% to 4% on the value side. And there has to be a positive volume component to that going forward, but it will take a few quarters before we get there.OperatorThe next question comes from Kevin Grundy of Jefferies.Kevin Michael GrundyCongratulations on another strong set of results. I thought maybe we could spend a moment on China and the reopening there, of course, given the importance of that market for you guys being the second largest market behind only the U.S. So up 2% sequential improvement, which is encouraging. We see that in the China retail sales, including cosmetics, continues to show sequential progress. You've been consistent about your target of mid-single-digit growth for that market longer term. However, it also seems plausible that you potentially exceed that level of growth, at least in the intermediate term here, given easier year-over-year comps and then maybe the potential for some inventory rebalancing at retail as consumer demand improves. Can you comment a bit more on what you're seeing in China and then perhaps offer some broader views on the pace of the recovery and how you see that playing out?Jon R. MoellerKevin, this is Jon. I'll hand it over to Andre to give some more numerical perspective. But I thought it might help just to share briefly the trip that myself and a large contingent of our leadership team were able to make to China in the last 3 weeks. We spent more than a week there. It was wonderful to reconnect with our organizations who are doing a tremendous job. We spent time in consumer homes. We spent time with our retail partner leaders in their stores and in their offices. And of course, we spent time with various government authorities. And without getting into all the details, the bottom line conclusion was a very positive one and much more than I was expecting even.And I'm kind of a China fan, having worked there many years ago, having lived there. So my expectations already started high, and those were exceeded. Having said that, and we talked about this on the last call, this is not going to be a vertical restart. And there will be a number of twists and turns, including some of the ones that you've mentioned, along the way. As Andre said in his prepared remarks, we expect China to continue to contribute at a meaningful level over the middle to long term. But everything looks reasonably positive and constructive. Andre, do you have any other perspective on that?Andre SchultenNo, I think you said it. I think the other component we're not yet seeing is any return of Chinese consumers to travel retail. That is a significant negative for us in the SK-II business specifically. So that, hopefully, we see a more positive trend there in the near future. That's the only other upside that I think we have. But as Jon said, I think the recovery of 2% organic sales in the quarter is very consistent with what we would have expected.OperatorThe next question comes from Robert Ottenstein of Evercore ISI.Robert Edward OttensteinGreat. Just a quick follow-up on -- or clarification on some of the numbers and then my real question. So the clarification is, I think you mentioned that mix is a positive impact on sales, but it was a slight negative drag on the gross margin. So I'd just like to understand that. And then my focus question really is if you could go into more detail on the U.S. business and the U.S. consumer. You mentioned that you saw an improving U.S. consumer, so any kind of clarification around that. And then an update on your pricing in the U.S., how much you saw in the quarter, how much more is there to go in the next quarter and any kind of impact that you're seeing, any granularity on that would be appreciated.Andre SchultenOn the gross margin and sales connection here from a mix perspective, the effect that you're seeing here is product mix. So consumers, when they come into our P&amp;G portfolio, tend to trade up into higher-value items. We've seen that actually consistently over the past quarters. So that, as they trade up into higher unit sales, that's a positive impact from a mix perspective on the top line. But those higher unit sales items also have higher unit profit, but the gross margin in percentage is slightly lower for some of them. When you think about adult incontinence, for example, when you think about Fabric Care single-unit dose versus liquid detergent, gross margin percentage lower, unit sales higher, unit profit higher. So it's a positive effect both from the top line and the bottom line standpoint, but the percentage mix is lower. U.S. consumer, I think, is holding up well. As we said, any indication that we see on our business is that the consumer is still choosing P&amp;G brands. We are growing volume share in a market that is still down on volume. We are growing absolute volume. So 90 points volume share growth, 40 basis points value share growth, fairly consistently across periods.We also see private label share stable at 16%, really no movement here over the past 1, 3, 6, 9 months, which is a good indication that we don't see any material trade down. Now we're watching this very closely. And we believe that a lot of that is again driven by our very intentional strategy to drive superiority. We continue to invest in innovation. We'll continue to invest in product packaging innovation. We're increasing, as Jon said, communication frequency and reach, where we see a good payout and return. We continue to work with our retail partners to ensure that the presentation of our brands online and in-store is as good as it can be. Last element I would call out is we are stable in terms of supply and on-shelf availability, which is also helping our overall position in the market. So stable, I think, is the characterization, but we're watching carefully.Jon R. MoellerAnd just one additional point, the 6% top line organic sales growth that the team delivered in the quarter and as Andre said, sales share -- value share growth and volume share growth. We still have a couple of categories where we are not supplying full demand. That will be remedied here fairly quickly. But as you consider the strength of the U.S. consumer, if you look at those key measures and realize that there -- whether are both opportunities and risks within the number, there are opportunities as well as risks, which continue to point to a relatively healthy U.S. consumption pattern.OperatorThe next question comes from Peter Grom of UBS.Peter K. GromSo I wanted to ask about the changes in the commodity and freight outlook. Second straight quarter that these headwinds have moved lower, which is nice to see. Can you maybe just give a sense what you're seeing within that bucket, where are costs moving lower and where are costs still sticky? And while I don't expect you to comment on '24 at this point, but maybe just conceptually, how you see inflation evolving as we look out over the next 12 to 18 months?Andre SchultenFreight is relatively stable at this point in time. As we've mentioned in the prepared remarks, we expect our freight and transportation and warehousing costs to be roughly in line with prior year. And I think that is a reflection of a more balanced capacity situation with the driver-to-load ratio returning to, I think, more historical norms. Again, given fuel prices and all other dynamics, I wouldn't expect any major change going forward, but we're at least stable. From a commodity basket standpoint, we continue to see a mixed bag. We have some help in resin-based commodities. We have some help in pulp. So that is moderated by mill shutdowns for maintenance, both planned and unplanned. But on the other side, all our high-energy usage materials, when you think about caustic soda, think about ammonia, all of those are increased in pricing. So the moderation is really limited, and it's not consistent across the basket. So $100 million after tax is the only thing we're seeing at this point in time. We also continue to see upstream in the supply chain. Our suppliers continue to try to recover their input cost increases, their labor inflation. And that continues to be a discussion that is ongoing. I think as we mentioned in CAGNY, some of those contracts roll over 12 months, 18 months. So there's -- these headwinds and these discussions will continue to be with us. Overall, we're expecting, as we always do, spot rates will hold on. That's what's based on underlying our planning for next year and our guidance for this year.OperatorThe next question comes from Andrea Teixeira of JPMorgan.Andrea Faria TeixeiraSo how should we think about the upside in Beauty? And both you, Jon, and Andre spoke briefly about travel retail being an upside in Asia. How should we be thinking also on the other side lapping the triple pandemic and the respiratory benefit you had in health care? It seems you could benefit from digestive recently. But how should we be thinking about the other segments? And as we -- just a clarification. As we put in the embedded organic in the fourth quarter is at 4%, but it seems as if you are -- as Andre commented, the exit rate on your volume is potentially flat, bear in mind, of course, the potential risk in Europe. But should we be thinking more of a better quality in terms of the delivery in organic? So even though it would be a 300 basis point deceleration on a sequential basis, you'd still have better volumes, maybe flattish to maybe only slightly down and a 4% price component in there.Andre SchultenOn the category-specific questions, yes, we see SK-II as a potential beneficiary of travel retail reopening. Overall, SK-II is recovering well outside of that channel. In China Mainland, we saw 8% growth in the quarter. In Japan, we saw 46% growth in the quarter, but the overall results are still held back by travel retail. So I think we will see a sequential improvement, but there are many gives and takes in the overall Beauty Care sector. So that needs to be seen in context with a lot of other dynamics that are going on around the world. On the Personal Health Care side, we continue to be very pleased with the results the team is delivering there. And we see sustained growth in this space across respiratory, digestive, nerve care. There are many parts of that portfolio that have very high growth potential. And in some of these areas, as we've talked before, we're still held back by supply constraints, which might provide upside in the future. But again, we have a combination of 10 categories across multiple markets. Some of them will do well in a period of time. Some of them will be held back by negative headwinds. So we continue to strive for a balanced top and bottom line growth picture. It will be driven by different parts of the portfolio of different types. From a volume versus price component standpoint, what is important to understand is quarter 4, we will start to lap price increases for the first time. So we had about 8% of pricing in the base. So that will be a negative headwind to the top line growth in quarter 4. And while we see stabilization of volumes, I would expect that there still will be negative volume component to the growth in the near future. We have still Russia portfolio being with us as a negative headwind, China slowly recovering but not yet in positive territory from a volume perspective. And as I mentioned earlier, the European consumer is under a lot of pressure with private label pricing not yet following the branded competition in those markets. So pricing will come into the base. That will be a headwind to the top line. I would expect still a negative volume component in quarter 4.Jon R. MoellerYes. One thing to remember too, is that we've just taken pricing in both the U.S. and Europe. And I don't think that the data for the current quarter reflects the potential volume impact from some of that pricing. So I would be looking at volume recovery -- volume to slowly improve over time, but it won't happen overnight.OperatorThe next question comes from Filippo Falorni of Citi.Filippo FalorniJon, clearly, you've gone through a lot of transformation over the past 5, 6 years at the company, both from a portfolio standpoint, organizational standpoint, superiority. Can you help us understand how you think internally these changes can help you navigate a potentially weaker consumer environment if what we're seeing in Europe were to expand into the U.S. and some other parts of the world?Jon R. MoellerSure. And Andre may have some thoughts here as well. The -- what I really like about the strategic choices that we've made and the approach that we're taking currently is that it is the strongest approach I can think of for a very healthy economic environment or a very difficult economic environment. The indicated actions don't change. So think, for example, about our -- embedding productivity is a fundamental part of our DNA. That's something that serves us very well in a positive economic environment as critical in a downward economic environment. The importance of superiority to consumers in categories where performance drives brand choice, critical in both a good economic environment and a difficult economic environment. Focus of the portfolio on daily use categories where performance drives brand choice and superiority within each of those categories across product, package, communication, go-to-market and value for consumers and customers. I just -- I don't see anything in that, that I would change if we -- I mean, obviously, tactically, there'll be some different decisions on the margin. But the broad underlying approach sets us up very well even if -- or particularly if we end up in a more difficult environment.OperatorThe next question comes from Olivia Tong of Raymond James.Olivia Tong CheangOne more follow-up on pricing, particularly on the new pricing, whether your view in terms of elasticities relative to previous rounds of pricing have -- whether they've changed or stayed similar to what you've seen already. And to the extent that you can draw some conclusions on markets where pricing is now starting to lap versus markets where you're still rolling out price hikes, can you just compare and contrast what you're seeing, especially since you're starting to see some modest volume growth in the U.S.?Andre SchultenThe most recent rounds of pricing have gone into effect just in February and March across -- and I'm calling out across Europe and U.S. because those are most visible. So it's hard for us, as Jon said, to determine what the outgoing elasticities are at this point in time. What I can tell you is that elasticities remain stable, remain favorable. And I think it is also a function of continued investment. It is a function of continued innovation. Every price increase or most price increases are connected to innovation, meaningful innovation for the consumer. That also guarantees retail support. They are linked to strong value communication. We've talked about area cold water, tight cold water, Charmin rollback or Olay value communication. And that is meaningful for consumers as they come under pressure. Many of our categories are categories where the consumer doesn't want to risk failure. You don't want to wash your clothes twice, and you certainly don't want to deal with a diaper failure. So all of that, I think, is helping us to maintain favorable elasticities across the board. The most important insight for us is, and that's what you see us doing in Q3, we need to continue that investment. We need to look for opportunities where our value is exposed, and I'll call out Europe as an example because of private label pricing at a lower pace than the branded competitive set. It is critically important that we maintain that investment level to maintain the value equation. Where we see pricing lapping or I think where we have the strongest portfolio and the strongest execution in terms of innovation and superiority, we see favorable results, and the U.S. is a good example of that. Excellent in-market execution by the team compared with a truly strong portfolio and strong innovation is delivering both relatively strong results to the balance of market but also driving market growth and recovery.OperatorThe next question comes from Chris Carey of Wells Fargo Securities.Christopher Michael CareyCan you just talk about your playbook in Europe? You've noted European product label is delaying price increases a number of times on this call. We've heard similar commentary from others in [staples]. If price gaps to private label remain wide, do you simply accept that new level? Or you need -- do you need to do something about it to be a bit more offensive to close the gap? And I guess I say that in the context of Europe, of course, but also as a bit of a litmus test for price competition that could play out globally in the months ahead, the course ahead and just how you think about managing through that type of dynamic.Andre SchultenYes, I'll start, Chris, and then I'm sure Jon will add. I think the team is accepting the reality of an extended or expanded price gap versus private label. That's the challenge they need to deal with. And as Jon frequently says, we wake up every Monday morning and deal with the reality in front of us. This is the reality we need to deal with. So what that means is we need to create innovation, we need to create product and packaging innovation, communication strategies and in-market executions that are able to provide value to consumers and retailers. And that's what we're focused on. I don't think that trying to eliminate the price differential is a meaningful and helpful strategy for us. But if we can generate growth via innovation and via superiority, that's both helpful for us and the market and the path forward we're choosing.Jon R. MoellerI couldn't agree more. And frankly, while Andre rightly points to a difficult consumer environment, if you look at our results thus far in Europe, they're very encouraging, not just in the last quarter, but through last fiscal year as well. We're achieving growth rates in Europe that are higher than we've seen in a long time. And so now is not the time to back off, it's time to move forward and strengthen the execution just as Andre described. That doesn't mean we have our heads in the sand. We've made several adjustments to price gaps, not just versus private label, but versus branded competition as we've gone through this period of pricing, and we need to continue to be sensitive to that. But first and foremost, we need to delight consumers and customers with the offerings that we're bringing to market and go from there.OperatorThe next question comes from Jason English of Goldman Sachs.Jason M. EnglishCongrats on strong results. A couple of quick questions. So first, on pricing, can you give us some more quantification on perhaps breadth and magnitude? And when you blend it all together, what sort of order of magnitude should we expect at the consolidated level in terms of organic sales contribution going forward? And then secondly, SG&amp;A. Love to see the reinvestment back in the business but really sharp sequential change, both in terms of year-on-year for overall SG&amp;A and just sequential dollar step-up. Can you unpack a bit more kind of where the money is, what's -- where the extra investment is going?Andre SchultenYes. Pricing magnitude, the latest round of pricing is fairly consistent with what you would have seen in the past, but it's very tailored to the market, as we said before. Mid-single digits, I think, is the ballpark I would give you for the latest increase. And I think pricing over time will move back to be a contributor to top line but not the sole contributor to top line. So we need and the market needs to find a balance here over the next few quarters to return to modest volume growth and pricing contribution to return these categories to mid-single-digit growth. That's what we're working towards. On the SG&amp;A line, look, a lot of our reinvestment is driven by innovation timing, so when are the right initiatives in market to double down on. They are driven by pricing timing. So when do we and can we support our brands as we take pricing and drive innovation. What I would tell you is the latest push we had as a management team to our earlier discussion was to really double-click on our sufficiency in Europe and to see how high is up, what -- how hard can we push, especially the media and communication side in terms of value communication across Europe. So that's the one area I will give you where we paid a lot of attention over the last 3, 4 months.Jon R. MoellerI would just add one thing. It's our category leaders that determine the level of investments that we're making at any point in time. And prior to this quarter, just as you go back in time, there were more situations where we weren't able to fully supply demand. And obviously, those are situations that you -- you continue to invest in mental awareness and -- but not spike that investment because you can't supply it. And as we get into an increasingly better supply environment as we did the last quarter, you resume a level of spending now that you can fully support it. So that's a part of the dynamic in addition to the dynamic that Andre described.OperatorThe next question comes from Mark Astrachan of Stifel.Mark Stiefel AstrachanYes. Wanted to ask sort of related 2-part question, more about U.S., but I suppose you could talk globally if relevant. How sticky do you think this strategy of irresistible superiority is in terms of volumes? Obviously, we see that you're gaining share if you look at the U.S. So you're effectively trading consumers to higher-value products that work better than peer sets, right? So it would suggest that there's a stickiness here that perhaps didn't exist in kind of prior cycles. So I'd be curious how you think about that and how it flows through from a volume standpoint going forward. And related to that on just the volumes, what's your best guess as to why volumes are down from a consumer standpoint? Is it pantry destocking, unloading? Does that imply that there potentially is reloading at a later time if and when consumer sentiment improves?Andre SchultenMark, I'll take a first crack. I think the concept of irresistible superiority is A, dynamic and must be dynamic; and B, is relevant across value tiers. So as consumers get more careful with their spending, for example, that just means we need to double down on our view of what superiority in some of our lower-value tiers means. So you think about diapers in the U.S., for example. We have Luvs, which is about half the price of a Swaddlers diaper. And that means that we need innovation on Luvs because we're now competing with private label, that we need to make sure as consumers look for value, that brand can stand on its own from a product, packaging, communication and retail execution standpoint to provide value to those consumers. So it's really not a strategy that by default drives trade-up. It's a strategy that follows the consumer and is grounded in what the consumer needs and wants over time. So if we get more stress, that just means we need to double-click on the type of innovation and investment we need. From a consumption standpoint, as pricing goes into the market, we generally see consumers reacting with what you've described. If there are pantry inventories available, they, for a period of time, draw down those inventories. And recall, coming out of the pandemic, I think Jon mentioned this earlier, there were increased pantry inventories available across multiple categories. So I think that's part of the effect that we've seen. I wouldn't expect any major restocking because I think we're just returning to more normal levels. As supply stabilizes, as kind of the COVID pandemic goes more into the past, I think consumers return to their normal behaviors. The other element we're seeing is more careful usage. If you're overall made aware of inflation in everyday media, every day, you look twice before you use another paper towel, et cetera. And partially, that's part of our value communication, right? When we talk about Charmin rollback because the product is more absorbent and has more strength, we explicitly talk about the ability for consumers to use less. So it's really driven in those elements. Again, I think the job that we have as market leaders in many of our categories is to drive volume growth back to sustainable levels, and there are many levers. We still have huge household penetration opportunities around the world in many of our categories. We can create new usage occasions, create regimen use across many of our categories. So those are the things we're focused on.OperatorThe next question comes from Nik Modi of RBC Capital Markets.Sunil Harshad ModiI just wanted to follow up quickly on China. Jon, maybe just given that you were there recently, just on-the-ground consumer behavioral insights, like what are they going through right now? Are they just hesitating, and it's kind of like a choppy, hey, maybe I'll check out outside and see if I get sick? I mean just any perspective on kind of how the consumer is actually behaving on the ground.Jon R. MoellerYes. You can imagine with what many of them have been through, there's a bit of a whiplash aspect to -- for 3 years, I was told that going outside was dangerous. And now I'd be encouraged to reemerge. I'm living probably in a relatively small dwelling, many times with multi-generations. And I don't want to negatively impact my family. So there is a degree of hesitance and questioning. On the same time, there's an overwhelming feeling, at least as I experienced it, of liberation, of hope. And I was in Beijing one sunny Saturday afternoon, and the streets were packed. It was absolutely wonderful and joyous. So I continue to hold on and believe in the mid- and long-term opportunities that China presents us with. It's certainly -- plus 2 is a lot better than a negative number that we had in the last couple of quarters. So there is clear improvement. But I think it will be a little bit choppy. And all it will take is a little bit of nervousness to stop the reacceleration of the growth. But I would -- my takeaway, Nik, is a positive one but with near-term caution.OperatorOur final question comes from Edward Lewis of Atlantic Equities.Edward James LewisYes. I guess I just -- covered a lot of ground, but I'd be interested just on the Enterprise Market performance. Just looking in particular at Latin America, I think you said, Andre, something like 30% growth this quarter. And I think that will be an acceleration of around 20% in the first half. Presumably, there's a healthy element of price behind that, but would be -- just be interested to hear on what's driving this improved performance in that region.Andre SchultenThere is a very healthy element of pricing there like in every other region because we're pricing not only for commodities, but we're also pricing for foreign exchange rate exposure in all of these markets. I think the positive effect is the volume is holding much better than in some of our focus markets. The consumer strength is there. I think the overall strength of the brands is better than we've ever seen. In-market execution is better than we've ever seen. Retail partnerships are better than we've ever seen. So all of that, I think, is contributing to a strong price component with a positive volume component, and that drives the 30% result of that number.Jon R. MoellerYes. Just for perspective, in our 2 largest markets in Latin America, Brazil and Mexico, as Andre is saying, we're seeing volumes high single digit. So I don't want you to take away that all of the sales growth, as Andre has already said, is pricing. It's a healthy combination. And I also need to give a nod to the team in Latin America, who is just doing a fantastic job. Listen, I want to close up with just a couple of comments and reflections. And the first relates to what we've been through and what I think it portends for the future. And then I'll come in and talk a little bit more about the quarter that we just completed. But if we had a conversation 3 or 4 years ago, and you told me, look, here's what's going to happen. We're going to have this thing called the global pandemic. People are going to die. Borders are going to be closed. You aren't going to be able to get to your largest markets, and they aren't going to be able to get to you. You're going to have difficulty in getting your colleagues into manufacturing facilities, innovation centers, sales offices. But don't worry, that's not all. We'll have the largest land war in Europe since World War II. The combination of foreign exchange and commodity cost inflation is going to wipe out half your earnings. You're going to see dramatic channel shift in some of your largest markets in terms of where consumers are doing their shopping. And when all that's over, you're going to find that it's difficult to get people to come back to work. How do you think you're going to do? And my answer to that 3 or 4 years ago would be that -- wow, do you think you can grow top line, bottom line, deliver cash and return that to shareholders through all that? Without taking you through the details, what you know very well, that's exactly what this team has done. Over the 4 years that ended last fiscal year, they created $13 billion in incremental sales, $5 billion in incremental profit. Now if you bring that forward and look at what happened, what they accomplished in the last quarter, broad-based sales growth, sequential progress in shipment volume, value share, volume share, a return to gross margin expansion, strong productivity savings, at the same time, a healthy reinvestment in the top line and advancing our level of superiority, our margin of difference, in-market growth in household penetration. If those are the kinds of things our investors want to see, they're there in spades in the quarter that we just delivered. Last point, I promise, but we've talked several times, both Andre and I, about the challenges ahead, and they're real. We will continue trying our level best to do -- to serve consumers, customers, each other, society and clearly, share owners. But it's going to be, just as it has been, a bit choppy. And we're taking a long-term approach here. And if there are choices that are right for the long term that cause bottom line difficulty in the near term, we're going to make those choices. And we'll talk more about that as we approach guidance for next year. But if you're thinking across mid and longer periods of time, I think we've got a great setup here, a great strategy, a great set of capabilities that should enable us to serve all those constituents that I mentioned very effectively. But we're thinking about that in years, not quarters. Thank you very much.OperatorThat concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a great day.]"

Next week will see a flood of reports, including from megacap tech and growth companies whose shares have helped the S&amp;P 500 rally to start the year.“The market has been basically in a bit of a holding pattern ahead of big tech earnings next week,” said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer at Truist Advisory Services. ""There is a tug of war between good and bad economic data, good and bad earnings data.”According to preliminary data, the S&amp;P 500 gained 3.89 points, or 0.09%, to end at 4,133.68 points, while the Nasdaq Composite gained 13.82 points, or 0.11%, to 12,073.37. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 23.05 points, or 0.07%, to 33,809.67.Story continuesResults next week are due from some of the highest-valued U.S. companies including Microsoft, Google parent Alphabet and Amazon. Amazon shares rose on Friday after a research firm predicted the online retailer's business in North America would beat Wall Street's estimates.The materials sector fell, weighed down by declines in Freeport-McMoRan Inc and Albemarle Corp . Albemarle slumped after Chile unveiled plans to nationalize the lithium industry.

Three stocks that we're watching in the final 30 minutes of trading. We've got Procter &amp; Gamble, Amazon, and Eli Lilly. Kicking off with Procter &amp; Gamble, one of the movers in today's trading, up just about 3 and 1/2 percent after the company beat on earnings and raised its sales outlook, driven by an uptick in demand and also higher prices for products like detergent and its diapers. P&amp;G isn't seeing much pushback it doesn't seem yet here from customers after raising prices by about 10% across its brands.While P&amp;G said that consumers are not trading down, CEO Jon Moeller did tell Yahoo Finance that people are being a little bit more cautious, they're being more careful in their usage of the product that they've bought. We have Diane King Hall here on set with us. And Diane, when you take into account, I guess it's a little bit of an optimistic tone, given the fact that we have seen consumers really pull back. So, they're using it more cautiously, but they're still spending on those brand items.DIANE KING HALL: Spending, but maybe it's one-ply instead of two-ply. I mean-- [LAUGHS] The one thing-- no, never go one-ply.- No.[LAUGHTER]DIANE KING HALL: Right. That's an absolute nonstarter. Exactly. That is not where we cut corners. No, but the one thing they did talk about, for instance, the paper towels, Bounty paper towels. It is hard to find a good competitor for that, but they said people are maybe, like, doing the select a size, using a little less of the paper towel. So, that's where they're making the trade.SEANA SMITH: --as well.DIANE KING HALL: [LAUGHS]No, they're still cleaning, cause, you know, maybe. I don't know. I hope they're not reusing the paper towel.- Now, we are seeing, though, fourth straight quarter of declining volumes for P&amp;G, which is an interesting number. Now, they're being offset, of course, by inflation. The volumes are down 3%, but prices up 10%. So, they talk about inflation being a headwind. It's really the reason they continue to eke out gains. Although, their CFO-- they don't break it down this way in the earnings report-- their CFO actually said volumes are up in the United States. It's globally that they saw 3% decline.DIANE KING HALL: Right.]"

Multiples are still at 18 times earnings. There is lots of excess in equity markets that needs to be unwound.""U.S. stock indexes have been rangebound this week with investors seeking clues on how far the Fed could hike interest rates, while earnings have signaled resilience in big banks though most regional lenders reported deposit outflows in the wake of a banking crisis last month.A slate of Fed speakers this week voiced support for another 25-basis-point rate hike by the U.S. central bank at its May 2-3 meeting. Traders have priced in an 82% chance of such a move, with many expecting the Fed to hold rates before cutting them by the end of 2023.Fed Board Governor Lisa Cook is set to take the stage on Friday before the central bank's policymakers enter a blackout period until the next policy meeting.At 11:39 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 51.39 points, or 0.15%, at 33,735.23, the S&amp;P 500 was down 5.02 points, or 0.12%, at 4,124.77, and the Nasdaq Composite was down 6.65 points, or 0.06%, at 12,052.91.Tesla Inc gained 0.7% after raising U.S. prices for its Model S and X premium electric vehicles.Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.74-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.37-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq.The S&amp;P index recorded 18 new 52-week highs and four new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 128 new lows.

These stocks can potentially be a good investment option for investors who are looking to purchase stocks at a discount and hold them for the long term. If an investor can identify a stock that is undervalued due to temporary factors, such as a downturn in the industry or a negative news event, they may be able to purchase the stock at a lower price and benefit from the potential upside when the temporary factors subside.Growth stocks have outperformed value equities in the past as they offer the potential for higher returns and capital appreciation. However, the consistent changes in monetary policies and growing inflation have turned investors’ attention toward value stocks. According to a report by UBS, value stocks surpassed growth equities by 18 percentage points in the first 10 months of 2022. The report mentioned that inflation above 3% has generally fared well for value stocks historically. In addition to this, tight monetary policies also favor value stocks relative to their growth counterparts. The UBS report revealed that value has historically outperformed growth by an average of 4 percentage points, in the 12 months following the bank’s last rate hike in a cycle.Readers can also have a look at 11 Undervalued Dividend Aristocrats to Buy to know more about value investing.Investors consider value stocks because of their solid long-term returns.

So, with dividends included we’ve made 28% cumulatively over 5-years.

We’ll continue to own this company unless the shares become meaningfully overvalued, and if it gets cheaper, we would be very comfortable owning more.”8. T. Rowe Price Group, Inc.

UDR, a premier multifamily real estate investment trust (REIT), is set to announce its first-quarter 2023 earnings results on Apr 26 after market close. The company, known for owning, operating, acquiring and developing high-quality apartment communities across the United States, has been a strong choice for investors seeking exposure to the flourishing multifamily real estate sector.In this preview, we will discuss UDR's recent performance, the resurgence in the U.S. apartment market, and what investors can expect from UDR's first-quarter 2023 earnings.Q4 2022 RecapIn the last reported quarter, this Denver, CO-based residential REIT came up with funds from operations (FFO) as adjusted per share of 61 cents, in line with the consensus mark. The quarterly results reflected a year-over-year rise in revenues, driven by healthy operating trends and past accretive external growth investments. However, higher same-store expenses were a headwind.In the last four quarters, UDR’s FFO as adjusted per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate on one occasion and met the same on the other three, the average surprise being 0.42%. The graph below depicts the surprise history of the company:United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. Price and EPS SurpriseUnited Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. price-eps-surprise | United Dominion Realty Trust, Inc. QuoteU.S. Apartment Market ReboundFirst-quarter data from RealPage Market Analytics shows that the U.S. apartment market has experienced a rebound in net apartment demand, ending a streak of three consecutive quarters of negative absorption. The market added 19,243 net new renters in the quarter, signaling a return to positive territory. Occupancy rates continued to slide but at a much lesser degree than before, coming in at 94.7% in March, matching the pre-pandemic decade average.In March, same-store effective asking rents for new lease signers increased 0.3%, with effective asking rents up 3.9% year over year, marking the first time below 4% since April 2021. These trends suggest that somewhat normal seasonality is returning to the market after a three-year absence due to the pandemic.Story continuesQ1 2023 Expectations for UDRWith the resurgence in the U.S. apartment market, it's likely that UDR will capitalize on positive trends to deliver a strong performance in the first quarter of 2023. The rebound in net apartment demand is likely to have resulted in healthy occupancy rates and rental growth, driving revenues for the multifamily REIT.Per its first-quarter 2023 Investor Presentation, UDR’s blended lease rate growth accelerated from December to February. This supported its first-quarter 2023 blended lease rate growth expectation of 3.3% to 3.9%. We estimate same-store physical occupancy at 96.7%.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is currently pegged at $404.46 million. This indicates a 13.2% year-over-year rise. This growth is anticipated to be fueled by the recovering demand for rental housing, high occupancy rates and rent growth.Additionally, UDR enjoys a decent balance sheet position and banks on technological moves and process enhancements to fuel growth. This residential REIT focuses on enhancing cost control through its Next Generation Operating Platform. UDR projected first-quarter 2023 FFO as adjusted per share in the range of 59-61 cents.Before the first-quarter earnings release, the company’s activities were not adequate to gain analysts’ confidence. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarterly FFO as adjusted per share has remained unchanged at 61 cents in the past month. However, this suggests year-over-year growth of 10.9%.Potential Risks and ChallengesDespite the optimistic outlook, UDR faces certain risks and challenges that could impact its first-quarter 2023 performance. These include potential headwinds from interest rate hikes, which could increase borrowing costs and affect the company's ability to refinance existing debt.We expect interest expenses to grow 17.1% year over year in the first quarter. Furthermore, the multifamily real estate sector could face oversupply concerns, leading to increased competition and lower rent growth.Here Is What Our Quantitative Model Predicts:Our proven model does not conclusively predict a surprise in terms of FFO per share for UDR this season. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of an FFO beat, which is not the case here.UDR currently carries a Zacks Rank of 3 and has an Earnings ESP of -1.46%. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.However, our model shows that Equity Residential EQR and Independence Realty Trust, Inc. IRT have the right combination of elements to report a surprise this quarter.Equity Residential is slated to report quarterly numbers on Apr 25. EQR has an Earnings ESP of +0.31% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3 presently.Independence Realty Trust, scheduled to report quarterly numbers on Apr 26, has an Earnings ESP of +4.82% and carries a Zacks Rank of 3. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.ConclusionInvestors will closely monitor UDR's first-quarter 2023 earnings results to evaluate the company's ability to capitalize on favorable market conditions and maintain its growth trajectory. With a strategic focus on high-demand markets, strong demographics and a robust balance sheet, UDR seems well-positioned to deliver solid results in the first quarter of 2023, benefiting from the rebound in the U.S. apartment market. However, investors should remain mindful of potential risks, such as interest rate increases and oversupply, which may impact the multifamily real estate sector.Note: Anything related to earnings presented in this write-up represents funds from operations (FFO) — a widely used metric to gauge the performance of REITs.Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Shares of the company gained about 5.6% in the key trading session on Apr 20.DHI reported adjusted earnings of $2.73 per share for the fiscal second quarter, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.90 by 43.7% but decreasing 32.3% from the year-ago figure of $4.03. Total revenues (Homebuilding, Forestar, Rental and Financial Services) were $7.97 billion, down 0.3% year over year. The reported figure topped the consensus mark of $6.56 billion by 21.6%.Although, earnings and revenues declined on a year-over-year basis due to prevailing softness in the market, the company highlighted that net sales orders increased 73% from the fiscal first quarter, defying the prevailing higher mortgage rates and inflationary pressures.The company believes that the housing demand will remain favorable, courtesy of a limited supply of new and existing homes at affordable price points despite challenging market conditions, comprising higher rates and uncertain economic conditions.Segmental DetailsHomebuilding revenues of $7.47 billion decreased by a meager 0.5% from the prior-year quarter. Home sales were $7.45 billion, slightly down from $7.5 billion reported a year ago. Home closings were down 0.8% from the prior-year quarter to 19,664 homes.Net sales orders were down 5% year over year to 23,142 homes. The value of net orders also declined 11% year over year to $8.6 billion. The cancelation rate (on gross sales orders) was 18%, up from 16% a year ago.FY23 ViewDHI expects consolidated revenues of $31.5-$33 billion (versus $33.5 billion in fiscal 2022). Homes closed are anticipated to be 77,000-80,000 units. For the Rental business, the company expects homes closed within 4,000-5,000 units.

However, compared to March 2022 it dropped 0.9%. The year-over-year declines in price have been seen for two successive months following a long period of price increases.The U.S. housing market saw 131 consecutive months of year-over-year median sale price increases, the longest streak on record, before experiencing two successive months of decline. Moreover, the mortgage rates may decline in the medium term as the Fed might act less-hawkish ahead on cues of cooling inflation.Against the above-mentioned backdrop and the upbeat DHI earnings results, investors may tap housing ETFs like iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ITB and SPDR S&amp;P Homebuilders ETF XHB.

366,1edcaf05-5c55-3bc2-8c38-65573c895e7a,AAL,2023-04-22,5 Broker-Friendly Stocks to Monitor Amid Current Uncertainty,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/5-broker-friendly-stocks-monitor-112111831.html,1682076071,STORY,"['DLEKG.TA', 'DK', 'AAL', 'CVI', 'CLF', 'DAL']","[With the Q1 earnings season still in its initial stages, investors would like to add stocks with the potential to surpass earnings expectations to their respective portfolios. This is because an earnings beat generally leads to stock price appreciation. However, the task of designing one’s portfolio with potential outperformers is quite a daunting one. The task becomes even more difficult in this scenario of high inflation and the resultant uncertainty and slowdown in consumer spending. Naturally, individual investors will find it next to impossible to design a winning portfolio of stocks without proper guidance amid this turbulence.The choice of improper stocks can adversely impact returns, ruining the objective of investing one’s hard-earned money in the highly unpredictable stock market. In a bid to avoid such a scenario, investors usually rely on guidance from proper sources.In the field of investing, brokers are deemed to be experts with thorough knowledge. We believe that investors should include broker-favorite stocks like American Airlines AAL, Delta Air Lines DAL, CVR Energy CVI, Cleveland-Cliffs CLF and Delek US Holdings DK in their watchlistWhy Broker Guidance is the Need of the HourBrokers, irrespective of their types (sell-side, buy-side or independent), have at their disposal a lot more information on a company and its prospects than individual investors. To attain their objective, they go through minute details of the publicly available financial documents apart from attending company conference calls and other presentations.  Broker opinion should thus act as a valuable guide for investors while deciding their course of action (buy, sell or hold) on a particular stock.Since brokers indulge in meticulous research, the question of their actions being arbitrary does not arise. The direction of the estimate revisions serves as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock. Given the expertise of brokers in investment matters, it is natural for investors to believe that there is a solid reason/logic behind their improving the recommendation on a particular stock.To take care of the earnings performance, we have designed a screen based on improving analyst recommendation and upward estimate revisions over the last four weeks.Story continuesIgnore Top line at Your Own PerilTo design a winning strategy, it is not prudent to consider the bottom line only. In fact, according to some market watchers, a top-line outperformance is more creditable for a stock than a mere earnings beat under some circumstances. Therefore, to make our strategy full-proof, one needs to address top-line concerns as well. We have considered the price/sales ratio, which serves as a strong complementary valuation metric, for screening stocks.Screening Criteria# (Up-Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter.Price-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio, the better. Companies meeting this criterion are in the bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks.Price greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely be of significant interest to most investors.Average Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.Market value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 in terms of market capitalization.Com/ADR/Canadian= Com: This takes out the ADR and Canadian stocks.Here are five of the 10 stocks that passed the screen test:American Airlines is based in Fort Worth, TX. The gradual increase in air-travel demand (particularly for leisure) is aiding AAL. However, high fuel costs are hurting the bottom line.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for AAL’s 2023 earnings has been revised 14.8% upward. American Airlines currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.Delta, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 2, is based in Atlanta, GA. DAL is being bolstered by an uptick in demand for air travel (particularly for leisure). Driven by higher air-travel demand, total revenues increased 36.5% on a year-over-year basis in first-quarter 2023.High fuel costs are, however, a bane. Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for DAL’s 2023 earnings has been revised 3.1% upward.CVR Energy is an independent refiner and marketer of high-value transportation fuels. CVI is also a producer of ammonia and urea ammonia nitrate fertilizers. Its petroleum business includes a full-coking sour crude refinery in Coffeyville, KS. The company’s efforts to reward its shareholders underline its strong financial position. The robust Nitrogen Fertilizer unit supports growth.CVR Energy, currently sporting a Zacks Rank #1, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the past four quarters by an average of 40.85%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 42.1% over the past 60 days.Cleveland-Cliffs is a leading iron ore producer in the United States. It supplies differentiated iron ore pellets under long-term contracts to major blast furnace steel producers in North America. The Mining and Pelletizing operation gains from low-cost, high-quality iron ore pellet production with substantial logistics and transportation advantages to serve the Great Lakes steel market. The company should gain from its merger with AK Steel Holding Corporation.Over the past 60 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for CLF’s 2023 earnings has been revised 13.7% upward. Cleveland-Cliffs currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).Brentwood, TN-based Delek US Holdings is an independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. DK’s extensive downstream operations within the Permian Basin grant it a fairly significant competitive edge over its peers in the long term.Delek US Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #3.

367,7cdc8d59-8b17-3a8a-baa5-b49e9549f2df,AFL,2023-04-22,Are You Looking for a High-Growth Dividend Stock?,Zacks,https://finance.yahoo.com/news/looking-high-growth-dividend-stock-154503013.html,1682091903,STORY,['AFL'],"[Whether it's through stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other types of securities, all investors love seeing their portfolios score big returns. However, when you're an income investor, your primary focus is generating consistent cash flow from each of your liquid investments.Cash flow can come from bond interest, interest from other types of investments, and of course, dividends. A dividend is that coveted distribution of a company's earnings paid out to shareholders, and investors often view it by its dividend yield, a metric that measures the dividend as a percent of the current stock price. Many academic studies show that dividends make up large portions of long-term returns, and in many cases, dividend contributions surpass one-third of total returns.Aflac in FocusAflac (AFL) is headquartered in Columbus, and is in the Finance sector. The stock has seen a price change of -7.59% since the start of the year. The insurer is currently shelling out a dividend of $0.42 per share, with a dividend yield of 2.53%. This compares to the Insurance - Accident and Health industry's yield of 2.54% and the S&amp;P 500's yield of 1.72%.Looking at dividend growth, the company's current annualized dividend of $1.68 is up 5% from last year. Over the last 5 years, Aflac has increased its dividend 5 times on a year-over-year basis for an average annual increase of 11.72%. Looking ahead, future dividend growth will be dependent on earnings growth and payout ratio, which is the proportion of a company's annual earnings per share that it pays out as a dividend. Aflac's current payout ratio is 30%. This means it paid out 30% of its trailing 12-month EPS as dividend.Looking at this fiscal year, AFL expects solid earnings growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 is $5.59 per share, which represents a year-over-year growth rate of 4.88%.Bottom LineInvestors like dividends for many reasons; they greatly improve stock investing profits, decrease overall portfolio risk, and carry tax advantages, among others. But, not every company offers a quarterly payout.Story continuesBig, established firms that have more secure profits are often seen as the best dividend options, but it's fairly uncommon to see high-growth businesses or tech start-ups offer their stockholders a dividend. During periods of rising interest rates, income investors must be mindful that high-yielding stocks tend to struggle. With that in mind, AFL is a compelling investment opportunity. Not only is it a strong dividend play, but the stock currently sits at a Zacks Rank of 3 (Hold).Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Price and EPS SurpriseUniversal Health Services, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Universal Health Services, Inc. Quote Factors to NoteRevenues of Universal Health are expected to have benefited on the back of solid contributions from its Acute Care Hospital Services and Behavioral Health Care Services segments in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Acute Care Hospital Services unit’s net revenues is pegged at $1,960 million, indicating an improvement of 2.5% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.The consensus mark for net revenues in the Behavioral Health Care Services segment stands at $1,472 million, suggesting 7.8% growth from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.Higher patient volumes are likely to have driven revenues of the Acute Care Hospital Services segment in the to-be-reported quarter. Additionally, the unit is expected to have been aided by prudent expansion initiatives in the form of inaugurating acute care hospitals.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for same-facility adjusted admissions in acute care hospitals indicates a rise of 3.3% from the prior-year quarter’s reported figure.Meanwhile, the growing incidence of mental health issues among Americans is expected to have sustained the solid demand for services provided by the Behavioral Health Care Services unit.Story continuesHowever, the bottom line of Universal Health is likely to have suffered a blow in the first quarter from escalating labor costs stemming from the continued scarcity of nurses and other medical personnel. Higher physician subsidy expense is expected to have dampened the growth prospects of the Acute Care Hospital Services unit. Also, improved interest rates are likely to have increased interest expenses for UHS in the to-be-reported quarter.What Our Quantitative Model PredictsOur proven model does not conclusively predict an earnings beat for Universal Health this time around.

I'll turn the call over to Richard, who will make some opening comments, and then we'll come back and review the prepared slide materials and then take your questions. Richard?Story continuesRichard C. AdkersonThank you, Kathleen, and thank you all for joining us. Kathleen will review the results of the quarter and our outlook, and I'll join our team in responding to your questions. I'm pleased with our global team's responses to challenges we faced in the first quarter. You all know mining is a tough business that's evidenced by the recent reports throughout the industry. Who you are in our industry is defined by your responses to challenges. I'm very proud of who we are at Freeport. Our team in Indonesia once again proved resilient and overcoming a major flood event. Now we're accustomed to dealing with rainfall at Grasberg. It's located high in the mountains of New Guinea, one of the wettest places on the globe. We just celebrated our 56th anniversary of operating there. Our systems are designed to handle significant rainfall. The intensity of the event we experienced in January was unusually severe. Our established systems prevented major damages. Our team bounced back quickly by taking immediate actions to restore production and mitigate future risk, and we have a great start in the second quarter with operations there. Kathleen and I have made a series of trips to Indonesia in recent months. For me, it's personally gratifying to experience the markedly more positive attitudes there about Freeport in years past. All this resulted from the partnership we established with the government in 2018. The success we have achieved in the multiyear large-scale development of our underground operations and the positive outlook for copper in the future.Grasberg has now returned to rank as the world's second largest copper mine. Our net cash cost of production at Grasberg in the first quarter was a negative $0.08 per pound. We are now working positively with the government to extend PT-FI's operating rights beyond 2041 in a way that benefits all stakeholders. At Cerro Verde, our team negotiated through a volatile period of political turmoil in Peru. Our team rallied around the community and our workforce to handle the situation in a remarkable fashion. Our U.S. team is stepping up to overcome the challenges associated with labor availability in the United States. We appreciate the commitment and drive of the global Freeport team to reach our goal in challenging circumstances. Copper markets continue to be supported by low levels of inventories, China is accelerating economic recovery and the ongoing positive global demand drivers for copper. Our customers continue to buy all the copper we can produce and seek more. As we move forward, copper miners will be required to expand production to meet demand. At Freeport, we're in a strong position to develop new sources of copper supply to grow our business from our vast brownfield resources and also to grow our business from the rapidly developing leach technology and supporting data analytics.At Freeport, we benefit from strong franchises and support from communities where we operate. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet. We have an exemplary track record for success in project and operations execution. Focused execution is the backbone of our culture at Freeport. We have a clearly defined strategy and a relentless drive for achieving long-term success. And Kathleen will now review our slides.Kathleen Lynne QuirkThank you, Richard. And I'll start on Slide 3. You've probably seen, we published our annual report and our sustainability report today and the reports are available on our website. The theme of this year's annual report is The Power of Copper. It highlights the critical role at Freeport and our principal product copper play in powering the global economy and the growing uses of copper as the world decarbonizes and reimagines modern infrastructure to support a highly connected world. We're also proud to publish our annual sustainability report. We've been reporting on our comprehensive sustainability initiatives for 22 years now, and transparency continues to be enhanced. The report summarizes our initiatives, our achievements and the challenges that we face in managing the safety, social and environmental aspects of our business, which are critical to our long-term success.We use international standards, best practices and third parties such as the Copper Mark to measure our performance and responsibility to our stakeholders. We hope you'll have the chance to review this information and engage with us on these topics. We'll turn to Slide 4, which summarizes our key operating and financial highlights in the first quarter. As previously disclosed, our Grasberg operations were temporarily disrupted in February following a significant weather impact in our mill area. As Richard said, the team did a great job to safely restore production to normal levels in March. Despite the lower volumes compared with our estimates going into the quarter, our consolidated unit net cash costs were essentially in line with our guidance.Consolidated cost per unit averaged $1.76 per pound in the quarter as higher byproduct credits more than offset the volume impact. As Richard mentioned, notably, even with the disruption Grasberg unit net cash costs averaged a net credit of $0.08 per pound, meaning the gold revenues more than offset the cash cost of production. With the return to normal operations in March and a great start in April, we expect our volumes to be strong in the balance of the year. Our margins in the quarter were strong. Our EBITDA totaled $2.2 billion in the quarter. Operating cash flows, which were net of $500 million use of cash for working capital totaled $1.1 billion. We funded investments during the quarter of $1.1 billion, that included about $400 million for major mining projects and $300 million for the Indonesian smelter, which is being funded from proceeds from financing we raised last year. Excluding net debt associated with the smelter, we ended the quarter with $1.3 billion in net debt. Our balance sheet, liquidity, financial flexibility are in terrific shape. The outlook is positive for free cash flow generation in the balance of the year.The next slide, Richard talked about the challenges we faced in the first quarter, and we faced these across our global operations. Our teams executed well in the circumstances, and you can see on the left, the production impact of the weather event at Grasberg in February and the strong recovery in March.In Peru, we and other mining companies experienced a challenging environment earlier in the year associated with widespread protests, which impacted supply chains and transportation routes. Our team at Cerro Verde did a great job managing the situation efficiently and safely. Situation in Peru has improved in recent weeks, and we're now operating at normal rates.In the U.S., we were challenged with ongoing labor shortages, extreme weather events earlier in the quarter and unplanned maintenance issues. We're working to improve productivity and reliability, working on skills development and pursuing technology and automation initiatives as we aggressively seek to recruit workers with ongoing tight labor market conditions in the U.S.The leach recovery efforts, which we'll talk more about, really helped to offset some of the shortfalls in mining rates, and we're going to continue to build on this.Turning to the markets on Slide 6. Freeport is well positioned as a leader in the global copper industry. Demand for copper is expected to accelerate going forward with projections for demand to double by 2035. Copper is essential in electrification. Low-carbon investments in renewable power and electrification are driving massive growth in demand. In addition, the initiatives by many countries from major infrastructure programs and the uses of copper for connectivity, data and artificial intelligence are also growing demand drivers.At the same time, the ability of the industry to meet this rising demand is a real challenge. All of us can look back at this time last year when many were projecting the market to move to a surplus in 2023, pointing to the new projects that were coming online. As we look at the situation today, most analysts now project the market to be balanced this year, even with the new projects.And longer term, the projections are for very large deficits. Under this backdrop, we believe prices will need to rise to incentivize new supplies. And at Freeport, we benefit from a large reserve position, as you see on the slide, and an even larger resource position to grow our business in the future. We're strongly positioned to continue to support growing demand and are pursuing several of these initiatives to enhance production going forward.On Slide 7, we talk about the molybdenum markets. And as we've discussed, in addition to being a leading copper producer, Freeport is the world's largest molybdenum producer. Last quarter, we spoke about the significant rise in molybdenum from $18 per pound in late 2022 to a high of over $38 per pound in the first quarter of this year. We realized $30 per pound for our molybdenum sales in the first quarter. The price rose sharply beginning in late 2022 in response to supply issues and favorable demand drivers in energy and aerospace sectors. The prices began to drive from the highs in recent weeks, partly related to improved supply. As we look forward, the demand drivers for moly are positive. And since moly is principally produced as a byproduct from copper mines, it's also subject to some of the same supply issues as we have in copper. Current price of moly approximates just over $21 per pound. We're really excited -- moving to Slide 8, really excited to talk today to give you an update on our leach initiatives, which Richard referred to earlier. Our efforts to increase copper production through enhanced recoveries from our massive leach stockpiles is continuing to gain momentum. Based on our results today, we're gaining increasing confidence in achieving our initial target of 200 million pounds per annum and have begun to model what the next phase could look like.On the left side of the chart, we summarized the various categories that make up the initial 200 million-pound target, basically in 3 buckets. The first is -- relates to heat, increasing temperatures within the stockpiles. The second is an initiative we call Leach Everywhere, which is focused on making sure the entire stockpile has the benefit of the liquid solution we use to leach copper.And the third category, which is really important, it involves data analytics using new data available through sensors used in a variety of ways, including optimizing the amount of solution used and the rate of application we use to achieve the best results. It's been proven that increasing heat in the stockpiles enhances recoveries.We've advanced the installation of covers on our stockpiles for heat retention, and we've mechanized the process, and that's allowed us to execute more efficiently. We now have over 30% of our massive stockpiles covered. These initiatives provide 30% of the targeted increase.The Leach Everywhere initiative makes up 50% of the uplift and uses targeted drilling to improve flow of the solution that may not be getting through the stockpile. We're also drilling injection wells to add the liquid solution to lower stockpile sections. The sensors we've installed and access to other technology used in oil and gas formations are providing new information on our additional leach solution would stimulate the process and support higher production.The data analytics works is providing new insights. We really haven't had the benefit of this in the past, and we're now able to get the benefit to determine the optimal operating protocols under various conditions of the stockpiles. The initial success of these initiatives adds production at low incremental costs and a low carbon footprint.In parallel with our initial activities, we've been doing substantial work on the drivers to stimulate leach production and have modeled results on what the next phase of initiatives could yield. We see an opportunity to add an additional 600 million pounds per annum from these initiatives, which would provide a total of 800 million pounds per year. That's the size of a major new mine without the capital intensity and a very low incremental operating cost. The 3 areas of focus are highlighted in the center of the slide, and we're in various stages of development on each of these initiatives. We've got a lot of work to do to advance these initiatives, and some of this requires further innovation, but we have a clear path to success in this program.We're evaluating opportunities to increase the temperature further by heating the liquid solution before application on the stockpile. We're evaluating options to do this using solar-generated power, geothermal or other renewable sources at our mine sites to accomplish the additional heat requirement. We're also testing various additives that we're developing both internally as well as from third-party initiatives.And we're using artificial intelligence in our journey and in our valuations to help expedite the process. We're also evaluating options to inject air into the stockpiles in areas that are not getting enough oxygen. Again, we have much more knowledge of what is going on within the stockpiles and are working to design solutions to restimulate copper production.Freeport is in an exceptionally strong position to lead the industry in this area with massive stockpiles currently under leach, ongoing mine leach for -- mine for leach activities and the latent tank house capacity that we have. This will be part of our growth plans as we go forward in addition to the organic growth that we have to develop new copper in traditional ways.And Slide 9 highlights the growth and development outlook. And as we look at growing copper demand and the limitations and risks and actionable greenfield project development, our strategy and development priorities are focused on extensions of our existing operations in our portfolio of brownfield opportunities.On Slide 9, we show our near-term, medium-term and longer-term development options. Following a significant growth in recent years achieved through the successful Grasberg development, we're focused on advancing the next phases. In the near term, we see the best options for growth in achieving our initial leach targets and actions to enhance productivity and reliability in our U.S. operations. If we can get our mining rates up in the U.S., which we're working on, and hit our targets for asset efficiency and reliability, we have the opportunity to add an additional 200 million pounds per year with limited capital investment.In the medium term, we've outlined a series of initiatives. The first includes the second phase of our leach project. We're also looking to expand our Bagdad mine in Arizona and expect to complete feasibility studies this year. We have a major opportunity in Chile at our El Abra project and where we already have an existing operation and looking to expand it significantly. And we're in the process of developing a new 90,000-ton-per-day block cave mine in Indonesia called Kucing Liar, which is currently in progress and expected to commence initial production by the end of the decade. At Bagdad, we're making some investments, which are included in our new capital expenditure guidance to conduct early works in the tailings area to enhance optionality and to move more quickly with the mill expansion project following completion of the feasibility study.Longer term, and we're already working on these projects as they require long lead times, we expect we'll have the opportunity for further major expansion in the Safford/Lone Star District, where we have an identified significant resource, and we have a series of U.S. brownfield projects that can be pursued.In Indonesia, Richard talked about the extension discussions we're having and the extension of our operating rights beyond 2041, would open the door for continuation of large-scale mining and potential additional development options in one of the world's largest and highest-grade copper and gold mining districts. We're in an outstanding position to continue our leadership role in supplying copper to a world of growing requirements. We're going to continue to be disciplined in our approach and focused on executing projects where we can create value for shareholders.On Slide 10, we provide an update of our 3-year outlook for sales volumes. We've updated the 2023 sales guidance to take into account the first quarter disruption and the impact of lower mining rates in the U.S. Despite the disruption at Grasberg in February, our gold volumes for 2023 are about 3% higher than prior estimates. We've incorporated the estimates for stronger gold recoveries than in our January forecast, and we're doing really well in that regard.The guidance for 2024 and 2025 is unchanged. But with continued success in our leach efforts, we have some upside to these estimates.On Slide 11, we show -- moving to cost, we show a comparison of our prior unit net cash cost guidance for 2023 compared to our current estimate. We currently estimate unit cash cost to average $1.55 per pound for 2023, that's slightly lower than our January estimate of $1.60 per pound. The impact of the lower copper volumes is offset by higher byproduct credits and a reduction in export duties in Indonesia associated with our smelter construction progress. Our assumptions for the key commodity-based input costs are similar to the January estimates.We're starting to experience less inflationary pressures in certain areas than in 2022, particularly for energy, while labor cost, services and equipment components have increased. In the reference slides on Page 23, you'll note an approximate 7% increase in site production and delivery costs for our U.S. mines compared with prior estimates.This largely reflects a reduction in volumes in the U.S. associated with the challenges we discussed earlier. And we've got ongoing initiatives to improve productivity there. Moving to our cash flows. On Slide 12, we show modeled results for EBITDA and cash flow at various copper prices ranging from $4 to $5 per pound of copper. These are modeled results for 2024 and 2025 with our current volume estimates and our cost estimates, and we hold gold flat at $2,000 and molybdenum flat at $18 per pound in these models. Our annual EBITDA under these scenarios would range from over $10.5 billion per annum at $4 copper to $15 billion per annum at $5 copper. And operating cash flows would range from $7.5 billion per year at $4 copper to $11 billion per year at $5 copper.We show some sensitivities to the various commodities on the right. And with our long-term long-life reserves and large-scale production we're really in a position to benefit from future metals-intensive growth trends and the prospects for increasing cash flows and cash returns under our performance-based payout framework.On Slide 13, we provide an update to our capital expenditures. Current forecast and these exclude the Indonesian smelter project, which is being funded with cash that we released last year in a bond offering. But our current forecast for 2023 totals $3.5 billion. That's up from the prior estimate of $3.4 billion, and capital expenditures for 2024 are currently forecast to approximately $3.3 billion.The change from our prior guidance principally reflects investments we're planning at Bagdad, to jump-start early works to support optionality for future expansion. The Bagdad investments or projects that we categorize as discretionary and do not reduce the cash available for distribution under our payout policy as they will be funded with the remaining 50% of free cash flow retained for growth projects.On Slide 14, we got some great pictures showing the construction of our new smelter in Indonesia. This is a major undertaking for us. It's impressive and it will be on a world-class scale. The project will become the world's largest single-line/copper smelting facility and it's advancing rapidly.We expect to commission the project in 2024. The project will include a precious metals processing facility and an expansion of the existing nearby smelter, and it will align with Indonesia's downstream policy and enable PT-FI to process all of its concentrates domestically. In closing, on Slide 15, we summarize our financial policy, which is centered around 3 priorities with the cornerstone being a strong balance sheet, and we've achieved that. Our balance sheet and liquidity are strong and provide significant financial flexibility for the future. We're executing the performance-based payout policy, which provides for 50% of our free cash flow to be allocated to shareholder returns in the form of dividends and share purchases and the balance available to invest in our projects.We'll continue to pay a base dividend and a variable dividend at a combined annual rate of $0.60 per share. And since commencing the performance-based payout policy in 2021, we've returned about 60% of our free cash flow to shareholders and it further strengthened our balance sheet along the way, providing capacity for funding new projects over time.We did not purchase shares in the first quarter but have availability under our share purchase authorization to conduct purchases, pursuant to the policy, and we have a positive outlook for substantial free cash flow generation in the future depending on prices and other factors. The 3 priorities of balance sheet strength, allocating cash flow to a mix of shareholder returns and organic growth, we believe will enhance long-term value for the benefit of our shareholders.Our global team is energized. We're motivated to continue building value in our business, and we're executing our plans responsibly, safely and efficiently. Thanks for your attention, and we'll now take your questions.Question and Answer SessionOperator(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.Christopher LaFeminaI actually have a bunch of questions, but I'll just ask one, and then I'll get back in the queue. There's a lot of M&amp;A activity happening in mining, obviously, at the moment, and copper seems to be a major focus. And I know -- I think Richard has talked a little bit about looking at M&amp;A opportunities in the past, but you obviously haven't done much in recent years. And I'm just wondering with your overall philosophy is around M&amp;A? Are there jurisdictions that you'd be focused on? Is it important to have operational synergies? Are there any kind of key criteria that you would consider or is it just really about being opportunistic? And then secondly, is M&amp;A something that is increasingly on your radar screen just as a result of consolidation in the industry in general?Richard C. AdkersonThanks, Chris. As you know well for a long time now, I've been saying that consolidation would come to our industry. It's inevitable because of the challenges in developing projects. And it's not just a price issue, it's really just the availability of actionable projects for companies to pursue and companies in our industry that are diversified companies have had copper at the top of their strategic list for a long time. It's notable of the overall lack of success in developing new projects. There have been a few, of course. So all those things come together and lead to what we're seeing going on right now with M&amp;A activity. Now for us, we don't have a strategy of growing through M&amp;A. We are focused on our large-scale inventory of reserves and resources that Kathleen described. And -- but that does not mean that we would not take advantage of opportunities that may arise. So we're not defining regions or any other criteria. We would only do something if it was clearly something that was value-enhancing for our shareholders. So we're not in a position of looking for things to do. But now with our company having made such great progress in strengthening our balance sheet, completing the major underground conversion at Grasberg and advancing on all fronts, we would be in a position if an opportunity arises, but it would only be in that case.OperatorNext question will come from the line of Emily Chieng with Goldman Sachs.Emily Christine ChiengMy question is just around the leaching technology that you've talked a little bit more about today. And I wanted to dig through the 600 million pounds of step change in leaching volumes there. I think as we talk about this third-party [analytical] leaching technology, I think that's been deployed at El Abra and Bagdad currently. What percentage of that 600 million pounds does that account for? And perhaps could you talk to the timeline to getting there? And whether or not this could mean the El Abra expansion -- mill expansion could be delayed further if there's a strong success there?Kathleen Lynne QuirkEmily, it's Kathleen, and I'll let Cory Stevens fill in on this because he's leading the efforts. But in terms of the additional 600 million pounds, a portion of it could be through these additives, but it's important to note that the additives that we're pursuing are both internal and through third parties. And we've got a trial going on with a relatively small stockpile at Bagdad, with [Jetty.] And we've got some new initiatives going on with Jetty at El Abra. But the bulk of what we're outlining here is initiatives that we can pursue on our own there. It's really not -- there's a lot of innovation involved and technology involved, but it's not rocket science. And the sensors and data that we have now is pointing us to where the issues are, where is the solution not getting through the stockpile, where is the stockpile not getting oxygen to it. So these things can add -- once we identify the problem, we, as an industry, can fix -- can find a solution.And at Freeport, we have such big stockpiles. That's why we have such a big opportunity here. So the bulk of what we're talking about, the opportunity we're talking about is largely at Morenci. Morenci is -- you see -- you look at our 38 billion pounds and look at the percentage of Morenci, and that's where the bulk of the opportunity is. But if we are successful with this, potentially at El Abra, it might -- it might, we don't know yet, but it might compete with traditional mill technology. But we're really looking at what's available now through third parties, but our initiative and our objective is to find a way to solve this on our own because that's the best way to maximize the yields for Freeport. But Cory, do you want to add anything to those comments?Cory StevensYes, Kathleen, no, you said it well. So -- our R&amp;D efforts, we've been chasing some internal leads that look very promising. And then in the first quarter, what we've been able to do is couple our work with artificial intelligence and machine learning much like how big pharma uses to develop their new products in a way that's driving us to increase the breadth and scope of the candidates that we're looking for, for implementation.And then in parallel, we're actually bringing in more capabilities to do quick tests and medium-scale tests and in the field at scale tests, but that's where we're most excited and then coupling that with some of the temperature activities we see that our confidence is growing on that front.OperatorYour next question will come from the line of Carlos De Alba with Morgan Stanley.Carlos De AlbaJust on Indonesia. I wonder if you can give us perhaps an update on how the conversations are for obtaining the export license, the extension of the export license in June? And also, any conversations that you may have had with the government and your local partner on extending the contract beyond 2041 ahead of time?Richard C. AdkersonYes. Thanks, Carlos. It's all of these things are happening in parallel with each other. The -- to get the contract extension approved, and there's widespread support for it within the government, requires some procedural actions to deal with existing government regulations and then also to amend the IUPK that we were grant it in December of 2018, that would be a fairly simple process. So we are really encouraged by it. The June date, it has to do with this broader issue the country is pursuing with downstreaming for minerals broadly. And so that's why that was there. We don't anticipate that will be something that would limit our ability to continue operations beyond June.Anything more, Carlos, to be specific on it that...Kathleen Lynne QuirkI'll just point out that our IUPK that we entered into that Richard referred to in 2018 allows us to continue exports through -- at point, contemplated December 2023. And that has some force majeure provisions, which clearly the delays that we've experienced related to COVID and supply chains are force majeure. So our IUPK allows us to do it, but we need to get the approval from the government to put in this regulation after the IUPK was signed to restrict exports in a broad range, and it's not defined which minerals they're trying to achieve.But we're working with the government. We are keeping them informed and they're visiting our copper smelter site. They're very impressed with the progress that we've made. Unfortunately, it's not going to be finished. It will be -- the construction will be substantially complete by the end of this year, but it won't be completely finished. And so we'll need the ability to continue to export.And importantly, with the alignment we now have with the government ownership, it's very important for the government revenues as well for exports to continue. So we're going to continue to work on it. We don't have the extension beyond June yet, but we do expect to get it.Richard C. AdkersonAnd Kathleen is right that we have these legal rights that are documented, but I want to emphasize, we're working cooperatively with the government and not just pushing our legal rights, and we're getting a good response from it.Carlos De AlbaRight. Okay. And just one clarification. For the extension beyond 2041 or the contract beyond 2041, is this something that requires legislative approval or is it just an executive decision, obviously, together with the ministries and all that?Richard C. AdkersonThe government will decide really how to document it. There is a path forward for it to be done without formally going through new legislation. We do benefit now by having strong support within the parliament of Indonesia, who visited our operations, the parliamentary group overseeing mining came to the U.S. and visited us here. So I just want to emphasize the whole tone has changed. You the President visited our operations in late August, early September and it was a very positive -- one of the highlights of my career there in Indonesia was his visits, and we're building off of this to find the right way forward and do it in a way that everybody wins from it. The government would win, the local community, the workforce, suppliers to our business. So that's how we're working together to see how can we go forward and makes nobody benefits from us having any kind of drop dead date on operations there. It would really be hard to envision. And this 2041 date was in our original 1991 contract of work, was carried forward in the 2018 IUPK and we actually have not done significant delineation drilling to see the extent of the resource beyond what's been necessary to fill up the production profile through 2041. And yet, in doing that, we have a very substantial resource beyond that already identified. But I'm really excited about the opportunity to go in and drill to see -- in the 30-plus year history of Grasberg, it always has gotten bigger over time. And I'm confident as we do more drilling, it will continue to be -- to grow and be bigger just because of the nature of the ore system there and the grades that are available to us, it's really exciting. And so that's what we want to achieve with the government is to get the extension granted then undertake an active program of delineation.We only report reserves through 2041, and this would give us a chance to develop reserves beyond that date and to develop -- and to come up with plans for developing those reserves for future growth. It's just a great long-term asset as a base for our company for its future.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Brian MacArthur with Raymond James.Brian MacArthurI just want to follow up a little bit on the leaching situation, and I appreciate all the detail. I just want to clarify, I think you said most of this was internal, so it's not Jetty. But then you made a comment about the bulk of its Morenci. Morenci is sort of 50% of the stockpiles, but there's a whole bunch of other North American stuff. Is there a tank house issue? Or is that 800 million constrained going forward by anything else? Or could it just be bigger if you can do stuff at Bagdad and Sweden and everywhere else?Kathleen Lynne QuirkBrian, we have latent tank house capacity across the business of about 1 billion pounds a year. And it's in different places. But that is what makes this so compelling is that there really isn't a lot of incremental capital involved in these initiatives. So historical leach production, if you go back decades, has declined over time.And we're just having a resurgence of what it once was. And this new data available to us that's telling us what's going on within the stockpiles is providing us with a road map to kind of have a renaissance of the prior leach production. So if need be, we could invest in new tank house capacity, but the low-hanging fruit is, we've got latent tank house capacity at many of these sites.So we're really approaching this across the footprint. But the highest impact is to date has been at Morenci. And that will likely be the lion's share of where we get additional pounds. But we have opportunities across the footprint.We also have inactive operations and active leach stockpiles that we can look to in the future. But the first, the lowest hanging fruit and the highest-value is in places where we're already leaching.Richard C. AdkersonYes. Morenci is the world's largest leaching operation today, and it was where much of the modern leaching technology was originally developed decades ago. So I just wish I could have a good way of conveying the excitement of our team working on this. It's really fun to see. We're leaching everywhere, and we're going to leach to the last drop. So it's -- and the benefits are just -- no permitting to do this kind of stuff. There's very little capital -- tank house capital, if it's necessary, is not significant in the bigger picture of things. And the climate, the carbon emissions are -- so it's a winner on every respect, and that's why we're working cooperatively with other companies and with jetty and focusing on what we can do on our own because we do it on our own, we capture all the economics for our shareholders. So it's a multifaceted deal and like I said, it's really a lot of fun. It's injected a level of enthusiasm into our whole organization that's really fun to see.Brian MacArthurI might be pushing it here. But just as a related thing, you also talked about North American staffing, asset efficiency of 200 million pounds. So that has nothing to do with any of this. That's independent. What actually is that part of the equation?Richard C. AdkersonWell, it's not limited to the mining industry. Certainly, it's not restraining us with our efforts to advance leaching. But it's an issue that -- as I talk with other CEOs in the business roundtable, everywhere people are experiencing it. Some of it grew out of COVID in the way people are approaching life/work styles as they go forward, but it's a real issue for us, and we're attacking it by aggressively recruiting for people, but also it's spurring our efforts to see what can we do with technology to make our business less labor intensive. But it is a real issue in the U.S., not in Peru, Chile, Indonesia, but it's just a significant matter in the U.S.Kathleen Lynne QuirkBut Brian, it's basically getting our mining rates up and also getting our plant and processing to reliability standards consistent with what we've experienced in the past. So some of the experience levels have impacted us for the reasons Richard just talked about. But this is -- these are things -- these are self-help items, and we've already got efforts underway to work on it and a game plan for how we're working on, but it's an opportunity that we don't need to go do a major project to go get.And so again, the leach initiative, the initial leach initiative and this self-help work that we're doing is some of the highest value opportunities we have in the near term.Brian MacArthurRight. And while 1 billion pounds, I guess, it's equivalent to being one of the biggest -- one of the top 5 copper mines in the world?Kathleen Lynne QuirkYes.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Timna Tanners with Wolfe Research.Timna Beth TannersI want to look at -- I wanted to look at Slide 5 and kind of the cadence as you described and kind of understand what the trajectory is going forward? So is the -- it sounds like the Peruvian situation has really improved from what we hear. So is that fully behind and we can expect this run rate going forward? I know you talked about labor issues continuing, but I assume the weather, we are not going to forecast interruptions there. So I just wanted to get a little bit more about the cadence you'd expect in the regions and any impact on costs that might be lingering?Richard C. AdkersonKathleen, I'll start by just making a comment about Peru. There are different issues in different parts of the country of Peru. And the -- and our operations is located just off the outskirts of the city of Arequipa, in the Arequipa region. And while there were protests there, they weren't as large as a protest in other areas.And we did have some disruptions of personnel movement and supplies for a period of time. And in our region, it has improved. The issues have not been resolved in the country. And so that remains there as an ongoing risk. But as you look at this trajectory issue, I think it's important to look at individual regions and see what's going on there and not assume that because we made such improvement that, that's carried forward to the same extent in other regions. So it's complicated. This whole business is complicated, but that Peru, it's very complicated.Kathleen Lynne QuirkAnd Timna, you can look at Slide 26, and that has our quarterly sales volumes for the balance of the year. The first quarter was impacted by these disruptions, but also we had the conversion to tolling in Indonesia, which we had projected going into the quarter.But you can see where we expected to be -- where we expect to be on a run rate for the balance of this year. And you can see very, very strong recovery from first quarter in the balance of 2023.Timna Beth TannersAnything on the cost side as a second part of the question, I had asked? Is that also kind of out of the woods for most of the group besides the labor issues?Kathleen Lynne QuirkWell, the first quarter, we had $1.76, and we're projecting for the year to average $1.55. So our cost -- unit cost in the balance of the year will be less than they were in the first quarter. We talked about some of the inflationary items easing from last year and that's principally energy. We saw the big spike in energy starting around this time last year.And some of the other input costs that were exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine situation. Some of those things have declined in East and so that's helpful. But we still have labor or services costs that were contracted for some of our components -- equipment components, all those things are still with us in 2023. So we've got some elements of relief and some elements of costs that are higher. They're no higher than what we estimated at the beginning of this year, but still higher than they were last year.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC.John Charles TumazosCould you give us some color on the February escalation $38 spot moly whether there was some specific shortage, probably there were some high purity customers that had to get the good moly? I noticed that the spence concentrator began reporting moly output to (inaudible) for January and presumably, (inaudible) will start in April and May.You were not the source of the supply increase, but maybe you have some insight as to where this -- where else the supply might have rebounded when the price doubled?Kathleen Lynne QuirkJohn, I'll comment and Mike Kendrick can add to it. But partially, what happened in the first quarter was some of the same supply issues for moly that impacted copper. And the situation in South America, particularly in Peru, did have an impact on supplies.And at the same time, we were seeing some strong growth in demand. So there's extreme tightness in the first quarter and some of that got relieved in Peru when things started to return to more normal operations. We continue to see, as we look forward, demand drivers for moly being positive in the supply side, which will fall a lot like copper is, it's just a challenge to bring on new supplies. And many times, as you know, in a copper mine that has byproduct moly when people get into trouble with operating constraints, copper is the one that people try to maximize and sometimes moly isn't maximized in those scenarios. But that was, I think, the main thing that occurred from a moly perspective on supply.And Mike, I don't know if you want to add. There's other things that we should add to that.Michael J. KendrickNo, I think you captured it very well, Kathleen. I mean when you -- I think it really highlights what a tight physical market moly is. And as a result, there's no attenuation when there's a demand need in any given week, and there's not supply available, you can see both rapid increases and rapid decreases through the system.And as to your question on quality, we're a large player in that area and we conduct that business under contract. So most of our high-quality material has designated 100% all the time to those products.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.Michael Stephan DudasAs you indicated in your prepared remarks, you talked about observation at (technical difficulty) the fact that this validation takes attention away from growth capital into (inaudible) capital. What do you think the risk is a year from now that is -- is there upside or downside risk towards supply given those dynamics as you work through it over the next 12, 18 months?Richard C. AdkersonYou were breaking up a bit, but you were asking about the supply-side risk assessment, right?Michael Stephan DudasYes, yes.Richard C. AdkersonSo if you go back several years when the projects that are now coming on stream were first announced, there were to be massive. There was projected massive surpluses in this calendar year, calendar year '24-'25 and those projects got delayed for different reasons, COVID hit, and they're not having the major surplus situation this year as markets basically balance and looking '24, there's potential services. But there's not new projects of significance coming on stream after that. So I would say that the supply side risk is more -- much more on the downside. We've seen issues related to meeting production, projections being higher for various reasons. The Peru situation and operational issues like we had in Indonesia occurred in other places. So I think for -- if you look back for a long-term history, supplies projections tend to be -- the projections tend to be higher than reality when experience actually happens. And I think that's where we are now. It's -- we have this leaching project, which gives us some upside. But overall, the risk, I think, are more on the downside.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Matthew Murphy with Barclays.Matthew MurphyJust a question on the cash flow statement. Noncontrolling interest distributions were 0 this quarter, which I guess it's happened a few times in the past, but what drives that? And in this case, is it -- should we assume that there's going to be a bit of catch up later in the year?Kathleen Lynne QuirkThe first quarter, we had some significant taxes that was expected. We had some significant taxes that we paid in the first quarter related to the prior year period. And so we did not have distributions in the first quarter as that was used to fund those expenses. But we do expect that you'll see that line item increase throughout the year. We're generating a lot of free cash flow at PT-FI and at Cerro Verde and that those funds will be distributed. So in terms of thinking about it, we do provide some guidance on the impact of noncontrolling interest on our net income and the estimates for cash flow are similar to that, maybe a bit lower than the earnings impact, but somewhere in that neighborhood.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Orest Wowkodaw with Scotiabank. Our next question will come from the line of Lawson Winder with Bank of America Securities.Lawson WinderI just wanted to touch on Chile where there's been some positive developments. Is the environment there now improving in the correct direction such that El Abra might look more promising for an expansion? And then could you just also please share your views on the outlook for the regulatory environment there for mining?Richard C. AdkersonWell, Lawson, it's still uncertain. And while there were some -- from our perspective, some positive developments that have occurred since this process started, we're still waiting to see where it ends up. There's fiscal issues relating to royalties and taxes. There are also regulatory issues related to water use and other impacts on the environment. And bigger picture is better than it has been, but there's still significant uncertainties that we and other miners will wait to see how they play out.Kathleen Lynne QuirkWe're doing some things now to maintain optionality. We're planning some investments in desalinization which will not only benefit the opportunity for us to extend existing operations, but also give us some ability for the potential mill project. As we talked about earlier, we're doing some work on leaching, and that could continue to evolve our expectations about the design of the new expansion project. So we're keeping options open. We're making some advances to enhance that optionality.But we're -- the project at El Abra is very strong. We are in the process of updating our capital cost numbers to reflect what the current environment is. But El Abra has a huge resource. We're talking about potentially increasing production there, and you saw the numbers in the press release -- I mean in our slide presentation. And that project is likely a project that will get done. It's a question of -- it's not if, it's when. And we're working to keep the analysis updated so that -- and move forward with some of these initiatives to put us in a position to move more quickly when we make the decision.OperatorYour next question comes from the line of Bendik Folden Nyttingnes with Clarksons Securities AS.Bendik Folden NyttingnesLooking at that potential doubling in demand within a 12- to 15-year timeframe, what's your thoughts on taking on one of those large-scale resources in some of the more underexplored jurisdictions of the world and bring it forward as a greenfield project? Is that something you're looking at, at all? Or will you rather focus your strengthened balance sheet on the organic growth pipeline and potential industry consolidation?Kathleen Lynne QuirkRichard, I'll take that one. We're really focused on our organic opportunity then you see the portfolio we have -- we're really fortunate to have organic growth that some others not everyone has within our industry. And as we've looked at greenfield opportunities over many years, you haven't seen huge greenfield success, it's rare.It's not -- we're not saying it can't be done, we keep our finger on the pulse of what the availability of greenfield is. But our focus is on our brownfield opportunities, the leach opportunities we had, someone noted earlier that it's a major top line if we can get the leach opportunity to reality.And so our focus is more on the lower risk more certainty around our brownfield opportunities while continuing to monitor what's available in greenfield. We spent a little bit of money on greenfield exploration. But our focus, because of our pipeline and asset profile, is focused more on brownfield.OperatorOur next question will come from the line of Chris LaFemina with Jefferies.Christopher LaFeminaSo Kathleen, you mentioned the increases in CapEx guidance really primarily to early investments in Bagdad for future expansions, I think back in October, Richard had said that investment in growth was on hold because, obviously, the macro environment was not very good.So I'm just wondering, has anything changed in Freeport's view of the world over the last 6 months? Is it just that China has reopened? Is it because supply issues are getting worse? Or is there just no change, and this was kind of the natural progression for these projects?Kathleen Lynne QuirkNot really any significant change. This really gets to optionality. The work that we're doing on -- the early works, a lot of it relates to tailings infrastructure that we would have to do anyway several years out, but we'd have to do any way to support Bagdad's life of mine plans. And so this is bringing some of that forward so that if we do decide to move forward with Bagdad, we'll be in a better position to bring it on more quickly.But it doesn't change. We still have the challenges of Bagdad of just -- not only just economic uncertainties, but the challenges of just housing and people for the project. But this project, the acceleration of the tailings infrastructure will give us options as we go forward.And that's what this is really all about for us is maintaining optionality within our portfolio to be able to -- none of this happens overnight, but to potentially move more quickly. And...Richard C. AdkersonBut having said that, and without underappreciating the uncertainties in today's world, I would say, for our industry, the economic situation has improved from where it was midyear last year.Throughout this, China's demand for copper in the second half of the year was strong. I believe it was the strongest second half that they've ever experienced. And we're encouraged by the GDP growth in 2023. We recognize the comments about it being driven by consumers and that there's continuing issues. Inflation has improved. And so I think the overall environment has improved in recent months. But as Kathleen said, that's not really what's driving our decisions. The Bagdad project faces worker issue, housing issues. Chile is restrained by continuing political uncertainties. But we're -- we believe all these projects will be needed by the world, they'll be very profitable for our shareholders. And so we're investing in them, planning for them and anticipating that the time will come when we execute on them.OperatorOur final question will come from the line of John Tumazos with John Tumazos Very Independent Research LLC.John Charles TumazosLooking at Slide 14, that includes the desalination plant, could you give us a little bit of background on that? It rains a lot, obviously, in Indonesia. Why were freshwater supplies not adequate? Could you have used saltwater for cooling, I'm assuming that most of the water is for cooling and the big smelter? Or is this sort of a community relations thing to not draw upon local water supplies?Kathleen Lynne QuirkWe looked at a number of options, John. This is not of water, and this isn't a big part of the project in terms of capital requirements. We thought this was the best option for reliable water for the project. But Cory, I don't know if you want to add anything to that, but that was the thought process, but we did look into a number of options for water and designing the overall configuration.Cory StevensYes. We looked hard at freshwater options. And when we make a decision around water, we're looking decades out in the future and what the social -- potential social impacts are going to be and what future demands are going to be and the renewability of those sources and came to the conclusion that desalinization was the best route and then you look at the capital cost differences to use saltwater versus desal and this became the most prudent route for us.OperatorWe'll now turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks.Richard C. AdkersonWe appreciate your participation and your interest. If you have further questions, contact David Joint, and we'll be happy to respond to them. We look forward to reporting in the future on our progress.OperatorLadies and gentlemen, that concludes our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.]"

This week, we expect a pickup in U.S. first-quarter earnings results. Some major banks have already reported, beating market expectations for profits. However, according to FactSet data, first-quarter earnings are expected to experience the largest decline in three years, marking the second consecutive quarter of such declines. Amid this doom and gloom situation, analysts are upgrading stocks such as Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), among many others.The market experienced a quiet evening and morning with little news to report on April 20. Stocks in the US and Europe remained steady, while Europe's composite reading saw a jump thanks to service strength, despite softness in manufacturing. Japan's core CPI exceeded the St consensus, but the BOJ isn't expected to take any policy actions at the next meeting. Chinese stocks fell, with the media citing ""Biden's investment curbs,"" but the curbs have been anticipated for some time. Bloomberg reports that the PBOC will scale back pandemic-era stimulus measures, but China's domestic macro story remains strong. While there were no significant developments in earnings reports since the US close, several large industrial firms have expressed optimism about the global growth outlook.Chuck Grom, an analyst at Gordon Haskett, upgraded Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) rating from Accumulate to Buy. At the same time, UBS analyst John Hodulik upgraded Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) from Neutral to Buy. Meanwhile, notable stocks, including Coterra Energy Inc.

And out of all of the metrics and results to consider, earnings is one of the most important.The earnings figure itself is key, but a beat or miss on the bottom line can sometimes be just as, if not more, important. Therefore, investors should consider paying close attention to these earnings surprises, as a big beat can help a stock climb even higher.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Expected Surprise Prediction, or ESP, works by locking in on the most up-to-date analyst earnings revisions because they can be more accurate than estimates from weeks or even months before the actual release date. The thinking is pretty straightforward: analysts who provide earnings estimates closer to the report are likely to have more information. With this in mind, the Expected Surprise Prediction compares the Most Accurate Estimate (being the most recent) against the overall Zacks Consensus Estimate. The percentage difference provides the ESP figure.Now that we understand what the ESP is and how beneficial it can be, let's dive into a stock that currently fits the bill. Insulet (PODD) earns a Zacks Rank #2 right now and its Most Accurate Estimate sits at $0.16 a share, just 13 days from its upcoming earnings release on May 4, 2023.Insulet's Earnings ESP sits at 70.21%, which, as explained above, is calculated by taking the percentage difference between the $0.16 Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.09.PODD is just one of a large group of Medical stocks with a positive ESP figure. Regeneron (REGN) is another qualifying stock you may want to consider.Slated to report earnings on May 4, 2023, Regeneron holds a #3 (Hold) ranking on the Zacks Rank, and it's Most Accurate Estimate is $9.99 a share 13 days from its next quarterly update.Story continuesRegeneron's Earnings ESP figure currently stands at 5.8% after taking the percentage difference between its Most Accurate Estimate and its Zacks Consensus Estimate of $9.44.PODD and REGN's positive ESP figures tell us that both stocks have a good chance at beating analyst expectations in their next earnings report.Find Stocks to Buy or Sell Before They're ReportedUse the Zacks Earnings ESP Filter to turn up stocks with the highest probability of positively, or negatively, surprising to buy or sell before they're reported for profitable earnings season trading.

Netflix and Taiwan Semiconductor, a key Apple supplier, issued guidance warnings too.There were more layoffs at Meta and Clorox, with reports of planned job cuts at Disney.Tesla reported a quarterly gross margin miss on recent price cuts.The bottom line is that there is an ongoing negative shift in economic data, likely as interest rate hikes take further hold in the economy.

This means that investors might want to take advantage of these earnings surprises.2 Stocks to Add to Your WatchlistThe Zacks Earnings ESP is more formally known as the Expected Surprise Prediction, and it aims to grab the inside track on the latest analyst estimate revisions ahead of a company's report.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of Dalio’s investment philosophy and portfolio construction, go directly to the Top 5 Technology Stocks to Buy in 2023, According to Ray Dalio.Billionaire Ray Dalio argued in a recent interview on the Julia La Roche Show that global central banks are less willing to hold the US dollar for two reasons. First, the greenback has serious competition for the first time in many decades from the Chinese yuan. He noted that China's share of global trade is ascendant while the US share is shrinking. Most importantly, China is promoting trading agreements centered on its currency rather than the dollar, which has been the norm for a long time. Secondly, Western sanctions against Russia and several other countries have exposed new risks for holding dollar-denominated assets. For instance, the US and its allies froze Russia's assets, with the US Fed freezing currency reserves. To Dalio, the action was not only high-handed but spooky to global central banks that hold dollar-denominated currency reserves.Last year, Dalio said during CNBC's Squawk Box interview that investors are better off not keeping cash because inflation had reached dangerous levels. Instead, he argued that putting the money in a well-balanced portfolio was safe. He also spent time discussing his latest book, ""The Changing World Order,"" in which he shares valuable insights on the current geopolitical and economic cycles.Dalio has made bullish comments on China's tech sector, arguing that it is vibrant and poised to challenge the United States. At home, Dalio was among the loudest speakers regarding the possibility of a tech stock bubble pre-2021. He said in an interview in early 2022 that the Fed's rate hikes would hit hard the 'bubble-type' tech stocks. His thoughts were prescient because several tech stocks lost significant value in 2022 after the Fed's sustained campaign of rate hikes.Story continuesTop 10 Technology Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Ray DalioRay Dalio of Bridgewater AssociatesOur MethodologyWe picked top 10 tech stocks from Bridgewater Associates' 13F portfolio as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2022. Although the billionaire retired from Bridgewater, he remains a mentor, board member and investor at the firm.Top Technology Stocks to Buy in 2023 According to Ray Dalio10. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $24.89 million Percentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 0.13% Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 117Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) provides streaming entertainment services, including TV series, movies, documentaries, and mobile games in multiple languages and genres, available on various internet-connected devices. The company has around 231 million paid subscribers across 190 countries.On April 18, Credit Suisse analyst Douglas Mitchelson raised his price objective on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) to $331 from $291 and retained a ‘Neutral’ rating before Q1 earnings report. Credit Suisse predicted positive investor feedback on Netflix's Q1 earnings with increased revenue and margin improvement but anticipated management's caution on Q2 subscriber numbers due to potential password-sharing launches and seasonal effects.Bridgewater Associates owns 84,422 shares in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), valued at more than $24.89 million, which accounts for 0.13% of the hedge fund's portfolio. The hedge fund has boosted its stake in the firm by an impressive 101% in the fourth quarter of 2022.Out of the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 117 hedge funds were long Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) during the fourth quarter with aggregate stakes worth $8.15 billion. This compares to 115 hedge funds holding $6.66 billion in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in the previous quarter.Like Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:FB), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the tech stocks on the radar of Ray Dalio.In its Q4 2022 investor letter, Broyhill Asset Management stated the following about Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX):“Speaking of fresh names, we established a new position in Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) during the second half. We began accumulating shares after the company reported two consecutive quarters of subscriber losses, which brought the stock down by about 75% from peak to trough. Our investment in Netflix is a good example of what we categorize as a “temporary dislocation” and a great example of the historical investments we’ve made in the tech sector. Unlike other “value” investors, we don’t arbitrarily put tech in the “too hard” pile. We are comfortable and more than happy to underwrite investments in the industry. We just demand a margin of safety when doing it (something often ignored by other investors in the industry). That margin of safety opened up when consensus quickly concluded that Netflix’s growth was over, on the heels of two quarters of subscriber losses, which happened to follow years of surging lock-down-induced demand. The popular narrative was that by pursuing advertising revenue, Netflix was all but admitting that streaming television was completely saturated. We thought otherwise. With ~ 75MM subscribers in the US, even converting a small portion of those 100MM moochers would move the needle3. And given the superiority of the company’s technology and first-party user data, we think the consensus is completely underestimating the long-term potential of a Netflix advertising model.”9. International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM)Value of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Position: $28.67 million Percentage of Bridgewater Associates’ 13F Portfolio: 0.15% Number of Hedge Fund Shareholders: 43International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) provides integrated solutions and services globally, operating through four business segments: Software, Consulting, Infrastructure, and Financing, offering hybrid cloud platform and software solutions, business transformation and technology consulting services, server and storage solutions, and financing services.Securities filings reveal that Bridgewater Associates boosted its stake in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) by 8% during the fourth quarter of 2022.

The most prominent shareholder in International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM) is Adage Capital Management, with 919,590 shares valued at $129.56 million.In its Q4 2022 investor letter, Diamond Hill Capital stated the following about International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM):“New positions initiated in Q4 included shorts International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), Acushnet Holdings (GOLF) and elf Beauty (ELF). Since diversified information technology company IBM’s 2019 acquisition of Red Hat, the company has aggressively pursued a hybrid cloud strategy. Though IBM and its new management team have made solid progress on this pivot, we believe the company still meaningfully lags the cloud hyperscalers and other cloud-native companies. Management has also laid out aggressive long-term targets for revenue growth and free cash flow, both of which we believe the company will struggle to achieve as it faces intense competition in its hybrid cloud business and structural headwinds in the company’s legacy businesses.”8.
